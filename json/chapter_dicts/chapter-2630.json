    "text": "At that moment, the Sky Palace students felt as if giant boulders had been lifted from their shoulders. They breathed deep sighs of relief.\n\nHan Sen was the best in the Sky Palace, but Exquisite faced him calmly. For some time, Han Sen hadn\u2019t been able to harm a single hair on her head. The woman had stood against his attacks, as steady as a mountain. Seeing Han Sen\u2019s attacks fail had crushed the Sky Palace students and prevented them from breathing. It made them think Exquisite was a god that couldn\u2019t be beaten.\n\nBut then, Han Sen\u2019s knife was able to cut Exquisite\u2019s clothing. Seeing that small victory calmed the anxious audience.\n\n\u201cContinue,\u201d Exquisite said. She waved her sleeves, and the Teeth power was extinguished like someone had tossed a bucket of water over a campfire. Han Sen waved his hand again, using Fang to attack Exquisite. This time, he used even more power and speed.\n\nExquisite finally moved, but she only took half a step. That was enough for Han Sen\u2019s Fang to go wide and miss her. Even so, it didn\u2019t look as if she was going to fight back.\n\nHan Sen pushed himself to release even more power, making the next move a few times stronger than the last. He used his Teeth Knife once again. Exquisite\u2019s feet moved gracefully, lightly sliding her to the side and letting her dodge every Teeth Knife attack Han Sen launched. Han Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife was unable to touch Exquisite\u2019s clothes a second time.\n\n\u201cAlthough Han Sen\u2019s speed can break through the effect that Exquisite is casting on the arena, he cannot catch up to her. This isn\u2019t a good situation for Han Sen to be in. Han Sen needs to overcome both the skill she is using and her own innate speed,\u201d Thousand Feather Crane said, as he understood Han Sen\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cVery High powers are so scary. It\u2019s like they\u2019re cheating. The whole universe is helping her,\u201d Yun Suyi said with depression.\n\n\u201cOf course. Otherwise, the Very High wouldn\u2019t have become the best race, would they? Even born-deified Ancient Gods envy their power,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\nAs this was going on, Sky Palace Leader observed Han Sen with great interest. He smiled and said, \u201cThe Very High are known for their strength. To fight against the Very High is to fight against the whole universe, in a sense. Although Exquisite\u2019s level is low and she cannot change the universe much, any of her other peers would be at a severe disadvantage against her. Unless you are one or two tiers higher than the Very High, it is difficult to fight them. How Han Sen seeks to deal with this will be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think Han Sen actually stands a chance in this fight?\u201d the woman asked in shock. She turned to the Sky Palace Leader with a quizzical expression on her face. \u201cI thought you always liked him, too,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\n\u201cI liked him because of his powers of blessing and the deified weapons he wields. His talent isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s probably better than those of anyone else on his level, but his skill alone won\u2019t be enough to deal with the Very High. I\u2019m not saying that Han Sen is weak; it\u2019s just that the Very High are too strong,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, maybe this will work out for Han Sen anyway,\u201d the Sky Palace Leader said thoughtfully as he watched Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen cast another strike with Teeth Knife. Then, he stopped attacking.\n\n\u201cWhat other geno arts do you have? Use them,\u201d Exquisite commanded. She still wanted to see more of Han Sen\u2019s powers, so she didn\u2019t attack yet.\n\nAs the Sky Palace students watched Exquisite, it was as if they were looking at a Valkyrie that couldn\u2019t be defeated. Once again, she had become untouchable.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t intimidated, though. He had seen Exquisite slave away as a maid to the crocodile gods, so he couldn\u2019t think of her as some unbeatable creature.\n\nPlus, Exquisite\u2019s power didn\u2019t seem entirely unbreakable to Han Sen.\n\nMany Sky Palace students froze as they looked at Han Sen. If they were in his shoes, they knew how desperate they would feel. They wouldn\u2019t even be able to ruffle Exquisite\u2019s clothes. They just wanted to know if Han Sen had a sufficient amount of power to break Exquisite. If he was unable to break her, and Exquisite unleashed a strike, she would only need that one skill to beat Han Sen. After all, the universe was strengthening her might. It was hard to imagine how crippling that strike might be.\n\nHan Sen swung his hands and spoke to Exquisite. \u201cI\u2019ve finished warming up. Now we begin.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! Warming up? That was just him stretching?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Han\u2026 this bluffing of yours is a bit too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! Brother Han is Brother Han. His bluffing is so fresh.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had been using power that only the best ninth-tier Kings could match. There was no way that he had been holding back the majority of his strength.\n\nBut even so, the Sky Palace students began to grow a little excited again. When they looked at Exquisite, she no longer seemed quite as untouchable as she had before.\n\nWhen Exquisite had first turned on her Very High Eye, her emotions seemed to disappear. She had seemed perfectly calm since then, but now she frowned.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s poker face is too good\u2026\u201d The Sky Palace Leader wanted to laugh.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just like you when you were young,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I was really strong. I didn\u2019t pretend like he is,\u201d the Sky Palace Leader immediately corrected her.\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes at him. She didn\u2019t say anything further, but scorn seemed to drip off of her.\n\nThe Sky Palace Leader was very smart, and he stopped talking. After all, that woman knew everything about his past. \u201cSince we\u2019re done practicing, let us begin,\u201d Exquisite said very calmly. She had only shown her emotions for the tiniest moment, and what Han Sen said didn\u2019t affect her much.\n\nVery High\u2019s Forget Love was no joke. Exquisite\u2019s level with it was low, but a deified Very High could watch her husband and children be humiliated and killed in front of her without feeling a single thing. \u201cThen you must look closely.\u201d Han Sen slowly raised his right hand. He clenched his fingers together to make a fist.\n\nEveryone could see Han Sen preparing to unleash a punch, but he suddenly stopped. \u201cHave you heard the old saying?\u201d \u201cWhat saying?\u201d Exquisite asked.\n\n\u201cI am the greatest of my league,\u201d Han Sen said. He said each word slowly.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Exquisite knew what Han Sen meant, but her expression never wavered. Actions spoke a lot louder than words.\n\nWhen the Sky Palace students heard him, they thought this was too much. But judging from Han Sen\u2019s situation, it wasn\u2019t too much.\n\n\u201cThen you should learn it now.\u201d Han Sen swung his fist.\n\nBzzt!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body tore through the fabric of space, disappearing from everyone\u2019s vision. When he appeared again, he punched Exquisite square in the face. Exquisite\u2019s nose fountained blood as her body was sent soaring away. She crashed into the sealing of the arena with such force that even the protective shielding shimmered.\n\nAs this happened, all of Sky Palace fell silent. The students were so silent that they could have heard a rat fart."
