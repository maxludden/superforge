    "text": "Han Sen had obviously planned this.\n\nBecause Han Sen let Nine-Headed Bird strike first, Nine-Headed Bird had a chance of winning. That was why Nine-Headed Bird agreed to the bet. But Han Sen\u2019s dragon area defeated Nine-Headed Bird\u2019s first attack, and the moment he stopped attacking was the moment he sealed his loss.\n\n\u201cCan I go now?\u201d Han Sen smiled at Nine-Headed Bird.\n\n\u201cGet lost! Do not let me see you ever again.\u201d Nine-Headed Bird\u2019s face was contorted with anger. Without waiting for Han Sen to respond, he turned and flew away.\n\nHan Sen was surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected Nine-Headed Bird to keep his promise, but it was a good thing he had.\n\nThe dragon area\u2019s power came from its connection to water; if Han Sen was sealed inside the Suppress Demon Coffin, he would lose his connection with the sea and get pulled into the demonic abyss.\n\nUnless Han Sen used his super god spirit body, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat Nine-Headed Bird.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Han Sen flew up into the air and headed back to Half-Star Bay. He didn\u2019t say another word to Xius.\n\nIf Miss Mirror hadn\u2019t left yet, that was where she would be. Too many elites wanted to get their hands on the Ancient God Origin. Staying next to Miss Mirror would be the safest thing for Han Sen, as it would prevent others from trying to take the item away from him.\n\nAlthough Han Sen could probably escape, Bao\u2019er was still with the Extreme King. So, Han Sen felt obliged to remain.\n\nHe flew for a few hundred meters, but suddenly, he felt the crackle of lightning all around him. A giant that looked like either a demon or a god hung there in the clouds. A hand came slapping down towards Han Sen.\n\nThe hand slowed down, and the air around Han Sen concentrated until it was as dense as a steel board. Han Sen couldn\u2019t tear through the air. He couldn\u2019t move his body.\n\n\u201cA deified elite!\u201d Han Sen felt a chill, and he prepared to fight back. Just as he was about to lash out, a sword-light appeared and slashed across the big hand.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d The giant in the clouds screamed and pulled his hand back. The god-like eyes looked down to where he had been struck. A beautiful woman holding a copper sword in her hands had emerged.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror!\u201d Han Sen was so happy.\n\nThat giant stared at Miss Mirror, then disappeared. He seemed to be afraid of Miss Mirror, and he obviously didn\u2019t want to make an enemy out of her.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe Ancient Water God selected you.\u201d Miss Mirror came before Han Sen and looked at the Ancient God Origin he was holding.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you brought me here?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI was just here to try my luck. I didn\u2019t place any hope in you, so I didn\u2019t expect you would succeed,\u201d Miss Mirror said simply.\n\nHan Sen touched his nose and looked at the blood-red sea.\n\nMiss Mirror seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. In a neutral tone of voice, she said, \u201cExtreme King ships are here. They will take over the planets that were touched by Ancient Water God\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror hadn\u2019t come for the Ancient God Origin at all; she just wanted to claim the system that had been flooded with Ancient Water God\u2019s blood.\n\nAfter Ancient Water God\u2019s failure and the subsequent dispersal of his blood, the primitive creatures of these planets would now grow strong. Even barren planets would now flourish because of Ancient Water God\u2019s lifeblood.\n\nThe watery area that came from Ancient Water God\u2019s blood had an incredible lifeforce. It could grow many scary xenogeneics. This was exactly what the Extreme King needed.\n\nOn the flipside, the Ancient God Origin wasn\u2019t as important. It could only be used to grow one strong water element elite. It was nothing compared to the value of an entire system.\n\nHan Sen followed Miss Mirror back to the ship, and he saw that the Extreme King\u2019s ships were splitting up to guard the individual planets of the system.\n\nHan Sen found the blood kirin was on their ship, and he was surprised that it had sat and waited for him the entire time. It obviously wasn\u2019t the mindless beast Han Sen had believed it to be.\n\nWhen the blood kirin saw Miss Mirror, it looked hostile and scared.\n\nHan Sen could guess why. Ancient Water God had moved Han Sen far away, and the blood kirin wouldn\u2019t listen to Miss Mirror\u2019s commands. She must have used some sort of trick to get the creature onboard a ship.\n\n\u201cThis woman is too tricky. I don\u2019t know what she wants. Why didn\u2019t she tell anyone else that I\u2019m not actually Bai Yi?\u201d Han Sen stroked the ring on his finger and thought to himself, \u201cIt most likely has something to do with this ring. But she didn\u2019t force me to take the ring off. Why?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t understand. He knew he would have to stop thinking about it. He brought out the xenogeneic gene of the Silver-Winged Dragon and swallowed it to refine it.\n\nDuke Gene +1\u2026 Duke Gene +1\u2026\n\nThe Duke gene announcements kept sounding-off in Han Sen\u2019s head. He received ten Duke genes in total.\n\n\u201cIf I can get a few more King class xenogeneic genes, then I won\u2019t have to worry about The Story of Genes.\u201d Han Sen was both happy and worried.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t remain on the planet for long. She had been needed during the takeover, but she wasn\u2019t in charge of building up the planet. Her task was finished before most of the Extreme King\u2019s ships even arrived.\n\nHan Sen knew Miss Mirror had many elites around her, but they didn\u2019t appear in her proximity.\n\nTaking such an important system would be a bloody affair.\n\nThe Ancient God wouldn\u2019t give up the place easily, so both sides would make sacrifices in the attempt to claim the system. The price would be high whether they succeeded or failed.\n\nAfter going back to King\u2019s Kingdom, Han Sen took the blood kirin with him back to Planet Water Zone. Miss Mirror didn\u2019t detain him, and she said nothing more to him. No one else sought to trouble him, either.\n\nThat made Han Sen even more worried, though. He didn\u2019t know what was going through Miss Mirror\u2019s head, and he had no idea what her ultimate goal was.\n\n\u201cI can just put Bao\u2019er back in the sanctuaries. That will be safer for both of us,\u201d Han Sen thought in irritation. He would need to take Bao\u2019er back from Lan Haixin.\n\nBefore Han Sen could find Lan Haixin, though, she came looking for him. She looked fairly moody, too.\n\n\u201cBai Yi, did you forget something?\u201d Lan Haixin found Han Sen in the garden and looked at him with a raised eyebrow. She didn\u2019t say what she wanted explicitly because she was still suspicious about Han Sen\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cLast month, on the ninth. I remember. But Miss Mirror took me somewhere to do something. I had no choice,\u201d Han Sen said with a shrug. He then thought to himself, \u201cIt is fortunate I have Bao\u2019er as a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good that you remember. But since we missed it, we must now wait another two months. You better behave over the course of the next two months and stop giving me trouble.\u201d After Lan Haixin spoke, she left. She didn\u2019t even spare him a second glance."
