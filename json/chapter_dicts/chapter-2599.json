    "text": "Han Sen didn\u2019t believe him, but he hadn\u2019t yet tried the test that Yu Shanxin had suggested. He wanted to help Lone Bamboo, but he wasn\u2019t going to the Very High on his friend\u2019s behalf.\n\nSeeing Han Sen leave, Yu Shanxin smiled. He did not get mad at Han Sen\u2019s rejection.\n\nBack on the small jade island, Han Sen continued to absorb King genes. He wanted to get The Story of Genes to the ninth tier as soon as he could.\n\nHan Sen called Gu Qingcheng over to discuss the matter of Lone Bamboo. Gu Qingcheng listened to his tale and said to him, \u201cYu Shanxin is correct. It doesn\u2019t matter who ends up going, but Sky Palace will need to send someone else to the Very High. Their demand cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cSky Palace has many people. Is it necessary for me to go?\u201d Han Sen said. Gu Qingcheng shook her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that simple. If it was, Sky Palace wouldn\u2019t have put their beloved son in jail. I don\u2019t think Sky Palace can choose which individual goes. They will need a person that interests the Very High. Otherwise, a swap won\u2019t work. And that is why Yu Shanxin is trying to convince you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I won\u2019t go even if they personally invite me. And he wants me to beg before the Very High like I\u2019m a slave?\u201d Han Sen said with a lift of his lips.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that. To normal people, going to the Very High is a grand opportunity. They are the ones who want to do the begging. You and Lone Bamboo are special. If you weren\u2019t special, I don\u2019t think the Very High would care as much as they do now,\u201d Gu Qingcheng smiled as she spoke.\n\n\u201cIs there no other way?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThat would depend on Sky Palace. If they don\u2019t want to enter a disagreement with the Very High, they will have to send someone no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe two of them discussed the matter a little more, but they were unable to come up with any ideas. Their power wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough to go against the Very High. Whatever they tried would be ineffective.\n\n\u201cIf Lone Bamboo hasn\u2019t been taken away, that means there is room for negotiation. We will find a way to navigate through this.\u201d Han Sen kept trying to think of a way to help Lone Bamboo as he practiced.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, there is a meeting with the Very High. Are you joining?\u201d Yun Suyi asked with a look of anger. She had come over to visit the little jade island.\n\n\u201cWhat meeting?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion. He had been recovering there for some time, so he hadn\u2019t heard a thing about a meeting Yun Suyi explained, \u201cThe younger Very High and Sky will be exchanging geno arts. They said there is to be a discussion, but it is more like the Very High will talk and we will just sit there listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will they talk about?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\n\u201cThe geno arts of the Very High are very expansive. They know the geno arts of many races, so they can talk about anything.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re really that good? Maybe I should go and listen, then.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t really want to go and listen to geno arts. He just wanted to confirm that this Exquisite was the same Exquisite he had encountered in the core area.\n\nHe established a time with Yun Suyi. The next night, Han Sen took Bao\u2019er and Gu Qingcheng with him. He met up with Yun Suyi and some other people from Sky Palace. Together, they joined the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was taking place on Thousand Lake Island. That island was strange. Its center was a lake, and the lake\u2019s water constantly spilled onto the lower levels of the island. The whole island was like a sloped collection of lakes.\n\nThe Very High held their meeting at the center of the lake. There was a lotus platform that was around the size of a soccer pitch. It was floating in the center of the lake, and there were pavilions scattered around it.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived, the meeting area was full of Sky Palace students. Most of the students could only listen from their pavilions. Some of the higher-class students were able to sit on the lotus platform itself to talk directly with the Very High.\n\nThey said they were going to occupy the same tables as everyone else, but the Very High were actually occupying the primary seats. The Sky Palace students could only sit to the side. And it was usually the Sky Palace students that had to ask questions. The Very High were always the ones answering. They were like teachers answering their students.\n\nThousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters brought Han Sen and Gu Qingcheng to the lotus platform. The Sky Palace students knew all about Han Sen. They greeted him and immediately allowed him to take the finest seats.\n\nHan Sen only wanted to find someplace random to sit down, but the people there were excited. The Sky Palace students kept pushing him forward, and so he couldn\u2019t refuse them. He had to sit down someplace more distinguished.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like the students of Sky Palace forced him deliberately. Everyone knew about Han Sen fighting Meng Lie in the systems of chaos. There wasn\u2019t a person in Sky Palace who hadn\u2019t heard the story. He was a King class that could defeat Meng Lie. He deserved to take the number one seat, above the Sky Palace Kings and half-deifieds.\n\nPlus, Han Sen was quite famous in Sky Palace. He and Lone Bamboo were called the knife and sword masters. They had become teachers. If Lone Bamboo wasn\u2019t there, then it was natural for Han Sen to sit in the most respected position.\n\nNot long after, both sides of the lotus platform were full of Sky Palace students. But the center seats were still empty.\n\n\u201cDo the Very High really think so highly of themselves?\u201d a Sky Palace student asked coldly. It was because of Lone Bamboo that the Sky Palace students disliked the Very High. That meeting wasn\u2019t going to be as cordial as previous ones. But while everyone discussed the Very High, a white jade carriage flew toward them. The jade beasts that pulled the carriage were like tigers of some sort. They looked almost like a mascot. They were obviously special.\n\nWhen Han Sen looked the creatures over, he was surprised. He didn\u2019t recognize what species the jade beasts belonged to, but when he felt their presence, he could immediately tell they were deifieds.There were six of those jade beasts pulling the carriage. That power was something even Sky Palace\u2019s leader could appreciate. Han Sen was surprised by how strong these Very High must be when he saw their mode of transportation.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s initial assumption that the carriage belonged to Exquisite was wrong. It was for the use of Very High who were visiting other races. Many Very High used it, so it didn\u2019t belong to anyone in particular. The beast carriage drove over to the lotus platform. There, the beautiful jade car\u2019s door opened. A man and a woman emerged.\n\nJust as Han Sen thought, that woman was Li Keer\u2019s Third Sister, Exquisite. But this time, it wasn\u2019t Li Keer who was accompanying her. It was a man.\n\nThe man and the woman walked to the primary seats and bowed before everyone. The man said airily, \u201cI am sorry to have kept you guys waiting. If there are no other matters to discuss, let us get on with it. If you have questions, ask them. My sister and I will try to answer every question we are posed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sounds way too cocky. He said this was an exchange, but it sounds more like a teacher talking to children,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nWhile they were talking, Exquisite and the Very High man took a seat. The man looked at the Sky Palace students on both sides.\n\nHe saw Han Sen occupying the first seat with Gu Qingcheng next to him.\n\nWhen the man looked at Gu Qingcheng\u2019s face, his own face froze. He stared at her a little, and then pulled his gaze away."
