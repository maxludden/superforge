It did seem powerful, but there was no apparent utility. It could not be used as a weapon, and it was certainly too small to be used as a shield.\n\nHe wanted to spend some time researching it, but the red bird was hungry again. It had already flown over to the corpse of the Devil Fang King and begun pecking away at it. Within seconds, it had managed to gobble up an entire arm\u2014bone included.\n\nQuickly, Han Sen ran up to the bird and pulled it away. He was afraid it would eat the Life Geno Essence.\n\nWith his Phoenix Sword, Han Sen dug up the black orb from its inside. He was quite excited about this, as it had been a long time since he had last received one.\n\nHe cooked some of the flesh, but found it impossible to eat. Humans were unable to consume the flesh of super creatures, but Han Sen always thought it was worth a shot.\n\nAffirming his inability to eat it, Han Sen offered it to Bao\u2019er and the red bird. Bao\u2019er\u2019s reaction was similar to Han Sen\u2019s; upon having a taste, she threw it up.\n\nThe red bird was strangely ravenous. Within moments of being given a leg, it had munched it all and swallowed it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want the bird to eat it all, though. Han Sen summoned Golden Growler and Meowth, and bid that they have some to eat, as well.\n\nThey really seemed to enjoy it. Meowth paced the bites and ate slowly, whereas Golden Growler stuck his nose in the food and ate like a wild, hungry animal.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before no scrap or morsel of the Devil Fang remained. The red bird ate the most, Golden Growler had a fair share, and Meowth ate the least.\n\nHan Sen wanted to put Golden Growler and Meowth back inside the Sea of Soul after that, but all of a sudden, Golden Growler began to shine like a torch of light. Before Han Sen could do anything, it returned itself to the Sea of Soul.\n\n\u201cIs Golden Growler evolving?\u201d Han Sen was more than surprised.\n\nHan Sen believed Golden Growler was quite a special creature. After Little Angel ate Golden Growler, she grew and evolved quickly. The beast soul Han Sen received was a mountable one.\n\nMount beast souls could not eat like pet beast souls could, but Golden Growler strangely could. Mount beast souls weren\u2019t ones to attack, either; yet Golden Growler did.\n\nHan Sen had been feeding it some good stuff, like the waterdrops, and had witnessed a few changes to its body over time. But they weren\u2019t extravagant or immediately noticeable transformations.\n\nAfter eating Devil Fang King, though, it was as if something had been unlocked. And with this lock having been broken, it was like the creature could now evolve.\n\nHan Sen did not know what to expect from its evolution, or what it would become, but regardless, it was a good thing. He was eager to see the results.\n\nIt did not really matter, though. As with Meowth, Han Sen treated Golden Growler like little more than a mascot.\n\nFor now, Han Sen chose to leave Golden Growler alone. He simulated the Devil Fang King\u2019s energy flow and absorbed the Life Geno Essence.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mood had been repeatedly caught on a snag lately. His Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s open gene lock amount was too low, he believed, and this was truer than ever right now, as he was unable to simulate Devil Fang King\u2019s energy flow well. This was because Devil Fang King had nine open gene locks, and as a result, the refinement process was very slow.\n\nAfter an hour passed, Han Sen had only managed to absorb the outermost layer of the orb. He hadn\u2019t even been able to receive a single geno point yet.\n\nHe guessed it would take an entire month to refine the Life Geno Essence, and that was only if he focused on absorbing it 24/7.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d Han Sen was still moderately satisfied.\n\nAfter packing, Han Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and allowed Disloyal Knight to lead the way. It was high time they got out of there, Han Sen thought, so that was their aim right now.\n\nWith Disloyal Knight, Han Sen was no longer afraid of super creatures. If one thought to try its luck against them, he believed they could wipe it out without any trouble.\n\nThe black mist was as thick as ever, and it hung in the air like mucus. It stifled Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Aura, and only allowed him to see ten meters ahead. Every now and again, a Devil Fang would show itself.\n\nSacred-blood Devil Fangs were supremely easy to defeat, and that was down to the power and precision of his Phoenix Sword.\n\nAfter eliminating one, Han Sen felt the Devil Fang King go crazy inside the Sea of Soul.\n\nHan Sen summoned it, and immediately, it flew over to the body of the slain Devil Fang.\n\nA black mist then drifted out of the Devil Fang\u2019s body and into the badge. Then, it was gone.\n\nHan Sen retrieved the badge and noticed something different about it this time. Inscribed upon it was the number \u201cone.\u201d\n\nHe checked its information out again and saw there were some changes.\n\nSuper Beast Soul Devil Fang King: Badge Type. Devil Presence +1. Collect ten thousand to trade with Devil King.\n\n\u201cWhat is Devil King? And trade? Trade what?\u201d Han Sen had no idea what he was reading.\n\nRegardless of what it meant, Han Sen now knew the badge had to be useful. He had killed one Devil Fang to obtain one Devil Presence. If the ratio was truly 1:1, then that meant Han Sen had to kill ten thousand of the blighters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a crazy grind, but if I keep killing what I see along the way, perhaps I\u2019ll have slain enough.\u201d Han Sen only said this to comfort himself, though. Killing ten thousand of anything was too difficult, not to mention boring.\n\nThe Devil Fangs were sacred-blood creatures at the very least, and if they were keen to remain hidden inside the black mist, there was nothing Han Sen could do, anyway.\n\nHan Sen now decided to pin the badge to his chest. Whenever the chance to kill one arose, he would do it. And just like before, the Devil Presence would appear as some sort of dark mist and drift towards the badge to be absorbed.\n\nHan Sen decided to fly around, and after eight hours of doing that, he was able to kill another twenty Devil Fangs. Unfortunately, he had not been able to obtain a single other beast soul.\n\nThis got Han Sen thinking: if the Devil Fang King badge absorbed the Devil Presence, perhaps there\u2019d be no beast soul for him to get.\n\nWhile this was rather lame, he was glad he was still able to eat the corpses. While he couldn\u2019t eat much at a time, he stuffed his face with what he could and moved on from each kill. The bird made sure to grab a mouthful every time one was killed, too.\n\nAll of a sudden, though, Han Sen\u2019s face changed. He saw the copper devil-woman statue ahead of him again, and he wondered whether or not he had ended up walking in a circle. But this time, a black shadow stood atop the statue\u2019s head. The presence\u2019s lifeforce looked like a raging bonfire of power, and its magnitude was not too far off of Xie Qing King\u2019s."
