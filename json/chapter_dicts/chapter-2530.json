    "text": "Han Sen promised to help Li Keer kill a deified xenogeneic, but Li Keer didn\u2019t know where the xenogeneic she needed actually lived. She only knew which system it was said to be in. Han Sen had to go to that system with her.\n\nBut this time, Li Keer didn\u2019t offer to teach God\u2019s Wander to Han Sen first. She was going to wait until Han Sen slew the deified xenogeneic before giving him the final part.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Teleport and Galaxy Teleportation were just a down payment.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t upset about that. It wasn\u2019t as if he and Li Keer were family, so this was normal. If Li Keer taught him the skills without anything to gain, he wouldn\u2019t know how to repay the favor.\n\nHe was chatting with Li Keer on the way, and he was pleasantly surprised to learn that Li Keer was well-educated about most geno arts. In fact, she spoke of many that Han Sen hadn\u2019t even heard of. Aside from the woman in Two World Mountain, there was no one Han Sen knew that was as smart as Li Keer.\n\nHan Sen himself was very good at geno arts. He had studied them a lot, but he had never poured his full energy into those studies. He focused more on practicing geno arts rather than researching them.\n\n\u201cWith Li Keer\u2019s knowledge, and with her being King class, she should be famous in Sky Palace. Why haven\u2019t I heard her name before?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nAfter visiting the system Li Keer told him about, they searched for the deified xenogeneic for two whole days without finding anything. They did manage to kill a dozen King core xenogeneics, though.\n\nThe system was huge. If they searched every planet, it would take a while.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen had continued studying Teleport and Galaxy Teleportation, and searching the system was a perfect opportunity to practice. Han Sen teleported everywhere he needed to go. He was getting the hang of it. He was a fast learner.\n\nThe two of them and the furnace were hurrying along their way when, all of a sudden, they saw a group of people coming toward them. Han Sen had a closer look, and he noticed it was Dia Robber, Dragon One, and a few others.\n\nAt this point, Han Sen considered them to be old friends. He had expected Dia Robber would come looking for him. He hadn\u2019t expected it to take this long for Dia Robber to find him, however.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, do you have some free time to help me kill a core deified xenogeneic? We can discuss the price.\u201d Dia Robber knew Dollar\u2019s personality well, so he didn\u2019t beat around the bush. He jumped immediately to his real request.\n\n\u201cI do have the time, but I have just struck a deal with this Lady Li. I need to help her kill a xenogeneic, too,\u201d Han Sen said, nodding to Li Keer.\n\nDia Robber and Dragon One looked at Li Keer. They didn\u2019t know her. She was one of the Sky, too, so they didn\u2019t pay much attention to her after giving her a once-over.\n\nDia Robber looked happy and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Can I book you in for next time?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, but I don\u2019t have a lack of xenogeneic genes at this point. If you want my help, I\u2019m going to need a geno art as a reward. Lady Li is rewarding me with a geno art, and that is why I\u2019m helping her,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\n\u201cGeno art? What geno art do you want?\u201d Dia Robber was surprised.\n\n\u201cI have heard your race has a geno art called Big Destroyed. From what I\u2019ve been told about it, I find it quite interesting,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 is there any other geno art I can give you? Big Destroyed is a secret geno art of the Destroyed. We don\u2019t teach it to outsiders. Plus, without the body and talent of a Destroyed, it\u2019s impossible to learn Big Destroyed. It wouldn\u2019t work, even if I did give it to you. If you are interested in geno arts, I can give you another geno art that is on the same level as Big Destroyed,\u201d Dia Robber offered.\n\nHan Sen shook his head, looking determined, \u201cFor the time being, I\u2019m only interested in Big Destroyed. Please think about it, Brother Robber.\u201d\n\nHe had too many geno arts to practice already. He didn\u2019t have any time to take on more geno arts that he didn\u2019t already need. He only wanted Big Destroyed so he could use it as a replacement for Consume. That way, he could absorb things faster.\n\n\u201cWe can talk about this more as we travel. What kind of deified xenogeneic are you looking for? If you aren\u2019t opposed to the idea, we can help you out with your task.\u201d Dia Robber smiled.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have anything to pay you with,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cBeing allowed to follow Brother Dollar is enough of a payment already.\u201d Dia Robber smiled.\n\nIf someone was offering to help them for free, Han Sen had no reason to refuse the offer. So, he brought Dia Robber and the others along. Han Sen had witnessed their powers before, and he knew they could be useful in the hunt for a deified xenogeneic.\n\nHan Sen told Dia Robber and the others about the xenogeneic Li Keer wanted to kill, asking if they had already seen it.\n\n\u201cLi Keer is hunting the Sea Sky Eye?\u201d When Dragon One and Dia Robber heard the deified xenogeneic\u2019s name, they were shocked.\n\nLi Keer smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not that powerful. Hence why I asked Dollar for his aid.\u201d\n\nDia Robber sighed and said, \u201cThe Sea Sky Eye is known as one of the stronger deified xenogeneics in the core area. He is no weaker than Gold Armor General was. Many races have tried to fight it, but no one has been able to hurt it.\u201d\n\nDia Robber spoke in a hesitant manner as he tried to explain the situation to Han Sen. If he wasn\u2019t standing in front of Li Keer, he would have told Han Sen not to take the job.\n\nThe Sea Sky Eye was very destructive to Kings and half-deifieds. It was scarier than the Gold Armor General had been.\n\nBut Dia Robber couldn\u2019t offend the Sky, so he tried to tell Han Sen in a non-direct way. The Sea Sky Eye was a scary being.\n\nHan Sen nodded. \u201cI have heard the Sea Sky Eye appears someplace in this system. Do you know where it can be found?\u201d\n\nLi Keer had mentioned that the Sea Sky Eye was very scary, but Han Sen wanted the final part of Galaxy Teleportation. So, he wasn\u2019t planning on running.\n\nEven if he couldn\u2019t deal with it, he could always use the Peacock King\u2019s soul robe and the Gold Robot General.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to determine. The Sea Sky Eye hangs around this system, but it doesn\u2019t have a nest. And it sometimes leaves this system. Encountering it all depends on luck,\u201d Dragon One said.\n\nDragon One and Dia Robber didn\u2019t know where the Sea Sky Eye could be found. There was nothing Han Sen could do about that. His only option was to keep trying his luck, hoping to meet the Sea Sky Eye.\n\n\u201cI know that the Sea Sky Eye will be difficult to find. If you guys need Dollar, I can lend him to you first. I\u2019m not in a rush.\u201d Li Keer seemed to be an easy woman to get along with.\n\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Dia Robber was happy to hear this, but then his expression soured a little. He said, \u201cBrother Dollar, aside from Big Destroyed, is there no other geno art you would be willing to learn?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am only interested in one geno art. I have no interest in any others.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s answer was very resolute.\n\n\u201cIn that case, can you give me some time? I will talk to my people.\u201d After Dia Robber said goodbye, he left the core area.\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be able to get Big Destroyed now,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He had so many xenogeneic genes left, and at his current rate, he could only eat three a day."
