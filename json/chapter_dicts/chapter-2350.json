Han Sen\u2019s hands were so strong that he managed to pull two of the dragon\u2019s teeth right out.\n\nThe silver-winged dragon raised its head and shrieked. Blood gushed from the gaps of the missing teeth. The dragon blood diffused into the sea, dying that portion of the water red.\n\nHan Sen was now holding two dragon teeth in his hands. He swam through the water toward the dragon again, then threw the two broken-off teeth into the dragon\u2019s belly.\n\nThe silver-winged dragon curled its body in pain at the blow. It really wanted to bite Han Sen, but when it lowered its head, a gold fist smacked into its jaw.\n\nThe dragon\u2019s huge body was sent soaring away with the force of the punch. It floundered through the air, still writhing in pain.\n\nHan Sen looked at what his fist had done, and he could scarcely believe it. His power was so strong when it combined with the power of the Kingese. He had managed to break the silver dragon\u2019s king area with a punch and send the beast flying.\n\nA powerful King creature didn\u2019t stand a chance in rivaling Han Sen\u2019s newfound strength. It was difficult to imagine how strong he had become under the buffing of the Kingese.\n\nAs a Ghana woman was sailing over the ocean, the surface of the water suddenly exploded in front of her. The water fountained up like a spring, and a silver dragon flew out of the sea, screaming. Its body was twisted and bleeding all over.\n\nXius\u2019 face paled. \u201cThat\u2019s a silver-winged dragon, a King class xenogeneic!\u201d\n\nBefore Xius could compose a second thought, a gold shadow emerged from the water in pursuit of the dragon.\n\nThe gold shadow chased after the silver-winged dragon, throwing punches with blinding speed and power. The dragon was taking a pummeling from pure physical power.\n\nThe dragon\u2019s silver king area was ripped apart by the attacker\u2019s fists like a soap bubble being popped. The silver-winged dragon\u2019s blood and scales were flying everywhere. Sharp cracking sounds echoed over the water as the dragon\u2019s bones started to break.\n\nKatcha!\n\nWith its bare hands, the gold shadow ripped the dragon\u2019s head off its body. The beast\u2019s blood sprayed across the sky and descended like rain.\n\n\u201cHan Sen!\u201d When Xius got a better look at the attacker, her eyes widened in surprise.\n\nWhen she met Han Sen among the Dragons, he could barely fight Dragon Nine. Now, he had just killed a silver-winged dragon with his bare hands. That was unexpected, to say the least.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Silver-Wing Dragon. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Silver-Winged Dragon beast soul.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was left clutching the dragon\u2019s head. He punched and the dragon\u2019s skull cracked open, revealing a draconic orb that fell into Han Sen\u2019s hand. It was the silver-wing dragon\u2019s xenogeneic gene.\n\nHan Sen put away the dragon orb and looked over at Xius. He looked happy.\n\nThe Kingese started to fade, and Han Sen moved over to Xius.\n\n\u201cLong time no see, Han Sen. I can\u2019t believe you have become this strong,\u201d Xius said, her voice friendly but her body slightly tense.\n\n\u201cYou have the wrong person. I am Bai Yi, Sixteenth Prince of the Extreme King,\u201d Han Sen said harshly.\n\nXius looked surprised. She looked up at Han Sen with evident confusion.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t explain anything further, and he asked Xius, \u201cWhy are you here? Have you seen any other creatures about?\u201d\n\nAncient Water God had brought Han Sen there, summoned a water dragon, then disappeared. Han Sen had no clue where he currently was.\n\nXius shook her head. \u201cAncient Water God showed himself. He is going to level up to become a god spirit in Half-Star Bay. Everyone in the vicinity is headed there, but I\u2019ve come all this way and I haven\u2019t seen anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf-Star Bay?\u201d Han Sen frowned, as he didn\u2019t know anything about the place.\n\n\u201cI am going there right now. If you\u2019re willing to come, Prince Sixteen, we can travel there together,\u201d Xius offered.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here, prince?\u201d Xius didn\u2019t believe his claim that he wasn\u2019t Han Sen, but she also didn\u2019t challenge him on it. When she spoke to him, she referred to him as Prince Sixteen.\n\n\u201cI was just out for a nice swim.\u201d Han Sen had no intention of explaining how the Ancient Water God had dragged him out there.\n\nAfter pausing, Han Sen asked, \u201cThere are so many creatures here that are hoping the Ancient Water God will fail. Won\u2019t that make him angry?\u201d\n\nXius smiled and said, \u201cAncient Water God is known as the God of Life. He never kills. People here are happy to watch him ascend, and it\u2019s not as if people are going to disturb his leveling up process. He won\u2019t get mad.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \u201cAncient God is an interesting race. If I had p*ssed off any other deified elite, they definitely would have killed me. He left me out there and sent a silver-winged dragon after me once I woke up, but it seems that he didn\u2019t really want me dead.\u201d\n\nHan Sen traveled with Xius all the way back to Half-Star Bay. As they approached, they noticed giant waves rolling across the sea. The waves were so high that they seemed to soar across the sky like dragons, and they got taller and taller as time went on.\n\nThe clouds seemed to rip apart, reducing to whiffs of nothing. In fact, dimensions were twisting across the entire planet, and strange scenes unfolded everywhere Han Sen looked.\n\n\u201cWe are too late in reaching Half-Star Bay. Ancient Water God is already in the middle of leveling up to become a god spirit.\u201d Xius sighed. They pulled to a stop.\n\nHan Sen kept watching the twisted sky. It looked like something was about to appear in the twisted clouds.\n\nThe wavy seas suddenly all surged in one direction. A giant body was forming on the horizon, pulling its mass from the seawater.\n\nAll the water on the planet was being drawn to Ancient Water God, and his body swelled bigger and bigger.\n\nThe endless sea dried up quickly, leaving the creatures in the ocean gasping on the dry seabed. Without water, their death came in minutes. Ancient Water God\u2019s body stood so tall that it looked like it was holding the sky. The massive figure turned its head up, looking at the sky above.\n\n\u201cWater is life. It is at the basis of everything. I am an ancient spirit. I am the god of water. I crush the world in the name of the water, and I will earn the body of a god spirit.\u201d Ancient Water God\u2019s voice echoed far beyond the planet he stood on. Throughout the universe, wherever there was water, the Ancient God\u2019s power began to flow. It was like all the sources of water were giving their powers to him, right then and there.\n\nThe water of the universe was now all moving, headed for Ancient Water God\u2019s body, strengthening him. The terrifying sight made many King class beings want to kowtow before him.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe fabric of space was torn, and an old and mysterious palace was revealed. When it emerged, the water of the galaxy came to a stop. Every drop of water that was going to Ancient Water God hovered in place.\n\n\u201cThe geno hall?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. It was the second time he had seen the geno hall. The last time he saw it was when Kong Fei started a war."
