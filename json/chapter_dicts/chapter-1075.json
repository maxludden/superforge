It was grey like steel, and its back had a shield that was similar to that of a turtle\u2019s shell. It reached down to its tail, which was shaped like a drill.\n\nThe head of the creature possessed a curved horn. The claws were sharp, and they lined up like a vanguard of spears.\n\nWhatever it was, it was sitting upon the head of the devil-woman statue. It looked at Han Sen and Disloyal Knight, presenting a creepy smile.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe creature jumped and appeared directly before Han Sen. With its fingers raised, it tried to penetrate Han Sen\u2019s chest and seize his heart.\n\nDisloyal Knight ran up with its halo active and delivered a punch to the creature.\n\nDong!\n\nWhen Disloyal Knight\u2019s fist came into contact with the creature\u2019s armor, his fist was knocked back. It started to bleed with the force of his proposed punch.\n\nThe creature on the receiving end had not suffered any pain from the powerful blow.\n\nHan Sen turned into a golden raven once again, but this did not faze their latest foe. It didn\u2019t attempt to dodge any attack Han Sen brought against it, and instead, it just continued its attempts to slice and dice him.\n\nThe gold raven\u2019s talons were incredibly sharp, but they did nothing to the creature. And upon delivering a powerful strike to the creature, he was the one who ended up bleeding, just like Disloyal Knight.\n\nHan Sen was surprised to see that the bulk of the super creature\u2019s strength resided in the defense provided by its armor.\n\nHe tried to burn the metal of its armor, but the flames had no more effect than a water splash.\n\nThe body of the creature was like a hedgehog, and already, they were having trouble touching it.\n\nAlthough its speed and power were weak, that meant nothing if neither Han Sen nor Disloyal Knight was able to take advantage of this fact and damage it.\n\nIf Han Sen was in his human form, he could use his Taia and Phoenix Sword. But even then, Han Sen wagered he\u2019d still be too weak to deal damage. Not even that weaponry would even the odds.\n\nDisloyal Knight, on the other hand, had no weapons. Beast souls were not like spirits, and so they could not make use of beast souls. As a result, Disloyal Knight had to use its fists.\n\nStill, Han Sen decided to return to his human form. He landed atop the head of the statue and watched from above as the two duked it out.\n\nBecause the creature had been weakened by Disloyal Knight\u2019s halo, the damage it could deliver was not substantial.\n\nHan Sen frowned and observed the creature. He repeatedly scanned it, trying to determine if there was a weakspot he could exploit.\n\nBut if there was one, it was hidden well. The armor had multiple layers, all of which were wound tightly around each other. No weapon could manage to fit through the gaps.\n\nAside from its lack of ranged attacks, the creature was perfect, Han Sen thought. It was a born killer he\u2019d very much fancy.\n\nIf Disloyal Knight hadn\u2019t deployed its debuff on the creature, one punch from that fiend would be enough to end anyone or anything, Han Sen believed.\n\nIt was like a one-man phalanx. The claws were like a wall of lances, whereas the tail was one that lashed from the rear. No shield or armor could withstand strikes from such a front.\n\nWhile Han Sen was lost in thought, the sound of a bell rung from Ancient Devil Shelter. It startled Han Sen back to reality.\n\nIt was not a sharp noise, but it traveled softly and solemnly through the black to reach his ears. He liked the sound, and its ringing made him think of an old monk ringing a bell in some faraway monastery.\n\nWhen the super creature heard the noise, it gave up the fight and darted back towards Ancient Devil Shelter.\n\nHan Sen was surprised by this sudden shift in behavior, so he summoned Dragon King and asked him, \u201cDragon King, what is that bell?\u201d\n\nDragon King remained silent for a moment, with his ears to the sky. When he heard the bell, his silence was shattered by a horrified scream. He shouted, \u201cImpossible! How is it ringing!?\u201d\n\nHan Sen, seeing the spirit behave like this, frowned. He asked, \u201cJust tell me; what is this Ancient Devil bell that\u2019s ringing?\u201d\n\nDragon King stared up towards the shelter and pleaded to Han Sen, \u201cGo to the shelter and be quick about it!\u201d\n\n\u201cCare to tell me what\u2019s going on exactly?\u201d Han Sen did not budge. He wasn\u2019t going to risk life or limb, acting on Dragon King\u2019s empty words. He wasn\u2019t the most truthful fellow, after all.\n\nThey had just had trouble dealing with a single creature, and Han Sen could not be sure how many more of that power level may have resided in the shelter.\n\nDragon King himself told Han Sen there were many wretched things residing in that place. Before he acted on his sudden change of mind, Han Sen wanted to know why.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cQuick! When the bell stops, we will no longer be able to enter. Get moving and I\u2019ll explain on the way, but trust me, please. I really don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t entirely believe him, as he used to work for Ancient Devil Emperor. He probably knew a lot more than he was letting on, and there was always the chance he could make use of this knowledge to manipulate Han Sen into being forced to relinquish control of him.\n\nDragon King was clearly in a rush, though. He said, \u201cIt will only ring seventy-two times. Once it has rung that many times, the shelter will close. Once it has closed, we will be unable to enter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you better explain to me what\u2019s up there. Tell me, so I can decide my next course of action,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King looked ready to explain, but suddenly, a large group of Devil Fangs flew towards them.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed, and so he drew his sword and prepared for another fight. But strangely, they did not stop near him. They flew overhead and went towards Ancient Devil Shelter.\n\n\u201cThe Ancient Devil bell is for the Emperor to go to Qi Ling. The bell is a geno treasure. When it rings, it provides a window in which the creatures will not seek to harm any living thing. Trust me on this, now is the time to go. Go before it is too late,\u201d Dragon King explained."
