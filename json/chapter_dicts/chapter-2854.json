Even the shockwaves from this Sky Vine Radish were the same as those from the one he had seen before. The exception was that they were more powerful.\n\nGod looked at the giant Sky Vine Radish as he said, \u201cThis is just Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god body. Without a god personality, the god body is just a shell.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch impressive power.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe him, so he asked, \u201cIs it really just a shell?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was not a shell, why would he still have not moved, especially since you have entered his temple?\u201d God gazed at the statue that looked like Sky Vine Radish and said, \u201cBreak this god body and bring out Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god personality. Then, you will learn how to use it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at God as he asked, \u201cI am not going to replace a statue in this temple, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was that easy to become a god, then being a god wouldn\u2019t be something so mighty,\u201d God said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He gathered up power and threw his palm at the god body\u2019s shell. His hand was unable to harm the motionless god body. His power felt empty when it hit the god body. It was like the god body did not even exist.\n\nGod laughed. \u201cThat is a god. How is going to be hurt by ordinary power? Unless you level up to true god class, your power cannot hurt it or its shell. Try your scabbard. That should work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? After I killed Sky Vine Radish, there was a god body of his here.\u201d Han Sen pulled out the Return Empty Scabbard. Like a knife in his hand, he put the scabbard to work. But he did not hit Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god body.\n\n\u201cGod is immortal. No creature is supposed to be able to kill a god, but gods do have their downsides. For example, gods cannot deal damage directly onto a creature of the universe. That sample applies to ordinary folk that aren\u2019t even capable of leveling up. Gods cannot kill these things themselves, but there are exceptions.\u201d God stopped talking.\n\n\u201cWhat exceptions?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart was wildly jumping. This was a secret he had wished to unravel for a long time.\n\n\u201cIf a god separates its own god personality from its god body and combines its god personality with a creature from the universe, it will generate a big universe god body. That big universe god body has a power that can ignore the limitations imposed on gods. It can kill creatures in the big universe, and the big universe loses its power of immortality too. If they are killed, or the god personality is lost, they can die.\u201d God pointed at Sky Vine Radish and said, \u201cJust like this numpty. He forced his way into the universe and used his big universe god body to fight creatures in the big universe. In the end, he was heavily wounded. He did not even have enough power to return to the temple. It enabled you to snare him so easily.\u201d\n\nHan Sen finally understood why some gods could be killed and why some gods could not be killed. That was the difference.\n\n\u201cSo, are you saying that if a god does not force itself into the universe, it will not die no matter what happens?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cAccording to the theory, that is correct,\u201d God said with a nod.\n\nHan Sen stared at God as he asked, \u201cSo, are you saying that they can actually die?\u201d\n\nGod laughed and said, \u201cDo you think I would tell you what my weakness is? You should hurry up and kill his god body. I do not want to remain in this boring place any longer.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stopped hesitating. He used the Return Empty Scabbard like a knife and slashed at the shell god body.\n\nDong!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s hit landed atop Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god body shell. It only left a very light mark, but god blood still came out from it.\n\nSeeing that the shell god body did not react, Han Sen held the scabbard harder. He kept slashing and slashing. He did not know how many times he attacked it, but he eventually lopped the empty god body\u2019s head off.\n\nHan Sen looked at God, who shook his head and said, \u201cYou cannot kill god spirits like that. You must destroy his god base.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a god base?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThe base stone of a god is the god base of one\u2019s body. You need to destroy the god base. Do that, and the whole body will collapse.\u201d Before Han Sen could ask a question, God said, \u201cEvery god\u2019s god base is different. Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god base should be in his left arm.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Sky Vine Radish\u2019s left arm. He saw that the left arm had a vine on it. Aside from that, there were no notable aspects that differentiated it from the right arm.\n\nHan Sen had to give it a shot. He waved his scabbard at the left arm of the god body shell. He did not know how many times he slashed. When Han Sen eventually cut off the left arm with the vine, the entire god body collapsed. God blood, god bones, and god flesh burst into flames. It did so in a green, glowing light.\n\n\u201cTake out Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god personality,\u201d God said.\n\nHan Sen took out Sky Vine Radish\u2019s 6-foot-long green vine bone. He watched the green light in the sky heading straight for the bone.\n\nWhen the green bone absorbed the green light, the light on the body burned brighter. Something was changing.\n\nThe old vine-looking bone suddenly turned into a green lance. The tip was curled like a snake. It displayed a god light that could not be described.\n\n\u201cGained god personality armament: Sky Radish Bone Lance.\u201d\n\nThis announcement trumpeted in his head. Han Sen looked at the Sky Radish Bone Lance. The Sky Radish Bone Lance played a message inside Han Sen\u2019s brain.\n\n\u201cSky Radish Bone Lance: Destroyed god class personality armament.\u201d\n\nThe Sky Radish Bone Lance was just like a beast soul. Han Sen thought he could drop it in his Sea of Soul, but he did not do that in front of God.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nSuddenly, a green beam of light lit up the base of the temple. In that green beam of light, Han Sen saw an old vine that looked like green jade. It was forming something.\n\n\u201cIs that Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god personality?\u201d Han Sen recognized it. That old green vine was Sky Vine Radish\u2019s bone. It was just like the green bone before it had become the Sky Radish Bone Lance.\n\nGod smiled and said, \u201cI already told you. Gods are immortal here. You brought Sky Vine Radish his god personality and destroyed his god body here. That means you killed him here. Of course, he can be reborn again.\u201d\n\nGod paused and added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Although Sky Vine Radish can be reborn again, you have still reaped the rewards. Otherwise, how could you turn a god personality into a god personality armament?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was prepared. He knew that everything God did had two sides to it. This was the other half. Han Sen was not surprised. He just wanted to remind himself that when he was with God in the future, he always had to be careful.\n\nWhile the two of them spoke, the green bone had already formed. The green bone started to generate its flesh and organs. It was rebuilding Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god body.\n\n\u201cShould I leave now?\u201d Han Sen did not want to see Sky Vine Radish alive.\n\n\u201cThis is so rare,\u201d God coldly said. \u201cNot many people can see a god spirit rebuild its god body. Let\u2019s just watch it. With me here, Sky Vine Radish will not dare to harm one hair on your head.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. He watched Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god body rebuild."
