    "text": "But now, the Spell\u2019s nine tiers had been combined and condensed into one. Its power solidified, and that new density allowed the armor to ignore the difference in power between the two fighters. Its energy could no longer be converted to the demonic element.\n\nShale was a bit shocked by this twist. He used his demonic powers a few times more, but try as he might, he was unable to change Han Sen\u2019s element. He had realized that Han Sen had discovered a way to fight back against the demonic power he wielded.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is somehow holding off the demonic power. That is a bit unexpected,\u201d Open Sky Elder said with raised eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAlthough the demonic powers no longer change him, he is still a half-deified going up against a deified. There is a large gulf in power. It will still be an incredibly difficult fight for Han Sen if he seeks victory,\u201d Qiyu Elder said.\n\n\u201cEven so, as small as it may be, he stands a chance.\u201d Open Sky Elder put all his hopes on Han Sen\u2019s newfound opportunity.\n\nAlthough Shale\u2019s demonic power had lost much of its effectiveness, Han Sen was still suppressed by his opponent\u2019s might. There was still a staggering difference in their power levels, and Han Sen\u2019s geno arts had only been reinforced to a half-deified level. It still wasn\u2019t going to be enough for Han Sen to fight a deified elite.\n\nUnder constant pressure from Shale, Han Sen had to keep changing his movements. He teleported and dodged, keeping Shale from landing a fatal blow.\n\nHan Sen still didn\u2019t have enough power to engage Shale directly. Every move Shale made carried dangerous strength, but Han Sen was managing to keep him from hitting his target.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer could feel the calmness in Han Sen\u2019s heart. Every time they saw Han Sen on the brink of death, he would surprise them and turn out no worse for wear.\n\nThey were on the edge of their seats, and the rest of the audience was even more nervous.\n\nHan Sen was walking a tightrope. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he would fall into a bottomless abyss.\n\nAlthough his situation looked perilous in the extreme, Han Sen was holding on. Beneath Shale\u2019s oppression, he was able to avoid further injury.\n\n\u201cThe cons of Shale being from a smaller race are finally coming to the surface.\u201d Li Chun Qiu sighed in his heart.\n\nShale was very talented, and he could challenge all sorts of geno arts and perform miracles with his ordinary punching techniques. With his demonic powers, he could go against any deified elite at the same level.\n\nBut now, his demonic powers weren\u2019t working. That meant the simplicity of his punching techniques might not cut it. No matter how good a driver someone might be, that skill would still only allow them to drive a car. Even the best driver in the world wouldn\u2019t suddenly develop the ability to fly planes.\n\nShale\u2019s punching skills were so simple. He could only use ordinary methods as he tried to win this fight. He didn\u2019t have the power to simply end the fight in a moment. He definitely had an advantage, but he had been unable to take Han Sen down.\n\n\u201cIf Shale could practice in Outer Sky for a few more years and learn many more top-class geno arts, with his power and talent, he could definitely defeat Han Sen,\u201d Li Chun Qiu thought to himself. He went on to think, \u201cThis Han Sen is strong. Any ordinary half-deified would find themselves completely outmatched by Shale. They couldn\u2019t fight him. Within a repetition or two, Shale would analyze their skills and break them. But Han Sen\u2019s skills have been repeated many times, and yet Shale still cannot break them.\u201d\n\nLi Chun Qiu could sense everything that Shale was feeling. Although the fight had changed dramatically, Shale was still determined to do his best to crush Han Sen.\n\nBut Li Chun Qiu could see that there were many moments Shale was certain he would get Han Sen, but each time, he failed to lay a finger on his opponent.\n\nLi Chun Qiu began analyzing Shale\u2019s mind. He finally discovered why Shale was unable to break Han Sen\u2019s skills.\n\nShale needed to see a geno art to see through his opponent\u2019s flaws. And Han Sen\u2019s use of geno arts was not flawless. There were too many flaws, to be exact.\n\nWhen Shale tried to make use of these flaws, he soon learned that the flaws were traps deliberately laid by Han Sen. They didn\u2019t do much harm to Han Sen\u2019s use of a skill, but they were enough to trap his enemy and provide Han Sen with some breathing room.\n\nEvery technique had flaws. There was no such thing as an unbreakable geno art, but Han Sen hid the true flaws of his skills within artificial flaws. For every real flaw, there were nine ones to throw his enemy off course. He let Shale guess which flaw was the real one each time. But even after all this time, Shale had been unable to guess which flaw was the correct one.\n\n\u201cThere are 50 paths to choose from, and there are 49 you can pick. Take away one, and it will become a fixed number and a variable. Imperfection is this world\u2019s true perfection. Han Sen has learned the meaning behind what it means to take away one. This guy is so scary. When he grows up, he might end up better than the kids of the Very High.\u201d Open Sky Elder stared at the battle with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cI have heard his self geno arts have required a lot of resources. Even with four years in the Very High, I don\u2019t know if he will make it to deified. Even if he does become a primitive deified, who in this universe could provide him with enough resources to keep him going beyond that?\u201d Qiyu Elder shook his head. He wasn\u2019t very hopeful of Han Sen\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame. If he was born as a Very High, he might have been another Li Chun Qiu. We would give him all the resources he required. He could have entered the Geno Hall for sure,\u201d Open Sky Elder said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. You know Old Stubborn won\u2019t let an outsider become a true child of ours,\u201d Qiyu Elder said with a wry smile.\n\nUpon hearing that, Open Sky Elder sighed and said, \u201cSometimes, I envy Zhang Xuan Dao of the Sky. At least he can do whatever he wants. We cannot do anything.\u201d\n\nQiyu Elder\u2019s face changed. \u201cYou can only say that here. Don\u2019t let Old Stubborn hear you say something like that. You know there are harsh feelings still lingering about the Sky betraying our people.\u201d\n\nOpen Sky Elder shook his head and said nothing. He continued to watch the fight between Han Sen and Shale unfold.\n\nShale\u2019s punches were like demonic lions. Every punch looked as if it could swallow the sky and eat the sun. Han Sen was like a small boat surfing the crazy waves of the sky and the ground. But no matter how scary Shale\u2019s fists were, he was still unable to defeat Han Sen.\n\nA single kernel of corn on a big sea. Han Sen was that kernel, but he could float. It didn\u2019t matter how much the sky and earth raged; they couldn\u2019t take him down into the abyss.\n\nNow, Han Sen\u2019s mind was very clear. He used Under the Sky and God\u2019s Wander. He kept casting from his hands, one after the other. Every knife seemed as if it flipped the sky and the earth.\n\nHe had practiced knives for so long. He had learned from the minds of many others, but now, it was Han Sen\u2019s own will and mind that Shale was putting under pressure.\n\n\u201cThe sky and the ground are the chessboard. I am one of the chess pieces, but as they move across the sky and the earth, the meaning of the chess pieces is increased. There are a thousand ways for them to be used, and you need a chess piece to follow a path. Without a chess piece, there is no path\u2026\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart suddenly opened up within him, and he spoke as if he was in a trance, \u201cUnder the Sky, I am the path. If I live, the path lives. If I die, then the path dies.\u201d"
