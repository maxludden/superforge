And as he clutched one, he shouted to the skies, \u201cThis is going to work! Buddha! Laozi! Jesus! RNGesus! Mary! Please, please, please! Bless me with immaculate fortune, as I walk through the valley of shoddy lootcrates\u2026 Heeyyaa!\u201d\n\nHan Sen crushed the egg, and he watched the red light that oozed out with a manic stare. With his intense gaze, he waited to see the form it\u2019d take. And then, all of a sudden, a housefly buzzed straight into his Sea of Soul.\n\n\u201cOrdinary-class Blood Fly beast soul obtained.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt as if his heart had been trampled underfoot, and he had now fallen into a deep depression. He continued tearing through the eggs before him, and he seemed to exclusively receive ordinary and primitive beast souls.\n\nQueen, on the other hand, had managed to receive four sacred-blood beast souls. She never once received anything lower than a mutant-class beast soul, either.\n\nBao\u2019er, although Han Sen could not tell their class, seemed to have been the continued recipient of greater fortune. Beast soul after beast soul rose from the cracked eggs, and powerful and monstrous red forms of light entered her forehead.\n\nHan Sen was down to one single fruit remaining. He wrestled with whether or not he should open it, and ultimately decided not to. He put it away.\n\nHe had suffered a similar misfortune when he squeezed the Dragon-Blood Fruits in the underground shelter. He let Zero crack the final one open for him, and she managed to obtain a wondrous Dragon-Blood Snake for him to use.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, you don\u2019t need those beast souls, so how about you give me yours?\u201d Han Sen gave the creepiest grin as he looked at her. Then, he took her in his arms.\n\n\u201cOne,\u201d Bao\u2019er actually answered, putting up one finger as she spoke.\n\n\u201cCome on; you love Daddy, don\u2019t you? All?\u201d Han Sen pleaded pathetically.\n\n\u201cOne,\u201d Bao\u2019er insisted.\n\nHan Sen swung his arms around, saying, \u201cOoh, that reminds me. I heard there\u2019s a new flavor of ice cream. It\u2019s a super jumbo ice cream, too. It\u2019s massive!\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er could not resist the temptation of a new super jumbo ice cream and said, \u201cOne for each super jumbo ice cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Han Sen then proceeded to lock his pinky with hers.\n\nBao\u2019er gave Han Sen all the beast souls she had received, and Han Sen could not stop smiling as this occurred.\n\nThey were all sacred-blood beast souls except for one, which was a super beast soul. The super beast soul was that fierce dragon he had seen.\n\nBlood-Demon Dragon: Flying Beast Soul\n\n\u201cHaha! It\u2019s a super class flying beast soul; I love you Bao\u2019er!\u201d Han Sen repeatedly kissed her cheeks.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fine mood had returned, better than ever. He had now managed to receive two super beast souls from his escapade at the shelter. First, he had managed to receive the super mantis armor, and now he had received super wings.\n\nWith the wings, Han Sen could use phoenix techniques while remaining in his human form. The blood-demon wings increased his speed and power, too; so that was a welcome trait.\n\nHan Sen summoned them, and immediately, giant dragon wings appeared across his back. He gave them a test flight and was delighted to learn he could fly at a speed that was greater than what the super-class mantis could achieve.\n\nFlying speed always came down to the beast soul itself. Although he wasn\u2019t as strong as one, Han Sen at least now had the speed to match any super creature.\n\nQueen thought it was ridiculous, how he had received another super beast soul. Particularly given the manner he received it: bribing it off Bao\u2019er.\n\nShe then planned to give Han Sen the beast souls she had received and not keep them.\n\n\u201cKeep them; I don\u2019t need them,\u201d Han Sen told her. He also provided her with a few more sacred-blood beast souls he did not need. \u201cYou might need them to protect yourself, in the event I\u2019m not there.\u201d\n\nQueen did not say anything and just did as he said. She knew she was weak, and she could not hold her own and fight side-by-side with Han Sen as she might have once been able to.\n\nHan Sen then had another idea. He decided to give Queen his Polluted Devilhorn King scimitar. As he did so, he told her, \u201cTake this, as well; I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew the creatures in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary were strong, and the emperors there always had super creatures and spirits in their employ. He might need her back-up, as many of the trials ahead might require him not to go solo.\n\nSince he did not need those beast souls, it was best to have a moderately-powerful sidekick accompanying him.\n\nQueen accepted the scimitar but did not say anything.\n\n\u201cSafety first. If something happens to me, my life may be in your delicate hands. This gear will help,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nQueen was too hard on herself, and even Han Sen thought the wounds she had sustained earlier were far too wretched. He didn\u2019t want to see her in a condition like that again.\n\nShe blushed and simply walked back to the teleporter, returning to the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen also went back, bringing Bao\u2019er with him. He fulfilled his part of the bargain with her and bought her a lot of snacks.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s luck was as good as Zero\u2019s. Evidently, he could not open stuff and expect decent results. It seemed he would have to rely on Bao\u2019er, for the time being.\n\nTwo days later, Han Sen planned his next route and set-off away from the barrens.\n\nBefore he left, Bai Yishan gave Han Sen a call, bidding that he come visit him in the Saint Hall.\n\nOn the communicator, Bai Yishan didn\u2019t mention exactly what he wanted to discuss, but it did sound important. Without any elucidation, he just told Han Sen to come see him in the Saint Hall.\n\nBai Yishan had treated Han Sen like a proper student; it was something he was very grateful for. Therefore, Han Sen had no problem adhering to his desire, and went to go see him at once.\n\nThis was the first time he had been to the headquarters, as ordinary people weren\u2019t usually allowed. But Han Sen was not an official student, so he had to wait outside.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, why are you here?\u201d Han Sen heard someone ask."
