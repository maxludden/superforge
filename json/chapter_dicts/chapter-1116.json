It also gave Wang Lin more material to attack with.\n\nLi Singhua was famous in the Saint Hall, so if he suggested a subject to embarrass Han Sen, and Han Sen lost, it wouldn\u2019t reflect well on him. Therefore, someone like Li Singhua wouldn\u2019t give an advantage to his students. He\u2019d have to select a subject that was fair and square.\n\nIf Li Singhua suggested a subject and Han Sen won, it would mean Wang Lin and his colleagues were dumb. It wouldn\u2019t reflect poorly on Li Singhua himself.\n\nThere was no personal grudge between Professor Li and Han Sen, and Professor Li was most certainly not going to make himself an enemy on Wang Lin\u2019s account.\n\nHan Sen had thought of all this, so that was why he so happily made the suggestion to Li Singhua. Wang Lin, with a spectrum of view and thought that was not as broad, believed Han Sen was merely being naive.\n\n\u201cTeacher, give us a subject! We won\u2019t embarrass you,\u201d the angry man said.\n\nWang Lin quickly retorted, saying no. He said, \u201cTeacher, if he loses, he will say that it was because it was a subject you have taught us before.\u201d\n\nWang Lin was still oblivious to what was actually going on.\n\nLi Singhua simply smiled and said, \u201cIf you want me to suggest a subject, I will.\u201d\n\nLi Singhua pulled out his communicator and sent information to Han Sen and Wang Lin. \u201cThis is what I have been researching in my own free time. Come find me when you have the results I wish to see.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Li Singhua left. Wang Lin and his friends followed.\n\nHan Sen read the information he had been given while eating. It seemed like a fairly easy subject.\n\nIt was very simple, as a matter of fact. The topic was on research on the energy flow cycle.\n\nHan Sen thought it was simple due to his experience with energy flows. When he uses Dongxuan Sutra, he could simulate three or four different energy flows simultaneously.\n\nBut the information he had been given concerned itself with something a little different.\n\nLin Singhua\u2019s research was about making two different energy flows run inside the body at the same time, but without either of them affecting the other.\n\nThat meant practicing two hyper geno arts without either touching.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think such a thing was possible, due to the blood pulses being connected. Every Qi Gong had to flow through the pulses, and they couldn\u2019t overlap.\n\nLi Singhua had performed many tests with this subject. He had used many different hyper geno arts in trying this out, but the results were always the same. They always overlapped.\n\nHan Sen knew it\u2019d be impossible. When he practiced the Dongxuan Sutra, he could only practice the Dongxuan Sutra. He couldn\u2019t practice the Dongxuan Sutra at the same time he practiced the Blood-Pulse Sutra. If he ran two energy flows inside him, at the same time, he\u2019d be lucky if he didn\u2019t blow up.\n\nIt was then that Han Sen realized the truth of why this subject had been selected. It was an impossible question, and it\u2019d get him and Wang Lin to stop fighting.\n\nAfter returning to the lab, Bai Yishan called him.\n\n\u201cDid you have an argument with Professor Li? I heard you had one,\u201d Bai Yishan inquired.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d Han Sen then went on to tell Bai Yishan what had transpired.\n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d Bai Yishan asked.\n\nHan Sen thought he might as well show Bai Yishan, since an answer wouldn\u2019t be possible.\n\nBai Yishan looked very excited upon being shown what Han Sen had been given. He exclaimed, \u201cLi Singhua is good! That is why he is my number one opponent. This is a very interesting theory.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked confused, and so he asked, \u201cBut there is no solution to this, is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to solve, yes. And it is not just him who has been researching this; many scholars have tried.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan continued talking as he perused the information. He said, \u201cLi Singhua\u2019s thoughts and suggestions make people think. He has inspired me a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t solve it,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cResearch does not require answers. Not everything on this plane of existence can be answered, and that is the beauty of research. There may be incidental results, but they are often viewed as being worth more than the subject itself. This research is comprised of many astounding theories, thoughts, and insights. For him to allow you to see this is brilliant.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan went on to tell Han Sen, \u201cRead this information. If you understand all that is written here, you\u2019d fare well in the prospect of graduating.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He didn\u2019t know why one minor, unsolvable subject such as this would fascinate Bai Yishan so much. Han Sen only now noticed the value of what he had been given.\n\nHan Sen went to read it further, and there was much in there that he did not understand. He had to ask Bai Yishan for clarification.\n\nHan Sen knew Li Singhua didn\u2019t just want to resolve the tensions, he wanted them both to learn more and become better than two squabbling kids in the canteen.\n\n\u201cProfessor Li, you are very kind.\u201d Han Sen often consulted Bai Yishan for clarifications, but there was much even his teacher did not understand.\n\nSurprisingly, Bai Yishan let Han Sen ask Li Singhua himself.\n\n\u201cIs this appropriate?\u201d Han Sen asked. Everyone knew Bai Yishan and Li Singhua were enemies, so this was indeed a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe have disagreements pertaining to the work we both share and love. There is no personal animosity between us. Feel free to ask him whatever you want,\u201d Bai Yishan said."
