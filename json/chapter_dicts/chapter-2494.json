    "text": "The distraught Tianxia Peacock King flapped its wings wildly. It was blazing with rainbow light, and its power ripped haphazardly through the sky, tearing trenches in space wherever it went.\n\nIts efforts were futile, though. Its belly was still expanding. The Tianxia Peacock King kept crying.\n\nHan Sen and the others looked on in dumbfounded silence. Minutes later, the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s belly was bloated like a balloon. And it was still expanding. Its skin was so stretched that it was becoming transparent. Everyone on the white whale began to wonder if the creature\u2019s belly was about to explode.\n\nOf course, the Tianxia Peacock King didn\u2019t disappoint them. Its belly ruptured, and the detonation was like thunder. There was a gaping hole where its belly had once been.\n\nA giant, creamy cloud emerged. It was the black cricket\u2019s fluffy white discharge.\n\n\u201cIt is that strong?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He hadn\u2019t realized that the creamy cloud possessed much power, and he certainly didn\u2019t think it was strong enough to erupt from the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s belly. The peacock was a ridiculously powerful deified creature, and it had just been ripped open like a plastic bag.\n\n\u201cYou have to watch what you eat. The Tianxia Peacock King is a prime example of what happens if you don\u2019t. It swallowed a tasty morsel whole without first inspecting the contents\u2026 Now its belly has blown up. I don\u2019t know if it will survive this.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart leaped. He stopped the white whale and looked at the Tianxia Peacock King.\n\nAfter the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s belly broke, the creature\u2019s rainbow blood was running freely into the clouds. The beast hung in the air, crying hopelessly. It fluttered its wings, wanting to leave the area, but its rainbow godlights were growing dimmer and dimmer. They were becoming difficult to see at all. It wasn\u2019t going to be attacking anything anytime soon.\n\nThe creamy cloud ignored the Tianxia Peacock King and flew back toward Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a good opportunity. Take control of the white whale, Bao\u2019er!\u201d Han Sen said happily. He grabbed the little red bird and ran out of the white whale. He headed toward the severely injured Tianxia Peacock King.\n\n\u201cLittle Red, your time is now!\u201d Han Sen threw the little red bird at the peacock.\n\nThe little red bird screamed sadly as its body turned into that of a fire phoenix. But it followed Han Sen\u2019s instructions and sent a stream of angry fire toward the poor Tianxia Peacock King.\n\nThe flames covered the sky as its whirling inferno moved to incinerate the Tianxia Peacock King. Everything in sight took on a flickering, hellish appearance. The Tianxia Peacock King was already injured and on the brink of death. He was unable to withstand the little red bird\u2019s phoenix flames. The peacock cried as it burned, and it flapped its wings feebly. But sadly, it was simply too injured to move.\n\nIt still had the injuries from its fight with Meng Lie, and now, it had practically exploded. Its guts were falling out. One of its legs was a ruined mess.\n\nIf the Tianxia Peacock King could find a safe place to rest, it would probably recover in a thousand years or so. If it had a powerful treasure or two, it might heal even more quickly.\n\nBut it was in no condition to fight a deified elite right now.\n\nAs the Tianxia Peacock King burned and screamed, its feathers and flesh turned a deep red. It was like a burning bar of iron. But it was struggling and refusing to submit to the cold prospect of death. It wanted to escape the little red bird\u2019s phoenix fires, first and foremost.\n\nSadly, it couldn\u2019t get away. The little red bird continued to chase it and send crackling flames over its body. Its lifeforce had become so weak that the rainbow godlight could no longer be seen.\n\nThe Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s lifeforce was almost depleted, and its wings cease to move. Its body was falling in a raging fire. Han Sen moved up behind the little red bird and shouted, \u201cLet go of the peacock. Let me do it!\u201d\n\nHan Sen lifted his Thunder God Spike. He flew to the Tianxia Peacock King that had lost consciousness and took aim at its brain. With all his might, he tried to crush it.\n\nThe Thunder God Spike struck the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s skull hard, but the weapon couldn\u2019t penetrate it. Even so, silver lightning coursed down into the creature. The electrified Tianxia Peacock King lost consciousness and began to shake violently.\n\nHan Sen kept striking it. The peacock\u2019s body continued to shiver and shake. Han Sen had yet to hear the killing announcement, though.\n\n\u201cThis kill has to be mine. Jade Emperor, Holy Buddha, Bodhi Sativa, you must give me a beast soul!\u201d Han Sen kept smacking the peacock\u2019s head as he prayed.\n\nThe peacock king wasn\u2019t moving. And Han Sen had yet to hear the announcement noise. He gritted his teeth and kept on smacking it.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic deified hunted: Tianxia Peacock King. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Tianxia Peacock King beast soul.\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen wondered if the kill had been claimed by the little red bird, he suddenly heard the announcement. In an instant, Han Sen felt as if he had been transported directly to heaven. The 180,000 pores across his skin felt so good, and he moaned in pleasure.\n\n\u201cDeified beast soul! I got a deified beast soul\u2026\u201d Han Sen grinned like a madman. Turning away from the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s body, he went looking for the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s beast soul to see what type it was.\n\n\u201cA weapon, please give me a weapon. Just a weapon will do\u2026\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart was screaming.\n\nDeified beast soul Tianxia Peacock King: Soul armor type (broken)\n\n\u201cSoul armor type? Holy sh*t! That\u2019s better than a weapon. I\u2019m rich. I\u2019m rich!\u201d Han Sen was so happy that he almost jumped on the spot.\n\nIt was deified soul armor, so it would have a deified-level defense. It also had the power buffs that came along with a deified beast soul. Although it wasn\u2019t like a shapeshifting beast soul, having the deified body buffs would make his attacks as fierce as a deified being\u2019s.\n\nNow that he had this peacock\u2019s soul armor, Han Sen could challenge deified elites in battle.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026 what does \u2018broken\u2019 mean? Is it a broken beast soul? No\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of a broken beast soul before.\u201d When Han Sen saw the word broken at the end of its label, his happy feelings quickly evaporated.\n\nHe summoned the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s soul armor, and a grey garment appeared on his body. It was made entirely out of grey peacock feathers.\n\nTechnically, it seemed less like \u201csoul armor\u201d and more like a \u201csoul robe.\u201d The robe of grey feathers fully enclosed Han Sen. And behind the grey feathers, there was an image of a peacock. It possessed the face of the Tianxia Peacock King. Its feathers were closed, and its tail wasn\u2019t fanned.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. A rainbow godlight was shining within the robe. It formed a silhouette of the peacock with its tail fully fanned. A scary power rose inside Han Sen\u2019s body, and it became a rainbow substance chain that buffed every corner of Han Sen\u2019s being.\n\nFeeling that scary power inside him, Han Sen felt as if he could destroy the entire universe in one punch.\n\n\u201cWeird. The soul robe of the peacock king isn\u2019t broken. It is a perfectly functional set of armor, so why does it say that it is broken?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t understand. He believed that the power currently possessed by the robe was perfectly deified."
