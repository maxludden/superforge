    "text": "Han Sen frowned. He had tried using his Destiny\u2019s Tower to try to claim the other Jade Drum, but it did not work.\n\n\u201cThis is bad. If I am unable to make a sound with the Jade Drum, I will have no choice but to leave it here.\u201d Han Sen felt bad about this, but he was short on time.\n\nQueen had less than a day. If she didn\u2019t register her own Drum in time, she wouldn\u2019t be able to take it with her, even if she did have one willing to follow her. Han Sen had a tight deadline for earning the approval of the Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which Jade Drum accepts me. As long as one of them will make a sound, we can figure the rest out later,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He picked up the white Jade Drum Duke. Then, he gave Bao\u2019er to Huangfu Jing. \u201cTake Bao\u2019er away from me. I am going to hit this Drum. If it works, I don\u2019t want to bring you two any harm.\u201d\n\nHuangfu Jing nodded. Then, she took Bao\u2019er towards the exit.\n\nWhen Huangfu Jing left, Han Sen brought out his Demon Bug Bai Sema. He looked at the white Jade Drum, then straightened his middle finger and his thumb. A gold light appeared.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t rely on using luck to get the Drum to obey, so he would have to rely on brute force. He actually wanted Huangfu Jing to take Bao\u2019er away because he didn\u2019t want to be seen in his Dollar persona.\n\nA coin appeared in his hand. On its surface was the number one. As time passed, the number increased in singular ticks.\n\nTwo\u2026 Three\u2026 Four\u2026 Five\u2026\n\nSaving Money was working, and the number went up. With every jump in number, the force that gathered on the coin was multiplied.\n\nThe white Jade Drum was a Duke. So, Han Sen brought the coin\u2019s power up to the number ten. When that was done, he fired it at the Jade Drum. The coin was unleashed with the force of a meteor, and it hit the Drum hard.\n\nDong!\n\nA strong power made a very loud noise atop the white Jade Drum. The sound washed out of the Drum like a tsunami. When it hit the gold Demon Bug Bai Sema, however, it bounced back.\n\nThe sonic force inside the Bai Sema kept bouncing and rolling around with the echo. It was getting stronger.\n\nHan Sen was inside all that sonic force, but he was not hurt. He had struck the white Jade Drum brutally and gotten its approval. The way he had gone about it was just a little violent, but the white Jade Drum\u2019s power did not hurt him because it had accepted him.\n\nBut after the results of the blow surprised Han Sen. The sonic power inside the Demon Bug Bai Sema was increasing. It reminded Han Sen of White Real\u2019s Echo ability.\n\nHe had once joked that if he had a big bell to trap his enemies, he could use Echo to increase sonic powers in the confined space. The Demon Bug Bai Sema might not have been a bell, but it had been proven to be able to trap an enemy. On top of that, Echo seemed to work inside it.\n\n\u201cI have only been thinking about the Demon Bug Bai Sema\u2019s ability to protect me, and so I\u2019ve been overlooking an incredible opportunity. I should really go back to Sky Palace and learn Echo from White Real. Using Echo and the Jade Drum in combination could work very well,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nThe white Jade Drum, after that manic and violent display, gave its approval to Han Sen. When Han Sen tried to confirm this and hit it again, it was a much simpler affair. By just hitting it lightly, the Drum now made a sound and emitted sonic powers.\n\n\u201cSometimes, violence really does work more than reason.\u201d Han Sen chuckled as he put away the white Jade Drum. Then he looked at the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can take this one with me.\u201d Han Sen brought out a coin and began gathering up power again. When the number ticked its way up to ten, he fired the coin at the Drum.\n\nDong!\n\nThe coin hit the Drum\u2019s surface. A metal noise sounded. He wasn\u2019t able to make it respond with a proper drum sound.\n\nThe coin was stuck to the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, but it wasn\u2019t having any amazing effects. The Drum wasn\u2019t being crushed; not that he wanted that. Han Sen didn\u2019t want the Drum to get damaged, of course.\n\n\u201cReaching the number ten with Saving Money is all I can do. Even if I can take it further, that won\u2019t be much of an increase. It looks like this thing really is King class. My power isn\u2019t enough to make a sound.\u201d Despite his failure, Han Sen wasn\u2019t disappointed. He only wanted to take the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum away with him so he could have the time to claim it in the future.\n\nHan Sen thought for a moment, then cut his finger. He melted his crystal blood and dropped a little onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.\n\nHe saw the blood slowly melted into the scorpion symbol, but still, it took a while to absorb.\n\nBut it actually was absorbing. Although it hadn\u2019t melted completely into the symbol just yet, there was a weird red spot on the scorpion\u2019s back. It didn\u2019t match with the image.\n\n\u201cIf blood is able to melt into it, then I\u2019m sure I will be able to infect it. That would make gaining the Drum\u2019s approval far easier,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He took the two Jade Drums with him as he left the cave. He went looking for Bao\u2019er and Huangfu Jing.\n\nNow that Han Sen had the white Jade Drum\u2019s approval, the three of them could each take a drum and leave.\n\nAfter Han Sen found them, they all headed for the Thousand Treasures base that was located on the planet. He wanted to leave with the Jade Drums as soon as he could.\n\nHan Sen knew that it was exceedingly rare for three people to appear with Jade Drums all at once, and that made him certain that the trip home wouldn\u2019t be a safe one.\n\nHan Sen was not afraid of trouble, of course. If he had been, he wouldn\u2019t have come in the first place. But this wasn\u2019t just any trouble. This had the potential to be Big Trouble. Three Jade Drums might entice many sonic-practicing elites into coming after them. Any enemies that started hunting them would have to be dealt with.\n\nIn the Planet Jade Drum\u2019s base, a half-humanoid and half-snake Ghana King was in the middle of registering his claim on a Gold Drum.\n\nAll the elites standing around were looking jealous of the Ghana King, who was registering the highly-coveted Gold Drum. The Ghana King wasn\u2019t happy with his prize, however. In fact, he looked rather glum.\n\nHis target had been a Jade Drum, but after ten days of searching, he had only managed to find a Gold Drum. That wasn\u2019t what he wanted, and it made him ill.\n\nA beautiful man with butterfly wings walked in front of the Ghana and laughed. \u201cStephen, I see that you found a Gold Drum.\u201d\n\n\u201cSonic Butterfly King, didn\u2019t you just get a Gold Drum, as well?\u201d Stephen looked at his Gold Drum and smiled.\n\nSonic Butterfly King sighed and said, \u201cThis planet still has Jade Drums, but too many people are digging for them. They are being taken faster than they are being birthed. They aren\u2019t easy to find anymore.\u201d"
