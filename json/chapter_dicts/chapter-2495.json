    "text": "Han Sen brought the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s body back to the white whale, and Bao\u2019er quickly whipped out the little gourd and absorbed the cloud inside it.\n\nThe damage done to the white whale was pretty severe. It could repair itself, but being damaged that badly meant it would take a while before it was completely fixed. The ship could hardly move at this point. There were many holes that went clean through the ship, and the entire structure seemed on the verge of falling apart.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, was that really the Holy Area Grass? Might I see it?\u201d Fang Qing Yu asked Han Sen, his eyes gleaming with hope.\n\n\u201cYou know what the Holy Area Grass is?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nFang Qing Yu nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, although I\u2019ve never seen it before. Even in the Thousand Treasures Alliance, there are only a few tales and legends surrounding its existence. The details are scarce, and we don\u2019t even have any pictures of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the Holy Area Grass is something very precious?\u201d Han Sen was so happy.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just precious. Even powerful factions like the Thousand Treasures would like the Holy Area Grass. If this is the real deal, this Holy Area Grass could be exchanged for the ownership of multiple systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the Holy Area Grass used for?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\nSo far, Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen the Holy Area Grass do anything other than attract xenogeneics.\n\nEven if eating it could make you deified, it still wouldn\u2019t have the same value as a few large systems.\n\n\u201cI only know a few legends about it, but I don\u2019t know if they are true. According to the records of the Thousand Treasures Alliance, eating the Holy Area Grass can provide access to a mysterious xenogeneic space known as the Holy Area. There is no sickness or death in that place, and when you enter it, it can make you immortal,\u201d Fang Qing Yu said after a moment of thought.\n\nUpon hearing that, Han Sen was rather disappointed. He knew that claim couldn\u2019t be true.\n\nIf being immortal was so simple, then the Sacred Leader wouldn\u2019t have gone to such lengths in attempting to extend his own life. He wouldn\u2019t have spent so much effort trying to kill a god.\n\nEntering the Holy Area didn\u2019t sound legit to Han Sen. If eating the plant would let him enter some Holy Area, the black cricket would have been there already. Why would it still be here?\n\n\u201cOh no, Bao\u2019er! Get that cloud of your gourd,\u201d Han Sen hastily told Bao\u2019er, thinking about the black cricket.\n\nThe black cricket was still somewhere inside of that fluffy white cloud, and Han Sen didn\u2019t know if it had eaten all the Holy Area Grass.\n\nSo, Bao\u2019er released the cloud. Han Sen approached it and saw that the Holy Area Grass was still there. He brushed the leaves of the Holy Area Grass. He soon discovered that the root of the Holy Area Grass had something ball-shaped on it. There was a tiny hole in the ball-shaped thing. The cricket must have made a house in there.\n\nThe hole looked too small to admit Han Sen\u2019s fingers. He didn\u2019t know how to get the black cricket out of there without hurting the Holy Area Grass.\n\n\u201cBrother Fang, do you think this is the Holy Area Grass?\u201d Han Sen gave the Holy Area Grass to Fang Qing Yu.\n\nFang Qing Yu accepted it and examined it. After a while of observation, he said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much information available in the Thousand Treasures Alliance, but this does look the same as the illustrations that I\u2019ve seen. I cannot be entirely sure, though. If it is the real Holy Area Grass, you are going to have to find a way to hide it. The Holy Area Grass is very attractive to many xenogeneics, and they will do anything to claim it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face looked glum. He didn\u2019t know if this was the Holy Area Grass, but it had already attracted many xenogeneics. It had even attracted deified xenogeneics like the Tianxia Peacock King. Not even Destiny\u2019s Tower had contained its magnetic effect on xenogeneics.\n\n\u201cDaddy, I will help you keep it,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, her eyes closing in a slow blink.\n\n\u201cSure. You take it for now, then.\u201d Han Sen knew Bao\u2019er liked the plant.\n\nHan Sen would never skimp on the resources that he provided to his daughter. Plus, he didn\u2019t know how to deal with the Holy Area Grass for now, so there was no harm in allowing Bao\u2019er to hold onto it for the time being.\n\nBao\u2019er was very happy about this. She put the Holy Area Grass and cloud back inside her little gourd.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, inside the Holy Area Grass is a black cricket. Earlier, it broke the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s belly. You need to be careful with that thing,\u201d Han Sen warned her.\n\n\u201cCrickets are my favorite! I should get another one to make the crickets fight,\u201d Bao\u2019er said happily.\n\n\u201cWhat I mean to say is that the black cricket eats the Holy Area Grass. Don\u2019t let it eat all the Holy Area Grass,\u201d Han Sen said with a wry smile.\n\n\u201cWe need to let him eat it. We can\u2019t eat the grass. It is only useful to us if he eats it,\u201d Bao\u2019er said.\n\n\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d Han Sen asked Bao\u2019er in shock.\n\nBao\u2019er thought and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I do know that if he finishes all the grass, it can take us to a fun place called the Holy Area.\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er must have some sort of prophetic power,\u201d Han Sen thought. He knew Bao\u2019er wouldn\u2019t lie to him, but Bao\u2019er seemed to have the answers to the strangest questions. It was hard to imagine what sort of creature she was.\n\nAlthough the white whale was heavily damaged, they had earned a lot in their most recent adventure. Han Sen had captured the Holy Area Grass and the black cricket. He had also gotten the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s body and the soul robe beast soul. All those items were priceless.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what sort of power Bao\u2019er\u2019s little gourd had. Ever since the Holy Area Grass was sucked inside, though, no further cloud beasts came for them. The Holy Area Grass was no longer connected to the outside world.\n\nHan Sen found a chance to quietly transport the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s body back to the sanctuaries. Right now, Han Sen had no way of consuming the flesh of a deified xenogeneic. So, he had to just store it for the time being.\n\nHan Sen drove the white whale through the rest of the Tianxia System. For a few days, it was smooth sailing and nothing bad happened. They encountered a few King class cloud beasts, which were swiftly killed by Han Sen.\n\nWhenever there was free time, Han Sen kept trying to push The Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel.\n\nThe Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel was the same as the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s. They were separate and not connected to the other universal cogwheels. However, unlike the Blood-Pulse Sutra, it couldn\u2019t connect with other-self cogwheels either. This cogwheel was completely independent. It had no connection to anything else in the universe.\n\nIt was different from the Dongxuan Sutra. The Dongxuan Sutra connected to every cogwheel in the universe. The Story of Genes couldn\u2019t operate with a single other cogwheel.\n\nAccording to most theories, the fewer connections a cogwheel had to others, the easier it was to push. After all, it took power to move every cogwheel, so the more cogwheels that needed to be moved, the more strength was required.\n\nBut with Han Sen\u2019s power, he still couldn\u2019t push the self-cogwheel of The Story of Genes. It was as if the cogwheel was locked up, or maybe it wasn\u2019t supposed to be moved.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Area and noticed that the cogwheel wasn\u2019t big. The white cogwheel also had weird symbols engraved across it. Han Sen realized they were the same as those on Spell\u2019s forehead. They might have meant Eternity."
