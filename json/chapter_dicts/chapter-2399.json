    "text": "\u201cDollar will die!\u201d Dragon One could see that Han Sen was about to be swallowed by the weird insect.\n\nInstead of being sad for Han Sen, he was sad about what Han Sen\u2019s death would mean for all of them. Even Han Sen, who could somehow nullify the air-restriction, couldn\u2019t escape this monster. If Han Sen couldn\u2019t escape, then it likely meant death for them all.\n\nDragon Eight, who was following Dragon One, also saw what was about to happen. He looked just as glum.\n\nBoom!\n\nIn the sky, the insect\u2019s enormous mouth was closing around Han Sen. Its sharp teeth were about to clamp down on Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nDragon One and the others couldn\u2019t bring themselves to look at the horrible sight. They turned their heads and continued running as hard as they could. They hoped they could find a place on Planet Dark Zone that wasn\u2019t smothered by the air-restriction area. That was the only way they might be able to escape this hellhole.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body didn\u2019t break because of the weird insect\u2019s attack, though. He was still in super god spirit mode, so the creature\u2019s incredible power was unable to touch him. While the weird insect\u2019s teeth pierced through his body, they didn\u2019t actually bring him any harm.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was incorporeal now, rather like a ghost\u2019s. He moved effortlessly through the weird insect\u2019s teeth and flesh, and he was on the verge of escaping the creature\u2019s body when he realized that he didn\u2019t want to leave just yet. He turned around, heading deeper into the maw of the weird insect.\n\nThe hard bug shell and flesh couldn\u2019t restrict Han Sen\u2019s movement. He moved quickly through the insect\u2019s entire body.\n\nBut Han Sen found that the inside of the creature was like jade. Even its organs and vessels had taken the texture of xenogeneic genes. There was no weakness to be found anywhere, so it would be hard for Han Sen to hurt the creature from the inside.\n\nBut Han Sen had found the beast\u2019s xenogeneic core located in its brain. It was a green core that shone like the stars.\n\nTime passed. Han Sen\u2019s super god spirit mode could last much longer now that he had reached King class. He couldn\u2019t use it forever, but he could certainly last around half an hour.\n\nStaying close to the green deified core of the beast, Han Sen gathered up power in his hand to perform super spank. Once he built up sufficient power, he moved toward the green core.\n\nBzzt!\n\nThe substance chains went crazy under the impact of Han Sen\u2019s hand. They were like rubber bands that couldn\u2019t be broken.\n\nRoar!\n\nThe weird insect felt a sharp pain in its head, and so it roared. Its body hit the ground, then drilled deep inside. It decided to go for Dragon One.\n\nThe insect snapped up a Destroyed King, plunging through the man\u2019s King area like it wasn\u2019t even there. Blood splattered everywhere. It was like it had eaten a sheep, not a scary King.\n\nDragon One headed for the other side of the planet. He tried using every power at his disposal to fight back, but against that deified insect, all of his powers seemed to be useless.\n\nThe scariest thing about the creature was its King area. If they met an ordinary deified xenogeneic, Dragon One and the others could still make an easy escape.\n\nBut this weird insect\u2019s area power not only restricted air travel, it stopped any powers being used in the atmosphere. Even using skills or items to teleport was impossible. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cRun! Run for your life!\u201d Dragon One and the others used all their various powers to try to escape, but the creature picked them off one by one. In the end, only Dragon One, Dragon Eight, Barr, and Dia Robber were left alive. They were injured, but they were still running.\n\nSomehow, they all started to work together. They knew that if they didn\u2019t, they had no chance of surviving.\n\nThe bodies of Dragon Eight and Barr were special. They were almost immortal. That incredible power allowed them to escape some attacks and continue breathing.\n\nDragon One and Dia Robber were top-tier Kings. They were invincible when it came to fighting others of the King class, but attempting to deal with this scary deified was enough to leave them injured and bleeding.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe weird insect clamped its jaw around Barr\u2019s leg, and Dia Robber took that moment to gather up three different types of power. He created a triangle composed of three different energies. Light blossomed inside that triangle, breaking space and shaking the air around it. The light shot forward, smacking right into the weird insect\u2019s mouth. But the weird insect just swallowed the light, which disappeared harmlessly down its throat.\n\nDia Robber looked pale and hopeless. That was the strongest move he could conjure, but it hadn\u2019t affected the weird insect in the least.\n\nThat insect wasn\u2019t an ordinary deified monster. Its area power and the strength of its body both indicated that whatever it was, this creature was far better than an average deified xenogeneic.\n\nAlthough they hadn\u2019t exhausted all of their strength yet, Dragon One and the others knew that if they could not escape the weird insect\u2019s area, then they were sure to die.\n\n\u201cThis is bad. Why did we randomly encounter a xenogeneic with such a scary area?\u201d Dragon Eight groused loudly as he ran.\n\nDragon One remained silent, though. He knew that complaining would help no one. He needed to last as long as he could, grasping every additional second that he could, in the hope that a miracle might save them. Maybe a new idea would occur to one of them, something that could help.\n\nDia Robber was of a similar mindset. In that place, no one could save them. Even if the deified elites of his race knew they were in danger, deifieds were not permitted access to the universal core area. Only King class beings were allowed to enter this place. You could not be one level higher nor one level lower.\n\n\u201cIf I am to die, I do not want to die fleeing,\u201d Barr snarled with a furious look on his face. He turned around and sprinted towards the weird insect. His body blazed with a sword light.\n\nDia Robber started to stop him. But then he realized that with the situation they were currently in, no matter how hard they ran, they could not run far enough. Stopping Barr was pointless.\n\nBarr slashed the weird insect\u2019s head, but the bone knife never made contact with the weird insect\u2019s shell. The substance chains on its body caught the knife and crushed it.\n\nBarr\u2019s hand touched the substance chains. His arm vanished in a cloud of fleshy scraps.\n\nThe weird insect opened its mouth to chase down the injured Barr. Barr couldn\u2019t run any further, though, and he didn\u2019t want to. He summoned his area power and used his left hand to punch the weird insect\u2019s face.\n\nBarr\u2019s powerful area was as weak as an eggshell before the brute force of the weird insect\u2019s teeth. Barr\u2019s King area shattered, and his body was bitten in half. The bitten section of his body disappeared down the creature\u2019s gullet.\n\nAlthough Barr could respawn and gain strength each time, the process required his cells to be close by. Now that half of his body was swallowed and digested, he could no longer respawn.\n\nThe weird insect swung around, going for what was left of Barr\u2019s body. Barr was still conscious, but the situation was hopeless.\n\nRoar!\n\nAs the weird bug came down to eat the other half of his body, Barr realized he was going to die. But then the bug suddenly squealed. Its body became straight and rigid, like it had been electrified.\n\nBarr and the others froze in place. They weren\u2019t sure what was happening.\n\nBlergh!\n\nThe weird insect opened its mouth, then spewed out dark green blood like a fountain. The blood sprayed all over Barr."
