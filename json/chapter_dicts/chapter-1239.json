In his time away from Han Sen, the silver fox had grown to become a giant, almost wolf-like fox. It had ten electrified fox tails that crackled and sparked with an intensity that looked as if it could tear the dimension apart.\n\nSaint Fan was visibly disturbed when he saw it.\n\nBut Han Sen was exuberantly happy, and rightly so. His companion hadn\u2019t just returned, he had come back with a grand amount of power. The significance of its tails told them it had either opened nine gene locks, or quite possibly, ten.\n\nThe silver fox swung its tail after appearing, as a bolt of lightning was fired towards Saint Fan.\n\nSaint Fan did not want the lightning to touch him, so he swung Han Sen and Xie Qing King together as a meatshield.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe silver lightning hit Han Sen and Xie Qing King, and the looks on their faces were the distorted and wild expectation of a sudden death that was about to strike them.\n\nThey were unable to avoid the lightning, but when they got hit, they noticed it wasn\u2019t a bolt meant to harm them. It healed them. Their relief was immense, and the healing power they received equaled the power of the Holy Rhino at the very least.\n\nWhen the lightning came into contact with Saint Fan\u2019s body, though, the emperor let out a shrill shriek of pure agony. The lightning seared the skin off his entire body and made him smoke.\n\nAt that precise moment, Han Sen and Xie Qing King noticed they had been separated from Saint Fan.\n\nThe lightning attack had left Saint Fan\u2019s body charred and burned, and the wounds looked irreparable. He tried to heal himself, but try as he might, he was unable to.\n\nLittle Silver wasn\u2019t letting up on his master\u2019s aggressor, though. He pumped up the charge and continued frying Saint Fan. In response, the scorched spirit tried to use a white light in defense.\n\nThe powers of the two looked to be equal, and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear who would win.\n\nThe silver fox did not stop casting, and the holy light of Saint Fan\u2019s shield had grown in volume and intensity to equal a small silver sun.\n\nThere was no explosion, but the existence of the greenery around them flickered violently, as if there was a switch that operated time periods. One moment, the greenery would be in full, verdant bloom. The next, a scorched, charred hellscape. It switched between the two rapidly and made for an awe-inducing sight.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s energy felt disturbed as he witnessed this. He wanted nothing more than to leave, feeling dwarfed by the gargantuan forces that battled before him.\n\n\u201cEveryone, focus on felling the remaining spirits and super creatures!\u201d Han Sen called, running into battle against Saint Fan\u2019s army.\n\nNow, Saint Fan had been left to deal with a being that was his equal. He was left to fight with the silver fox, and he couldn\u2019t be distracted. Under the pressure put on him by the electric fox, he wouldn\u2019t have the time to resurrect anything that died.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King laid waste to the remaining forces with ease, all except for the Holy Rhino. But Han Sen thought it odd. Despite what he killed, Han Sen did not receive a single announcement.\n\nThis made him frown. Even if the foes he had routed could be resurrected, death\u2014no matter how temporary\u2014should yield him an announcement of some kind. This must have meant Saint Fan did not resurrect them on the field of battle, and that he must have done something before he came to fight.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a new trick. I wonder what he did, exactly.\u201d Han Sen weighed the mystery in his mind.\n\nBut Han Sen also felt a streak of relief. If Saint Fan truly had the power of resurrecting spirits and creatures, it was almost too frightening a thing to comprehend.\n\nSaint Fan was not invincible in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, despite his immense amount of power. Even he had a limit.\n\nThen, Han Sen suddenly heard the boisterous spirit scream aloud once more. It looked like he had failed to withstand the power of Little Silver\u2019s lightning.\n\n\u201cWhat did Little Silver do to become so strong? He must have eaten more than the nine-tailed fox\u2019s geno essence I let him have. He must have unearthed some fairly nifty treasure,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nBut the silver fox and all the super creatures on Ghost Mountain had all disappeared without a trace, so he thought something fairly more substantial had taken place, as well.\n\nSaint Fan shouted, and turning to look, Han Sen saw a lot of strange light beam right into him.\n\nFrom out of Saint Fan, a snake head, lion body, and spider claws were all beginning to grow.\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cAll these creatures were a part of him already? They didn\u2019t resurrect, they were just birthed by him!\u201d\n\nNow, all the super creatures and king spirits of the field became one with Saint Fan. His body became stronger, and it made Little Silver\u2019s glow look fainter.\n\nThe silver fox looked like he was having a hard time keeping up the constant discharge of electricity.\n\nSaint Fan was becoming more powerful than they thought could be possible, as he grew to encompass a mish-mash of all those different creatures. The silver lightning was no longer enough to keep him at bay.\n\nWater can extinguish fire, but if the fire is too strong, not even water can help."
