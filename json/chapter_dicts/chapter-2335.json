    "text": "Prince Swordstar stared furiously at Han Sen\u2019s back. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince, you are just going to leave like this?\u201d Prince Swordstar\u2019s remaining guard looked angry as he spoke.\n\nPrince Swordstar said coldly, \u201cMy people will not die for nothing. He dared to kill in King\u2019s Garden, and so the blood kirin will die. Let\u2019s go to the sentencing court.\u201d\n\nHan Sen rode the blood kirin to the king tree. In his heart, he was thinking, \u201cThe blood kirin\u2019s desire to kill is way too strong. If he wants to kill, there is nothing I can do to stop him. Fortunately, it was only a guard. I can negotiate and explain his actions.\u201d\n\nAs he got closer and closer to the king tree, Han Sen was unable to find any primary root king dragons. Han Sen kept moving forward.\n\nThe primary root king dragons appeared in different locations each and every time. Han Sen was not lucky today, though. He didn\u2019t run into any of them on his way.\n\nThere were many princes and princesses following him, however. Han Sen mostly ignored their presence, but after a while, he noticed that they had fallen back and stopped following him forward. That was a little concerning.\n\nHan Sen looked around and found that he was close to the king tree. It was so thick, like a giant pillar in front of him. There were one hundred miles of land between him and the tree.\n\nHan Sen could see that there were some wrinkles in the tree\u2019s bark that were as wide as entire valleys. But the king dragons he had seen were not as big as that.\n\nHan Sen slowed down the speed of his approach. This place was quite different than he had imagined. Getting closer to the tree didn\u2019t result in him finding more and more of the primary root king dragons.\n\nHan Sen soon found a king dragon, with a man in a white robe standing before it. Han Sen remembered the information given to him by Mister White, and he quickly recognized the man.\n\nPrince Seventeen, Bai Qing Xia, was known as the prettiest man in the entirety of King\u2019s Kingdom.\n\nThe man was so handsome that his good looks made him practically invincible.\n\nWhile Qing Xia was very handsome, the legends also said that he was quite weak. His mother had been injured while she was pregnant, and her baby had been injured as well. So, he was born damaged. He was a very weak person among the Extreme King, and his body wasn\u2019t like one of the royal bloodline. He was weaker than a commoner.\n\nPrince Qing Xia was very handsome, but he wasn\u2019t good at anything except for being eye candy. He didn\u2019t join the fights for authority. If anyone mentioned him in conversation, it was just to talk about his face.\n\n\u201cBrother Seventeen, what are you doing?\u201d Han Sen rode the blood kirin over to Prince Qing Xia, but the man didn\u2019t respond. Han Sen wanted to know why Prince Seventeen was the only one there, though; all the other royal children were gone.\n\nPrince Qing Xia\u2019s eyes were like stars, and his facial features were sharp. He was like a carving, wrought from a block of marble. But he didn\u2019t look good. In fact, he looked pale and sick.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t expected Han Sen to approach and talk to him. Prince Qing Xia looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cI am here to get protection from King Wen. Aren\u2019t you doing the same, Brother Sixteen?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m just walking around.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think he had come at the right time. He didn\u2019t know what \u201cprotection from King Wen\u201d meant.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is something connected to the Kingese scrawl upon the king leaves, but how will that help him? Is he going to pick a leaf off the king tree?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nPrince Qing Xia smiled and said, \u201cThere is no need to hide since you are here now. If you are strong enough to claim the alpha\u2019s statue, then of course you can gain the protection of King\u2019s Cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want the Kingese, then I should not disturb you. I will continue walking around,\u201d Han Sen said, then readied himself to depart.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t figured out how to get the Kingese, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, he could risk being exposed. He had to get out of there now and figure out the Kingese later.\n\nPrince Qing Xia suddenly jumped. His body teleported in front of Han Sen, barring his departure.\n\n\u201cThe Kingese hasn\u2019t woken up yet. I am curious how you were able to understand the alpha\u2019s statue. Please teach me, Brother Sixteen,\u201d Prince Qing Xia said. Before Han Sen agreed, he threw a slap at Han Sen.\n\nHis fingers were long, and they glowed with light. It was a pretty sight, but somehow, it was still masculine at the same time.\n\nHan Sen saw his slap and noticed how light it was, and how there was no power. But even so, the move felt as if it would be very difficult to predict. Han Sen was shocked by it.\n\n\u201cPeople say Prince Qing Xia is quite weak, and it would be difficult for him to evolve. But now, I do not think those claims are true. His slap is something very special,\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nThe blood kirin sat down and roared. It wanted to jump away, but Han Sen prevented it from doing so.\n\nThere was a rule in the King\u2019s Garden that forbade killing. It was intended to protect princes and princesses only, though. There were options if a guard was killed, but killing a prince wouldn\u2019t just lead to the blood kirin being punished; Han Sen would be, too.\n\nAfter stopping the blood kirin, Han Sen leaped off of the blood kirin\u2019s back and punched towards Prince Qing Xia.\n\nHis fist flew forward in the traditional Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch. He had learned it from the alpha statue. The rest of the Extreme King had only seen the shadow, but Han Sen had watched the alpha statue actually perform the skill.\n\nPang!\n\nThe fist and the palm came against each other. Han Sen and Prince Qing Xia felt their bodies vibrate as they were pushed back. Neither of them gained the upper-hand.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s punch included the Original Water King Body power. Although it was only on the first tier of area powers, it was still quite strong, and Prince Qing Xia could fight against Han Sen as an equal. It seemed as if the rumors of the Prince\u2019s weakened body were not quite accurate.\n\n\u201cExtreme King really does have many elites. I can never underestimate anyone.\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nMany princes and princesses were watching from a distance, and they found themselves surprised again.\n\nBai Yi was well-known for being quite reckless and exceptionally greedy. Bai Qing Xia was known for being very weak and sick. For two princes like that to fight under the king tree was quite weird.\n\nIt might have been an understandable conflict if it took place somewhere else, but the king tree was only a hundred miles away. Both princes were beneath the King\u2019s Cover. Even geniuses like Bai Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang wouldn\u2019t enter that place. And those two princes had.\n\nThe King\u2019s Cover wasn\u2019t a dangerous place, but it had the king tree\u2019s king air blessing. If the king tree gave them its approval, they would earn its protection. They\u2019d be protected by the Kingese.\n\nIf they were not approved, then they would simply stand there and nothing would happen.\n\nMany princes and princesses hoped to earn the protection of the Kingese, but amidst their uncertainty, none wished to try. If they didn\u2019t earn the protection of King\u2019s Cover or have much Kingese, they would be laughed at for being unlucky."
