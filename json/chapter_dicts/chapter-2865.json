    "text": "When Han Sen became butterfly class and his left eye combined with the true god class Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye, he accidentally leveled up.\n\nIt was a shame he failed to achieve true god class. Although his leveling up had failed, the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye absorbed Han Sen\u2019s xenogeneic power. It resulted in a change. It combined with Han Sen\u2019s xenogeneic body, turning his left eye into a true god class existence.\n\nNow, Han Sen\u2019s whole body was mostly butterfly class. Only his left eye was true god class. It was strange. His eye possessed law power. With it combining with Han Sen\u2019s xenogeneic power, it created some sort of mutation. It was a bit different from the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye law power.\n\nHan Sen did not know if his true god left eye could threaten Sky Armor God, but this was a different god to the one in his house. He sensed a very dark black color inside Sky Armor God\u2019s body. It was the color of crime. It was so dark that it was like ink. God only knew how many sins Sky Armor God had committed to have this color.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter if you are a true god or a fake god. I will judge your crimes today.\u201d Han Sen sounded very cold. The white-and-black colors of his eyes exploded.\n\nBzzt!\n\nA black-and-white two-toned beam of light exploded from Han Sen\u2019s eye. It shone on Sky Armor God. The beam of light looked like it was supposed to be there. Sky Armor God did not have any time to react. His entire body was covered by the black-and-white two-toned beam of light. The black beam of light became chains that entangled Sky Armor God\u2019s body. The white beam of light became a book. It was in front of Sky Armor God.\n\nSky Armor God was shocked and angry. He tried his best to get rid of the black chains, but he noticed his entire body had been trapped by a weird power. He was unable to move.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? In the universe, there is a power that can restrict my power. What is this power?\u201d Sky Armor God was shocked.\n\nKatcha! Katcha!\n\nSky Armor God was tangled up by the black chains, so he could not use his power. The bone slices around Han Sen started to fall away. The purple bone slices turned into dust. Han Sen was set free.\n\n\u201cLet me see what crimes Sky Armor God has committed.\u201d Han Sen raised his hands. The white beam of light became an old book that landed on Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen flipped through the pages, but they were empty. There was no law inside them. There also were no scales or counterweights similar to when Han Sen was being judged.\n\nThe moment Han Sen received the book, his brain had many images playing like a movie. They kept flickering in his head. They made Han Sen understand something. \u201cSky Armor God, you have committed serious crimes. You should die.\u201d Han Sen raised his head and wrote down the word \u201cdie\u201d in his book. The book suddenly flew up. The word \u201cdie\u201d started to shine. It became an executioner\u2019s sword that slashed toward Sky Armor God.\n\n\u201cHow dare you, a low-life creature, judge a god like me.\u201d Sky Armor God was furious. Beneath the black chains that bound him, Sky Armor God was unable to move his body.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe executioner\u2019s sword came down. It cut off Sky Armor God\u2019s head, resulting in blood immediately squirting out. The creatures in the universe were frozen. They could not believe what they were seeing. Sky Armor God, who was so powerful earlier, had been simply decapitated like that.\n\nIn Sky Palace, the woman opened her mouth in shock. \u201cI\u2026 Am I hallucinating? Sky Armor God was killed just like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was like law power, but it was somewhat different.\u201d Sky Palace Leader also looked confused.\n\nThe Extreme King were very surprised. Bai Buyi was shocked. \u201cThat power looked like the second leader of the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye, but it was still quite different. It is scarier.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan law power judge a god spirit? If we knew that, we should have let our children and grandchildren learn the second leader\u2019s geno arts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this Dollar? He is too strange. Can he just kill a god spirit like that?\u201d\n\nThe universe was shocked to its core. Ordinary creatures did not know how powerful god spirits were. Only the old antiques knew how scary god spirits were. Every one of them looked surprised.\n\nThe execution ended. The black chains and old white book were gone.\n\nIt did not make Han Sen feel relaxed. He still stared at Sky Armor God\u2019s body. Han Sen saw the body outside of the skeleton armor was melting. Sky Armor God\u2019s body looked like Deep Abyss Knight again. After Han Sen slew Sky Armor God, the announcement he got was for killing a butterfly Deep Abyss Knight. It was not for killing Sky Armor God. Han Sen knew why this was happening. The crime Han Sen saw did not belong to Sky Armor God. It belonged to the true owner of the body, who was Deep Abyss Knight. The law power could only judge Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s body. It was unable to kill Sky Armor God. It made Sky Armor God separate from Deep Abyss Knight. He had become a god spirit with nothing. He left Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s body. Ordinary creatures could only see a purple bone armor rise to the sky. They could not see the purple bone armor with the god spirit Sky Armor God. \u201cDollar, this is not over yet,\u201d Sky Armor God angrily said to Han Sen. He sent the god personality back to Sky Armor God\u2019s temple.\n\nAfter the god spirit and god personality combined with the creatures in the universe, they could not just separate again. He forced it to separate. Because of that, he was damaged. He could no longer fight. One could have said he was in a bad situation. It was worse than when Knife King stole his rib bone.\n\nWithout a universe god body, he could not do anything to the creatures of the universe. Therefore, there was no point in him staying any longer. \u201cIt is not over yet,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. \u201cOnly one of us will live.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not happen to you,\u201d Sky Armor God coldly grunted. He ignored Han Sen. He just wanted to return to Sky Armor God Temple.\n\nHe was no longer able to attack creatures in the universe, but creatures of the universe could not damage him. Thus, Sky Armor God was not worried Han Sen could hurt him.\n\n\u201cDollar, I am going to make you unable to die or live.\u201d Sky Armor God was madly cursing him. He was forced to separate from his universe god body. The damage he incurred was worse than when Knife King stole his rib bone.\n\nUpon thinking of that, Sky Armor God, menacingly looked at Han Sen. He was instantly shocked. Han Sen\u2019s body had a giant, green god spirit. It was holding Sky Radish God Lance. It came before him.\n\n\u201cSky Vine Radish\u2026 No!\u201d Sky Armor God screamed, but he could only shout no. The big green god spirit clutched the Sky Radish God Lance to break his spirit body. The god personality fell. Han Sen took it.\n\n\u201cGod spirit hunted. Found god spirit gene.\u201d\n\nOther creatures were unable to see Sky Armor God and Sky Vine Radish. After seeing Han Sen judge Deep Abyss Knife, a purple bone armor rose from Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s body. It looked like Han Sen threw the green lance and purple bone armor fell from the sky."
