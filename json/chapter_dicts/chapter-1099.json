Those things are useless to me, just use them and be happy.\u201d Han Sen was starting to sweat, as he wasn\u2019t really a cripple.\n\nQueen then looked around her and said, \u201cSo, are you familiar with this area? If you are, draw me a map. Tell me all about the creature hotspots.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had already been on a cartographic trip, so he had several maps ready to provide her. As soon as Queen accepted the maps, her time of rest was over. She marched right out of the shelter.\n\n\u201cWhat a waste of a fine body. Still, she\u2019s got bigger balls than most men.\u201d Han Sen licked his lips.\n\nQueen returned a few days later, having suffered a number of wounds and lesions. She brought with her a mutant deer.\n\nQueen knew Han Sen must have been very powerful to possess so many beast souls, so she didn\u2019t bother bringing back the carcasses of any ordinary or primitive creatures.\n\nHan Sen knew Queen\u2019s fitness wasn\u2019t too high, though, so he was impressed at her bringing-down of a mutant creature.\n\nHan Sen had maxed out his mutant geno points already, but he still accepted it to show appreciation.\n\nQueen returned to the Alliance to heal, after that. When she was fit as a fiddle, she came back to the sanctuary and went off on another hunt. Each hunting trip would end up longer than the last, and each return would have her in a worse condition.\n\nSometimes, when Queen returned to the shelter, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t be there. So, she\u2019d leave the creatures in the shelter waiting for him. She would then send Han Sen a blank message. If he replied, though, she wouldn\u2019t do the same.\n\nHan Sen returned to the sanctuary after a time away. When he arrived, Queen was gone. \u201cWhy is she working so hard on my behalf?\u201d Han Sen really admired her.\n\nA month passed, and because Queen hadn\u2019t signed up at the shelter, Han Sen won first place. His entry into Divinity\u2019s Bout was confirmed.\n\nQueen had been gone two days at this point, so he had no clue when she\u2019d return.\n\nWhen Divinity\u2019s Bout started, Han Sen donned a suit of armor and went straight to the Martial Hall. Then he proceeded to the battle area.\n\nSpirits were everywhere. It was to be expected, though. Spirits were the dominant species of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. No other human would show up.\n\nHan Sen hid his energy flow, so no one could tell whether he was a human or a spirit.\n\nHan Sen checked out the match list to see what was in store. He hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet, but if he was able to go up against a weak spirit, he wagered he\u2019d be fine.\n\nWhat he saw disappointed him, though. He was first going to go up against Fei Yu King. It must have been a powerful spirit.\n\nUsing super king spirit mode would be pointless here, as it\u2019d render him weak. He\u2019d most likely win the fight, but he\u2019d be spent, and he\u2019d be unable to take part in the next. To hit the top ten of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary\u2019s Divinity\u2019s Bout, he could not use it.\n\nHan Sen decided to not participate and planned to just sit and spectate the fights instead.\n\n\u201cFei Yu, your opponent is called Dollar. Weird, huh? That can\u2019t be a human, can it?\u201d Han Sen heard this while he looked for a seat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d Fei Yu King responded. \u201cIt\u2019s probably some trolling spirit who couldn\u2019t even be bothered to spell out his title in full.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. If it was a human, it\u2019d be a human with a death wish,\u201d the other spirit said.\n\n\u201cI wish it was a human, though. They are sad and pathetic creatures. Last weekend was wonderful; I spent some time torturing a few humans to death. Their screams were a delight!\u201d Fei Yu King spoke with no certain tone or display of emotion. He spoke as if it was just an ordinary chat, and something common to say.\n\n\u201cHaha, you are a king spirit. Of course you would think they are weak. They have no principles, though, I\u2019ll give you that. They\u2019re comparable to dogs, and mangy as they can be, too. Put out your hand without striking them, and they\u2019ll think you\u2019re giving them a treat.\u201d\n\nMany nearby spirits joined in with their talk, all saying horrible things to put-down humans.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face turned green with their wretched speech. Learning how they treated humans, and for what pitiful reasons they\u2019d happily kill them, Han Sen was fuming.\n\nSpirits were able to respawn, so they had no idea of the fear humans felt when it came to the possibility of death.\n\nHan Sen looked at Fei Yu King. He didn\u2019t know which humans he had gleefully tortured and murdered, but he was angry nonetheless. He felt his chest want to explode with the sudden hatred he felt for the spirit.\n\n\u201cFei Yu King, huh?\u201d Han Sen could use super king spirit mode to participate in one fight. If he was to use it on the murderous spirit, that would make him happy enough.\n\nIn human shelters, the fights were streamed through the Martial Hall. No one expected another human to fight, let alone become a Son of God. Those who watched merely wanted to spectate how spirits battled each other. Their fights were usually quite the spectacle.\n\nSu Xiaoqiao was currently in Trench Shelter. He paced around the Martial Monument, looking to see if he could find the name he most wanted to.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Someone\u2019s vision had been blocked by his scurrying.\n\n\u201cI am looking for Dollar,\u201d Su Xiaoqiao responded, as he looked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d join a fight like this. There are far too many king spirits there\u2026\u201d the person said.\n\n\u201cI found it!\u201d Su Xiaoqiao exclaimed with feverish excitement."
