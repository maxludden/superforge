    "text": "Wang Mengmeng watched what was happening with eyes widened. It felt like riding a roller coaster, but this experience was more horrifying than any roller coaster.\n\nShe was lying on the back of Han Sen, and had the same angle of view as him. She watched all his movements, dodging, turning, wielding, charging.\n\nSeeing the endless horned sand foxes sweeping toward them and then the deaths of all of them, she felt that Han Sen was like a killing machine, his movements extremely swift and each attack harvesting a life.\n\nBoth mutant horned sand foxes and primitive ones were killed with one blow each, without exception.\n\nWang Mengmeng and Han Sen were soaked in blood, and the original color of their armor could no longer be discerned. Even the long blonde hair of fairy queen turned red and was dripping blood.\n\nWang Mengmeng suddenly had a strange feeling. Everything seemed surreal to her, as if she was watching a movie about a gorgeous killing spree.\n\nHan Sen was like a tireless killing machine. All her fear went away when she knew he could kill all of the foxes if he had to.\n\nWhat Han Sen saw now was different from what average humans saw. All the movements of the horned sand foxes had become so slow that he could see every single move of them. In his eyes, even the mutant ones were as slow as a grandpa, inviting one\u2019s help.\n\nHan Sen finally understood the best feature of fairy queen. When he shapeshifted into fairy queen, his great ability to predict was enhanced. Now he could hit anywhere he wanted.\n\n\"Too slow.\" Han Sen was even dissatisfied with the speed of the horned sand foxes, because they could not keep up with the speed of the slaughter.\n\n\"I hope there will be more of them,\" Han Sen even thought.\n\nBut Han Sen's reason was telling him that they should run as fast as they could, because shapeshifting could not last forever. Once his body could no longer bear it, he would have to turn into himself and even if he used wings then and saved Wang, Su Xiaoqiao and the rest would die.\n\n\"Must get out before shapeshifting time limit is up,\" Han Sen thought to himself, wielding the lancets even faster.\n\nThe rest of the team were stunned. They had never seen Han Sen fighting in a melee. They had always believed he was a good archer and did not like to place himself under any danger.\n\nBut when they saw Han Sen put down his bow and arrow, they came to know how fearsome he could be in a melee.\n\nMutant horned sand fox was also killed in just one blow. They had never seen Han Sen miss so far.\n\n\"Formidable!\" Even they could not help but shudder. Such efficiency in killing was simply a spree, so terrifying and satisfying to watch that it made one want to moan.\n\nThe sacred-blood horned sand fox howled again and the mutant foxes retreated, while primitive foxes rushed to them faster.\n\nJust in a moment, Han Sen knew what the sacred-blood fox king wanted. It was trying to use the primitive horned sand foxes to consume his shapeshifting time as it was aware shapeshifting did not last long. It wanted to launch strikes at them when his shapeshifting time was up.\n\n\"Cunning beast,\" cursed Gambler. His jambiyas slit another primitive horned sofa fox\u2019s throat, making it fall to the ground, twitching in pain.\n\nHan Sen looked at the sacred-blood fox king and his eyes darkened. The lancets disappeared in his sleeves and a black horn bow appeared in his hands.\n\nThe black stinger arrow was nocked and pointed at the fox king on top of the dune.\n\n\"It\u2019s too far away. Can the arrow reach there?\" Su Xiaoqiao checked the distance between them and the fox king. It was indeed too far. It looked so small from here, so it should be about 1.5 miles away.\n\nWith such a distance, even if Han Sen\u2019s arrow could get there, it would be languid by then. And how can that kill a sacred-blood creature?\n\nThe fox king seemed to share Su\u2019s thought, standing there still and gazing at Han Sen with a trace of mockery.\n\n\"Damn, that sacred-blood fox king is kind of evil,\" Gambler cried when he saw the look of the fox king.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s hands were steady. The arrow suddenly turned into a black shadow flying across the sky toward the insolent fox king.\n\nThe sacred-blood fox king was too intelligent to believe the arrow could actually hurt it, and did not mean to dodge.\n\nIf his arrow had that kind of power, then he should have used it before the fox king led Wang Mengmeng into the ambush.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nBut soon the fox king panicked as it discovered that the speed of the arrow got even higher when approaching itself.\n\nWhen the fox king eventually lost its grace and wanted to run, it was a bit late. Although it leaped as high as it could, trying to dodge the arrow, the arrow still dug into the muscles of its foreleg like a snake.\n\nBlood splashed and its scream rang.\n\nThe arrogant and sly fox king was knocked out by the arrow and tumbled down the dune.\n\nHearing the scream of their king, the skulk of foxes paused their attack and looked to the dune where the king was standing.\n\nOf course, they did not see it because it had fallen. The skulk was suddenly in a chaos and did not know what to do.\n\n\"Hurry,\" commanded Han Sen and dashed."
