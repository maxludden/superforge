Veiling himself in a cloak of silver lightning, Han Sen proceeded forward as the blue lightning cowered away from him.\n\nThe hole was the perfect size for one person to go through. As he felt his way through, it was practically a tunnel, complete with its own twists and turns. After traversing as far as he could, he eventually reached the bottom. There was nothing particularly special about the way he had gone, and it was just as he had seen it from the outside.\n\nInside the stone was a semi-circular space, and each hole had an exit point that led into that place. Han Sen saw a small tree inside, growing in a pot.\n\nThe tree was thirty centimeters tall, and it looked like a small coconut tree. The strangest thing about it was that the tree seemed to have been forged from actual electricity or lightning. Its appearance was not too dissimilar to that of a plasma ball.\n\nThere were three blue fruits growing on the electric branches of the tree, but weirdly, each fruit had something within it. The three lightning fruit each held something different. The highest of the trio had a knight in armor sitting inside as blue lightning flickered around him.\n\nThe knight was wearing armor and a helmet, though, so Han Sen could not see its face. He could not even see its eyes.\n\nThe left fruit had a hammer inside it. Its shape was fairly unremarkable, and it looked like an average blacksmith\u2019s hammer, aside from the blue lightning that crackled around the head. It also had the symbol of lightning forged on it.\n\nThe right fruit had a hand. It was white and pristine, with beautiful, untarnished nails.\n\nIn the palm of the hand was another lightning symbol.\n\nHan Sen felt strange as he looked upon them. The plant was growing three wholly different items.\n\nThe fruits were not yet mature, but the lifeforces of the tree and its fruit were frighteningly powerful. There was no doubt in Han Sen\u2019s mind that he had stumbled across treasure belonging to an emperor spirit.\n\nBut if they were geno weapons, why would a knight and a hand be growing inside the fruits?\n\nThey could have been creatures, but the idea of a creature that had the form of a hammer was bewildering.\n\nHan Sen might not have been able to tell what they were right now, but whatever would come from them had to be good. There was a reason why Thunder Hell Emperor had gone to such great lengths to hide the tree beneath a well submerged in Sky Pure Water.\n\n\u201cWhatever these are, they\u2019ll be awesome when they\u2019re mature. I should help boost its growth; you can\u2019t find an emperor plant every day, after all.\u201d Han Sen summoned his black crystal and bestowed a number of drops upon the tree.\n\nHe examined the fruit the fruit one last time, and he got giddy as he wondered how good the items would be.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re beast souls, that\u2019d be terrific. Imagine if they were berserk super class!\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen decided to summon Dragon King. He was a knowledgeable fellow on a great number of subjects, so there was a chance he could shed some more light on what was growing on the tree.\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King, seeing the mini tree, looked shocked. He went around it to observe it carefully, saying, \u201cHow very peculiar. This should be a lightning emperor geno plant, correct? It is strange how the things inside don\u2019t look very\u2026 electric.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me? The stuff inside isn\u2019t lightning?\u201d Han Sen frowned in a pause, before continuing on to say, \u201cYou must be mistaken. You are, aren\u2019t you? The items inside even have the symbol of lightning emblazoned across them.\u201d\n\nDragon King explained, \u201cI have hundreds of thousands of years of experience. Trust me, I am not mistaken when I tell you that whatever is inside that tree is not lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, can you explain?\u201d Han Sen asked, frowning.\n\nDragon King looked at the fruit and said, \u201cI can\u2019t be sure about the hand and the hammer, but I know for sure everything you\u2019d need to know about the knight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, go on; I\u2019m listening.\u201d Han Sen gestured for him to proceed.\n\nDragon King laughed and said, \u201cI used to grow those. It\u2019s a super beast soul, and it goes by the name Twin Knight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwin Knight? But there is only one of them!\u201d Han Sen found it hard to believe they were twins.\n\n\u201cBefore you spirits sign a contract with humans, you can\u2019t use beast souls. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King balked and said, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t for me. It was for my man, Dragon Knight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon Knight? You had someone to ride you?\u201d Han Sen looked at Dragon King with shock.\n\nDragon King\u2019s face turned green, and he explained, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that! Dragon Knights are knights with dragon blood. They are powerful super creatures, actually; not too far off your Disloyal Knight. I had a whole battalion of them, at one point.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had a whole battalion to ride you? You are good.\u201d Han Sen laughed and went on to say, \u201cAnyway, keep going. What is the Twin Knight?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Twin Knight beast soul should grow on the Twin Tree. I had them, and I was going to use a Twin Knight to combine with my favorite Dragon Knight, so he could act as a leader. But something went wrong with the tree and it died; you know how it goes. But I am telling you, this is identical to my Twin Knight. And believe me, I am as perplexed as you about why it is growing on a lightning tree.\u201d Dragon King looked genuinely confused.\n\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what it does,\u201d Han Sen said, looking directly at him.\n\nDragon King laughed and said, \u201cOh, that is simple! It can possess other knights and have powers opposite to what it currently has.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean if a knight has a fire element, and it is possessed, it will instead use an ice element?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cNo. It is extra; as in, you can use ice and fire together,\u201d Dragon King explained.\n\nHan Sen was delighted with the treasure he had stumbled across. He thought that item would be a terrific gain for him. If Disloyal Knight used it, he wondered, what would his powers become?"
