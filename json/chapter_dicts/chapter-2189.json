    "text": "The little toads gathered around him, and they seemed to think he was one of them. The thought made Han Sen\u2019s heart sink, though, and he found himself thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not some dirty toad!\u201d\n\nAfter that day, Han Sen continued coming back to absorb cold and moon powers twice every month. He didn\u2019t need the Cold Palace guardian tablet anymore, and the big toad allowed him to follow the toad family to the waterfall. He was able to absorb the moon powers right next to the deified toad.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Jadeskin grew stronger far faster. Han Sen initially thought it might need another year to reach Duke rank, but it was on the precipice of that change already. He believed that if he continued this steady absorption of cold and moon powers, he\u2019d make it to Duke in three months.\n\nWhen Jadeskin did become Duke, though, he\u2019d have to track down a source of high-quality resources for himself. He couldn\u2019t rely solely on Planet Eclipse.\n\nIt was a good place for early practice, but he couldn\u2019t develop fully if he remained stuck there.\n\nOn that fifteenth of the month, when Han Sen was done guarding the door, he planned to leave Planet Blade and return to Planet Eclipse. But when he reached Yisha\u2019s palace, two Rebate butlers approached, alongside Snowbird Duke.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, Moon Wheel King is looking for you. Please follow us to Full Moon Hall,\u201d said a butler, his face expressionless.\n\n\u201cWhy is Moon Wheel King looking for me?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nFull Moon Palace was a place to hold discussions. Only the Kings of Narrow Moon were allowed to debate there. It was very rare for Moon Wheel King to summon a Marquise for an audience in Full Moon Hall.\n\n\u201cYou will know when you get there, won\u2019t you?\u201d another butler said coldly.\n\nHan Sen looked at Snowbird Duke. She was behaving strangely, holding herself a little more rigidly than usual. He did not say anything, but he just nodded to her.\n\n\u201cMoon Wheel King and the other Kings are waiting for you. Let\u2019s go,\u201d the butler told him, apparently in a rush.\n\nHan Sen followed them to Full Moon Hall. On the ship there, Han Sen got to thinking, \u201cSomething bad must have happened to Yisha. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be called to the Full Moon Office. If something has happened to her, then my days here will be over. Things might be coming to an end.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew that the only other person of rank in Narrow Moon who liked him was Black-Moon King.\n\nThe other Kings were not very keen on him, despite being Yisha\u2019s student. After all, Han Sen was not one of the Rebate. And he had consumed many of their resources. He was just fortunate that the Rebate didn\u2019t flat-out hate him.\n\nIf Han Sen had been able to practice really quickly, perhaps the Kings would have viewed him differently. However, leveling up took Han Sen an excruciatingly long time. They did not think Han Sen would ever reach King, let alone become deified. This was one of the primary reasons they didn\u2019t think too highly of him.\n\nTo them, his guardianship was just another example of his deficiency. If the post had been given to another talented Marquise, that person would definitely have become a Duke after so much time. No change had been observed with Han Sen, though. No change for him meant no gain for them.\n\nHan Sen was backed by Yisha, but if she was gone, then the Rebate wouldn\u2019t waste more resources on an outsider like him.\n\n\u201cThe Rebate is too small of a faction. It is a higher race that used to be a slave race. They aren\u2019t selfless, either. Only Yisha was willing to help me. What a shame this is!\u201d Han Sen vented silently. He knew what was going to happen on this trip.\n\nWhen Han Sen reached the Full Moon Office, everyone was sitting around a large table within.\n\nAlmost all of the Narrow Moon Kings were present. Moon Wheel King was in the middle. Black-Moon King, Shadow King, Flower King, Night River King, and the other Kings sat next to him. The table resembled a half-moon, and as Han Sen walked in, they all turned their attention to him.\n\n\u201cGreetings to all the Kings.\u201d After Han Sen bowed to each of them, he stood where he was without displaying any emotions.\n\nMoon Wheel King sighed and told Han Sen, \u201cYesterday, the Extreme King delivered some news to us. Your teacher, on her venture into the chaos system, was killed. Not even her bones remain. We are going to build a mausoleum in her honor. You were her only student, and so there are many things we must now do together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do whatever I am able to. May I ask how my master was killed?\u201d Han Sen bowed, feeling very strange about this.\n\nIn truth, Yisha was Han Sen\u2019s enemy. He had only become her student as a pretense, and Yisha seemed to have accepted him as a student for reasons of her own, not because she was being altruistic.\n\nBut in all the time they had spent together, Yisha had treated him nicely. She had provided him with many opportunities. Without those opportunities, He might have spent ten years wandering around, and he wouldn\u2019t have achieved half of what he had right now.\n\nSo, his feelings towards Yisha were very conflicted. Hearing she had died, an odd pang rolled through him. He didn\u2019t really know what he was feeling.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Extreme King ambassador, she joined the siege against a deified xenogeneic. She was swallowed by it, and so nothing of her remains,\u201d Moon Wheel King said with a sigh.\n\nMoon Wheel King\u2019s sigh was not fake. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for the Rebate to raise a half-deified warrior. And Yisha had been their best hope of gaining a fully deified Rebate.\n\nLosing Yisha was a big blow to their race.\n\nIf Yisha had not gone to the Extreme King, though, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to become deified by herself. If she remained in Narrow Moon, she\u2019d have been half-deified forever.\n\nFor someone like Yisha, stopping there would have been worse than death.\n\nHan Sen stayed silent after hearing about her death. Being killed by a deified xenogeneic, without so much as a bone being left behind, was something of a clean way to go out. That was very much like her own style.\n\nWhen Moon Wheel King lapsed into silence, Night River spoke. \u201cAfter sorting out Knife Queen\u2019s mausoleum, there will still be some things I will need you to do. You are her only student, so there are some legacy matters and items you will have to take over. I will confirm them, and later give them to you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew that this was the primary point. He didn\u2019t know how much of a legacy the Rebate would be willing to leave him with.\n\nHan Sen was afraid he wouldn\u2019t have a say in these matters. Night River King surely didn\u2019t want to give him anything, and it was definitely going to be a one-sided decision.\n\nHan Sen had expected this, though, so he didn\u2019t say anything. He listened to what he was told, and then he left Full Moon Office. He went to sort out her funeral arrangements.\n\n\u201cThe Extreme King have sent the reward she was owed for the fight. It should be given to Han Sen\u2026\u201d Black-Moon King said, but before he could finish, Night River King interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHan Sen isn\u2019t one of the Rebate, have you forgotten? He isn\u2019t qualified to accept it. We have discussed this already. Say no more,\u201d Night River King said firmly."
