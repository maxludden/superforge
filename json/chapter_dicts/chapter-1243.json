Immediately, she leaped into Han Sen\u2019s chest, loudly proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m thirsty!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and get you some water,\u201d Han Sen said, heading for the water dispenser.\n\nBao\u2019er then stroked Han Sen\u2019s head fondly, whispering to him, \u201cI want ice cream, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Han Sen knew what she wanted before she even said it. There was no way Bao\u2019er would hang around waiting for him if she only wanted water.\n\nHan Sen went to the Sapphire Ice Cream Store. She wouldn\u2019t eat ordinary ice cream, only the expensive homemade ones produced there. Fortunately, Han Sen had a lot of money, so it wasn\u2019t a strain for him to purchase her ice cream every now and again.\n\nHan Sen saw Han Yan on the street on the way there, as she had recently enlisted at the Blackhark Military Academy. Although she been invited to join many other, better academies, she had rejected them all.\n\nHan Yan had her mother\u2019s appearance, but because she had been practicing the Falsified-Sky Sutra, she carried herself with a unique aura.\n\nOthers would believe she looked incredibly holy, but to Han Sen, that was nothing new and he was used to it.\n\nThere was a distance between them, and Han Sen couldn\u2019t get to her quickly. When he eventually got close enough to bark a greeting, he saw a lot of young people around her playing instruments.\n\nThere was a handsome guy playing a guitar at the center, serenading. He was singing about her, and the music was obviously being played for her as well. Han Yan was walking as this occurred, and it was almost as if the others were chasing her with the music.\n\nWhen the song was over, the boy put his guitar away and raced ahead to kneel in front of her. Then, he presented her a bouquet of roses. \u201cHan Yan, I am very fond of you. Would you please be my girlfriend?\u201d\n\nThe other guys were chattering amongst themselves, in hushed chants that whispered, \u201cSay yes! Say yes!\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt very angry, watching this. Now he could understand what Ji Ruozhen had spoken about in his speech.\n\n\u201cThat cheap *sshole! Using cheap flowers to try to seduce my sister. I\u2019m going to beat him up!\u201d Han Sen was still a distance away, so he wished to fly over. Not being able to right now, though, he opted for the next best thing. He started to cross the railing, to get there sooner.\n\nHe knew it was illegal to do that, and he\u2019d be forced to study the traffic laws for ten days if caught, but that was the least of his concerns for now.\n\nWhen just one of the legs crossed the railing, Han Yan took the flowers in her hands.\n\nThe anger that had been simmering inside Han Sen began to boil and swell, and he said to himself, \u201cI treat you like a princess! I take you everywhere you want and give you whatever you want, how can you be tricked with just a few measly flowers?!\u201d\n\nEveryone around was clapping, and then the boy moved in for a hug.\n\n\u201cYou dare? You dare?!\u201d Han Sen was fuming with rage, by this point.\n\nBut Han Yan then extended her arms forward, with the bouquet of flowers resting across the palms of her hands.\n\nHan Yan smiled and said, \u201cThe flowers are beautiful, but I want a boyfriend who is a good man. I want a man who can display his love and affection without the need for something material to represent it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are noble, and I am going to max out my geno points. I will become a demi-god, one day!\u201d the boy hastily replied.\n\nHan Yan said, \u201cRich or poor, strong or feeble, that does not matter to me. Only if you are a good man, will I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell me, what makes a good man?\u201d The guy asked.\n\nHan Yan answered, \u201cIt is simple, and all the requirements and standards I seek reside in the one person I myself admire the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, and who is that?\u201d the boy asked.\n\nAll the boys listened in, as they all secretly wished to make her theirs, too.\n\nHearing Han Yan say she did not want money confused them. So, they each paid extra attention to learn what it would take to make them suitable suitors.\n\nHan Yan smiled and said, \u201cIt is my brother. If anyone can beat my brother as a person, then they are a good man. And such good men are men I would have no qualms dating.\u201d\n\nThey all knew who her big brother was. He was the fearless conqueror of an emperor class shelter in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. Acknowledging such crazy requirements, they all felt hopeless.\n\n\u201cDo you mind if I keep the flowers?\u201d Han Yan asked.\n\nThe boy, startled from out of his daze, swiftly raised his sunken head and said, \u201cOf course, they are for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Han Yan took the flowers and then left.\n\nHan Sen brought his leg back after witnessing all this, and he did so with great joy.\n\n\u201cAlliance traffic law violation detected. You are in breach of law 6385, in an attempt of crossing the rail. Punishment requires a supervised study of the traffic laws for the duration of twenty-four hours. Follow the navigation beacons that will lead you to the traffic department.\u201d The computer near the railing notified Han Sen.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen did not cross the rail completely. If he had, he\u2019d be locked up in study for ten days. Not even the president could get out of a jam like that.\n\nHe had to start his study in three days, so he decided to carry on with his current objective, and that was to take Bao\u2019er to the ice cream store.\n\nWhen Han Sen crossed the bridge, he saw someone approach. Seeing this person, he was flabbergasted."
