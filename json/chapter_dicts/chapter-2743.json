    "text": "He had been trying his best to fight off the sad mind, so he had only experienced the surface of the emotion. Now that he was letting himself go and allowing his mind to freefall into the sad mind, however, he could understand it at a deeper level.\n\nBut the price he had to pay for that understanding was quite scary. In mere moments, suicidal impulses had passed through Han Sen six times.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t succeed this time, I\u2019m afraid I will really end up killing myself,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. But he didn\u2019t hesitate. He let go of his body and allowed the sad will to overtake him.\n\nThrough the ages, many Very High had triggered the eye mark, and most of them started off like Han Sen. They chose to fight against the overwhelming sadness.\n\nEveryone knew that experiencing that level of depression was dangerous. The emotions of sadness ran way too deep, and anyone who experienced it for too long had a high chance of killing themselves.\n\nEven if someone was willing to completely let themselves go and learn all they could about the sad mind, there were limits. When they felt their wills grow weaker and the thoughts of suicide started to come out in full force, they would turn away and stop trying.\n\nThe Very High that studied the Very High Sense were smarter. Rather than seeing the emotional dead ends ahead, they would press on until the end. They would find another way to get out of the emotional darkness.\n\nBut Han Sen was different. He was a very stubborn man, and there was no way for him to retreat. He wasn\u2019t like the Very High who studied the Very High Sense. Even if they didn\u2019t continue, they still had a chance of escaping with only a small amount of damage incurred.\n\nNow, Han Sen would have to walk the full path. Even though he was fighting for his life with every moment that passed, he had to understand the real mind of the Very High elder.\n\nThe sad mind sank deeper and deeper into his own mind. Han Sen learned more and more.\n\nHan Sen never thought that such a pure sea of sadness could exist in the universe. It wasn\u2019t self-loathing or hatred of everything else in existence. Rather, it was a sadness that was more like mercy.\n\nWhen that realization flashed through Han Sen\u2019s mind, he jerked in surprise. Mercy for sadness. He had never thought of this before, but at this moment, he truly felt it. His whole body was overtaken by merciful sadness.\n\n\u201cThese are the last tears I will shed in this universe.\u201d In that infinite sadness, Han Sen heard a sound come from the nothingness.\n\nThat sound was too dynamic to describe. Once he heard it, Han Sen\u2019s chest ached more deeply than he ever could have imagined. He wanted to drop to the ground and weep.\n\nBut he knew that his tears of blood had almost run dry, and he couldn\u2019t cry anymore. After hearing the empty voice in his brain, Han Sen felt even sadder. This was a different kind of sadness than he had felt before, though. This sadness also made him feel helpless and lonely.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen\u2019s heart was stricken with absolute fear. That was because he discovered that his sadness wasn\u2019t coming from the Very High eye mark. It came from himself. It was a paralyzing emotion, and it made him feel like he had lost the most important thing in his life. It felt like there was no point in living. He couldn\u2019t wait to kill himself.\n\nHan Sen slowly realized what was happening, but he couldn\u2019t control it. He felt more and more hopeless and lonely. He slowly raised his hand, ready to crush his own skull and kill himself.\n\nA dozen of the Very High gathered near the Ancient Wall could see that the sadness Han Sen was fighting had intensified. They knew it was a bad sign. Li Keer and Exquisite were in rough shape, as well.\n\n\u201cOh no! Han Sen has stopped resisting. The sad mind has overtaken his body.\u201d The Ninth Uncle\u2019s expression became grave.\n\nThere was no need for him to say that, though. The others could tell what was going on.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Exquisite believed in him so much. He\u2019s going to give up so soon?\u201d a Very High said angrily.\n\n\u201cYou must consider that he is only an outsider, after all,\u201d someone said with a sigh.\n\nThe Very High who practiced the Very High Sense quietly looked at Han Sen and Exquisite. They were waiting for the moment to arrive. The Ninth Uncle was prepared. When that moment came, he would sever Li Keer and Exquisite\u2019s contract with Han Sen. He would rather they be injured than killed.\n\nIndeed, not long after, what everyone expected finally happened. Han Sen raised his hands and moved them close to his head. Everyone could tell he wanted to kill himself due to the influence of the sad mind.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Li Keer and Exquisite raised their hands just like Han Sen had. They touched their foreheads, their faces utterly devoid of hope.\n\nThe Ninth Uncle shook his head. He knew they had reached a point of no return. There was no reason to wait any longer. Han Sen was going to die, and Li Keer and Exquisite had to be saved.\n\nThe Very High didn\u2019t have a large population. There were only a few hundred of them. They couldn\u2019t afford to lose two people.\n\nThe Ninth Uncle raised his hands and summoned the power he would need to forcefully remove the contract binding Li Keer and Exquisite to Han Sen. Then he cocked his head to the side and looked at Han Sen.\n\nEveryone was waiting expectantly for the Ninth Uncle to save Exquisite and Li Keer. They were all looking at him, and they immediately noticed his strange expression.\n\nWhen they followed his gaze, they quickly realized that the Ninth Uncle was staring at Han Sen, and that Han Sen seemed a little different than he had been before.\n\nHan Sen had raised his hand to kill himself, and his face had been full of the emotions of death. Now, his features showed that he was locked in an internal struggle. His hands were stopped halfway. He hadn\u2019t struck himself. There was something deeply disturbing about his expression.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer were affected by Han Sen\u2019s emotions. Their hands had also stopped in midair. They were all frozen in place with faces full of conflict.\n\n\u201cStill struggling,\u201d the Ninth Uncle murmured to himself.\n\n\u201cUncle Nine, stop hesitating. No matter how much that silkworm struggles, he cannot withstand the strength of that sad mind. He is going to die, no matter what. Hurry up and disconnect the contract binding him, Li Keer, and Exquisite.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. His death is inevitable. Hurry up and bring all this to an end. If Exquisite and Li Keer experience his suicide through their connection, it will be very traumatic for them. It will deal a lot of damage to their minds.\u201d\n\nAs everyone discussed this, something weird suddenly happened to Han Sen."
