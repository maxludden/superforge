Her eyes were wide open as she looked at him. She made sure to make herself appear extra pitiable.\n\nHer face looked like she was starving, and she had a lack of clothes. It was like she was abused. It made others want to take pity on her and cry when they heard the stories she told. The corners of the old man\u2019s eyes twitched. A half a day ago, Bao\u2019er ate the most expensive meal in the most expensive restaurant and had emptied his wallet of every penny it contained. Even he was starting to believe it. He wanted to smack his mouth and curse himself for being useless. He could not even raise a little girl well.\n\n\u201cMy little kid, ever since you\u2019ve been with me, your mouth has not stopped moving,\u201d the old man depressingly said. \u201cWith the way you eat, even if there was a mountain of gold and a mountain of silver, it\u2019d be eaten by you. How did that Han Sen used to raise you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDad would not let me starve. If you are saying you cannot afford to take care of me, I am going back.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked grumpy. She turned around, ready to leave. \u201cLittle kid, I concede. I will take you someplace nice to eat,\u201d the old man said while dragging Bao\u2019er with him.\n\n\u201cOld Liar, don\u2019t you dare try and lie to me.\u201d Bao\u2019er squinted at the old man.\n\n\u201cI would lie to everyone else, yes, but you?\u201d the old man asked. \u201cYou just need to wait here for a bit. I will take you to eat something very nice and spicy. You can eat whatever you want there. I promise you you\u2019ll be full.\u201d \u201cYou are very nice, Old Granddad.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled a lot. She held the old man\u2019s hand and behaved very cutely.\n\n\u201cThis girl\u2026 It does not make sense. How could she have been raised to this age\u2026 How did that bastard Han Sen grow you so big?\u201d The old man was speechless.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Old Liar, I thought you ran out of money.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at the old man and blinked as she spoke to him. \u201cEating food does not require money all the time.\u201d Bao\u2019er was holding a flag while he walked across the street. He went searching for something. Not long later, he bent over and picked up a stone that was sharp and fist-sized.\n\nHe pulled Bao\u2019er along as he kept walking. When they came to a T-junction, he looked to his left and right. He then put the sharp stone on the corner that turned.\n\nBao\u2019er blinked and asked, \u201cCan we get money to eat this way?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, tasty stuff will come here right now,\u201d the old man said. He pulled Bao\u2019er forward to walk with him. Not long later, they stopped near the street. He put down the flag and placed a yellow cloth on the ground. He pulled out a chair and sat on the cloth. He closed his eyes and rested.\n\n\u201cOld Liar, is this going to work?\u201d Bao\u2019er waited for a while, but nothing tasty appeared.\n\n\u201cDo not rush. It is on its merry way.\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes did not open. He looked calm as he spoke to her.\n\nAfter a while, the street suddenly had chickens flying and dogs jumping. They saw a guy riding a gold, big crab gene race. It was skittering around the street, making the street all dirty.\n\nSeeing this big, gold crab that looked like a tank come close to them, the old man\u2019s eyes and lips suddenly became very thin. He then blew out air and made a strange noise. When the big gold crab heard that sound, its crazy moving body came to a halt. The person atop the beast looked rather excited. The gold, big crab came to a stop. It was a sudden one, so the man was thrown right off. It looked like a dog eating sh*t. His head went in front of the fortune-teller old man with a shock.\n\nThe old man looked at the young man who had fallen with his ass sticking up and said, \u201cOld man, I have seen your forehead go dark. Did your head suffer a stroke of misfortune? Today, you will be suffering a curse.\u201d\n\nThe young man picked himself up off the ground. He wiped the blood off his nose, looked at the old man, and coldly said, \u201cOld man, how dare you to start talking to me. Do you have any idea who I am?\u201d\n\nAfter that, the young man reached out his hand to punch the old man. The old man did not move. He coldly said, \u201cIf I am not mistaken, you just experienced changes that can make a sad man very happy. You have an opportunity before you.\u201d\n\nWhen the young man heard that, he was shocked. The fist that was going to strike out was lowered.\n\n\u201cOld man, who sent you here? How could you know everything about me?\u201d The young man stared at the fortune-telling old man and checked him out.\n\nThe fortune-telling old man shook his head. \u201cI do want to save people, but people are always so ignorant. Never mind.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the fortune-telling old man picked up his shop. He took the little girl with him as he left. In the meantime, he said to himself, \u201cGod is jealous of geniuses. What a shame\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, what did you mean, old man? At least, tell me. Otherwise, I am going to break your old teeth. Then, you will never talk crap again.\u201d The young man reached out his hand and stopped the two from leaving.\n\nThe fortune-telling old man sighed and said, \u201cI am afraid you will not believe me even if I do tell you. How about this? I will give you one tidbit. You do not have to pay for it. If it is useful, it will be a pleasure of mine. If it is not useful, neither of us loses a thing.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the old man took out a rope and gave it to the young man.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The young man accepted the rope with suspicion. It seemed to be an ordinary rope. It was less than 9 feet long with small threading.\n\nIf it was not for the fortune-telling man telling him what happened, with that young man\u2019s attitude, he would have hanged the old man with the rope. The old man said, \u201cPut the rope around your waist and put the other on the gene race. Then, you will find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. I will see what you are up to. If this is a waste of time, I am going to come back and break your stupid mouth. Someone come here and keep an eye on this old man.\u201d Because of what the young man shouted, a few big men appeared. They prohibited the old man and the young girl from leaving.\n\n\u201cI have stuff to do. If it does not work, when I come back, you are very dad.\u201d After the young man said that, he jumped atop the crab\u2019s back. Following the instructions given to him by the old man, he tied one end of the rope to his waist and the other end onto the gold crab. He took the crab and sought to leave.\n\n\u201cHang on. Pull the rope one foot and seven inches shorter.\u201d The fortune-telling old man stopped the young man.\n\nThe young man did not really believe him. No matter what happened today, no one would have been able to see it. There was no way for others to know. The fortune-telling old man spoke correctly, which had made him scared. It was hard to believe, which was why he thought he should give it a go.\n\nThe young man pulled the rope shorter and thought, \u201cAfter I am done, if this stupid rope does not do anything, I am going to break his mouth.\u201d\n\nJust as he just tied up the rope, the gold crab turned around and started to spin extremely fast. The young man fell from the crab\u2019s back. The young man\u2019s eyes opened wide. He saw himself almost fall on the ground. His waist felt tight. He was only half a foot away from the ground hanging by the rope.\n\nThe young man had a closer look. He quickly broke out into a cold sweat. There was a sharp rock five inches away from his left eye. If the rope had not pulled him when he fell, he could have been blinded.\n\nHe thought about the consequences of the rope. The young man\u2019s legs went soft. He had a cold sweat. He felt like it was too close.\n\nA few young men surrounded the old man and girl. Many people saw this. The young man, who had gone around the corner, had come back. He was running and screaming, \u201cOld Fairy\u2026 Old Fairy\u2026 Old Fairy you are like a god\u2026\u201d"
