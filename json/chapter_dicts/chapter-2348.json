Aren\u2019t you worried that the Ancient Water God will hear you and kill you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked and said, \u201cI thought that is what you were suggesting.\u201d\n\nAlang rushed to blurt out, \u201cAt what point did I mention that the Ancient Water God was dying? I said we were here to watch the Ancient Water God level up and become a god spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cLevel up to become a god spirit? Does such a level even exist?\u201d Han Sen asked, his brows furrowing.\n\n\u201cIt does, according to the legend. It is something that all who are deified aspire to. It has nothing to do with us vendors, though. We are merely here to just watch and rake in some cash.\u201d Alang stopped and then glanced around. He quietly said, \u201cBut most creatures here seem to believe the Ancient Water God will fail. So, they are here to try their luck. They want the Ancient God Origin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAncient God Origin? What is that?\u201d Han Sen asked, blinking.\n\nAlang looked at Han Sen with shock and said, \u201cHandsome, if you don\u2019t know what an Ancient God Origin is, why are you even here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is business that doesn\u2019t concern you. Hurry up and tell me what the Ancient God Origin is,\u201d Han Sen said coldly.\n\nAlang shrugged and said, \u201cAncient Gods exist differently than ordinary people and creatures. If one is born, then one must die. If one dies, then another will be born. Only when the older Ancient Gods die can there be a new one. In this universe, there is a fixed number of Ancient Gods. There cannot be any more or any less than a predetermined amount. If Ancient Water God fails to become a god spirit, he will leave behind an Ancient God Origin. That Ancient God Origin will turn into a new Ancient Water God, and it will be born deified.\u201d\n\nAlang paused and said, \u201cThe Ancient God Origin is just like the egg of another race. You need the same elemental powers to hatch it. If you get approved by the Ancient God Origin, it will follow you. To a water element creature, that is sure to be a grand servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething that great actually exists? If I ate the Ancient God Origin, would I become deified?\u201d Han Sen stroked his face as he spoke.\n\n\u201cEat it?\u201d Alang\u2019s eyebrows looked like they were going to disappear into his hair. He peered at Han Sen as if he had just seen a ghost. A while later, he said, \u201cAncient Gods are born deified. They have scary amounts of power. Even if a deified was there, they could do nothing to an Ancient God Origin. Plus, the Ancient God have many deified elites already. They will be protecting it. They would not allow any other deifieds to get close to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. But if a deified cannot eat it, that doesn\u2019t mean that I couldn\u2019t. This is a good opportunity for me. If I can nab the Ancient God Origin, I can nourish myself a great deal.\u201d After saying that, Han Sen turned to leave, ignoring Alang.\n\nNow Han Sen understood why Miss Mirror had brought him to watch the Ancient Water God become a god spirit. She probably wanted to see if Han Sen could get the Ancient God Origin. But Han Sen still didn\u2019t know why Miss Mirror would want it.\n\nAs Han Sen walked, he suddenly had a cold chill. He sneezed and rubbed his nose, and he spoke to himself, \u201cWho is missing?\u201d\n\nHan Sen continued walking away, but he did not see Alang gritting his teeth as he watched Han Sen walk away. The man\u2019s eyeballs almost popped out of their sockets in his anger.\n\n\u201cHow dare he want to eat my Ancient God Origin? Let\u2019s see how you eat it while you\u2019re dealing with this,\u201d Alang snarled. His body spun around, and he and the items in his stall turned into water. He went into the sand, and then, he disappeared without a trace.\n\n\u201cHachoo! Hachoo! Hachoo!\u201d Han Sen kept on sneezing as if he had suddenly suffered the flu. He felt himself growing fevered, and snot oozed continually from his nose.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t feel good. He had the body of a Duke, and he had a King class Original Water King Body. How could he possibly get sick?\n\nHan Sen used some of his power to look himself over. He didn\u2019t detect anything unusual, but his body felt cold and a little dizzy. He sneezed and blew out snot. It looked as if he had come down with the flu.\n\nWhen Han Sen went back to Miss Mirror\u2019s peak, his body was so cold, and his head was spinning rapidly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Miss Mirror frowned and looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It\u2019s like I have the flu\u2026\u201d Han Sen\u2019s body was so cold. His head was burning, and it had been years since he had felt this way.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s face changed. She leaped over to Han Sen and placed a hand on his forehead. Han Sen felt power rush out of Miss Mirror\u2019s hand and sweep into his body.\n\nThat power was icy cold, and when it went into Han Sen\u2019s body, it quickly swirled around. It made Han Sen feel a bit better, but that sick feeling was still present.\n\n\u201cWhere were you, and who did you encounter?\u201d Miss Mirror\u2019s face looked cold as she asked the question.\n\n\u201cI was over there, down in the markets. I just walked around and spoke to a stall owner.\u201d Han Sen pointed to the market below them.\n\nMiss Mirror wrapped an arm around Han Sen. She moved her body, and they suddenly teleported to the market.\n\nMiss Mirror looked around and asked Han Sen, \u201cWhich stall owner?\u201d\n\nHan Sen struggled to fight off the dizziness. He brought Miss Mirror through the market to reach that corner.\n\n\u201cHe was just here\u2026\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face grew increasingly worried. Alang and the store were gone. He knew that must have happened when he left.\n\nHan Sen was always careful. When he came up to the stall owner to ask his questions, he had already examined Alang. There was nothing strange about the man. Han Sen didn\u2019t know where he had caught the sickness.\n\nFortunately, at that moment, aside from the flu-like symptoms, nothing bad was happening to his body.\n\n\u201cHuh, you dare to hide from me? Let us see who you really are!\u201d Miss Mirror grunted. She raised her hand and pulled out an old mirror.\n\nThe old mirror faced Han Sen\u2019s finger. The light in the mirror started to swirl into an image, and the image looked like an old video that was being rewound.\n\nThe video in the mirror was rewound very fast. All the items and creatures that were once there were now revealed clearly. It rewound to a few days before, but there was just an empty landscape.\n\n\u201cThere really was a stall,\u201d Han Sen said, when Miss Mirror turned to look at him. Han Sen stomach sank.\n\nMiss Mirror frowned and said, \u201cI would rather you were lying. If you aren\u2019t lying, then you really did attract the attention of a very scary guy. Even my Space Mirror is unable to reveal any trace of him having been here. He must have been a very scary deified elite.\u201d"
