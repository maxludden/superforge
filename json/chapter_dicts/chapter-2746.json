    "text": "Now that they had the Sit and Forget Sutra, Li Keer and Exquisite had no more time to follow Han Sen around. The two of them had to relinquish all their other duties and focus on practicing. They needed to take the time to practice the Sit and Forget Sutra now, while their memories were still fresh.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t keen on focusing on the Sit and Forget Sutra. Although the geno art was certainly amazing, its style wasn\u2019t very suitable for him.\n\nHan Sen had learned the Under the Sky mind, and that meant he was walking a road that went against the Sit and Forget Sutra. He wasn\u2019t willing to traverse the Sit and Forget Sutra\u2019s old path. He only used the Sit and Forget Sutra to finish his Under the Sky. Once he did that, his Under the Sky mind had a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cDeified xenogeneic gene consumed. Deified gene +1, evolution progress 1/100.\u201d\n\nSince he was now unwatched by the two women, Han Sen brought out the deified genes he had hidden. Now that he was deified, he was able to absorb and refine them, allowing their powers to develop and reinforce his body.\n\nOver the course of the next few days, Han Sen did little else. Han Sen consumed all of the deified genes that he had saved up. By the end, he had eaten 23 deified genes.\n\nEvery deified gene boosted the fitness of Han Sen\u2019s body. He was now even stronger than he had been before.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the deified rank works the same as the others. If I get a hundred deified genes, I can make my body evolve. Luckily, the body of one deified xenogeneic can provide up to ten deified genes. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult to get 100. Outer Sky has many deified xenogeneics roaming about. At this point, why should I wait?\u201d Han Sen thought, realizing that there was nothing to stop him from killing deified xenogeneics.\n\nHe brought out his map of Outer Sky. He researched the deified xenogeneics that were in the vicinity and where he might find them. When he was done, he made the decision to head to the Buried Dragon Sea to hunt xenogeneics.\n\nLegends claimed that a true god class dragon had once fallen into the sea. Whether or not that was true was up for debate, but high-class deified xenogeneics rarely appeared near the Buried Dragon Sea.\n\nThat was the main reason that Han Sen decided to go to the Buried Dragon Sea. Not many deified xenogeneics were born there, so it would be a safer place than most for Han Sen to hunt.\n\nHan Sen had expected to have a difficult time convincing Bao\u2019er to stay behind, but he only had to speak one sentence before Bao\u2019er was agreeing. To Han Sen\u2019s utter astonishment, she didn\u2019t insist on going to Buried Dragon Sea with him. It caught Han Sen completely off-guard.\n\nHe looked at the Six-Eared Macaque. Its face looked terrible. Its neck was buried between raised shoulders, and it seemed to be trying to hide from everything in sight. Han Sen finally understood; Bao\u2019er had found herself a new toy.\n\nHan Sen allowed Bao\u2019er to look after the Star Tree while he was gone. After he readied himself, he set out for the Buried Dragon Sea.\n\nWhen he reached the outskirts of the sea, he saw people fighting in the distance. When he got a little closer to see what was going on, he saw that it was Princess Bai Wei of the Extreme King. Her presence gave him a shock.\n\nUpon seeing Han Sen, Bai Wei said nothing. She kept fighting the half-deified flying fish xenogeneic. After she killed the xenogeneic, she remained atop the waves, staring back at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cPrincess Bai Wei. Long time no see. What are you doing all the way out here?\u201d Han Sen said with a cough.\n\nBai Wei had been the one who first took Han Sen to the Extreme King. That seemed like a long time ago now. There, Han Sen had murdered Prince Bai Yi and stolen the dead man\u2019s identity. For the longest time, he allowed Bai Wei to believe that Bai Yi had killed him instead. On top of that, Han Sen now had a terrible relationship with the Extreme King. It was quite awkward for them to meet now.\n\n\u201cYou can be a Very High silkworm, but I cannot?\u201d Bai Wei said coldly. Her eyes flickered with some strange emotion.\n\nHan Sen suddenly understood. After the last silkworm bout, a few of the silkworms had probably been cast away. Bai Wei must have been one of the replacement silkworms.\n\nHan Sen realized that he had no idea what to say. His relationship with Bai Wei was too strange for him to formulate a sentence. They were once allies, but he killed Bai Wei\u2019s older brother and went on to start a very unpleasant feud with the Extreme King. He didn\u2019t know where they were supposed to go from here.\n\n\u201cYou are here to kill xenogeneics in the Buried Dragon Sea?\u201d Bai Wei asked. She seemed to be feeling generous.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t planning to cause me trouble, then let\u2019s go,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He hadn\u2019t expected Bai Wei to suggest that they go out and kill xenogeneics together.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s inconvenient for you, then don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Bai Wei said when Han Sen didn\u2019t respond or make a move. She was ready to move on without him.\n\n\u201cWhy would it not be convenient? Killing xenogeneics with a fair queen would be an absolute pleasure,\u201d Han Sen said quickly.\n\nBai Wei had once tried to save Bao\u2019er. She had been willing to make great sacrifices to someone she believed to be Bai Yi. Therefore, Han Sen felt as if he owed her one.\n\n\u201cCall me Bai Wei,\u201d Bai Wei said. She looked around and said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many xenogeneics here in the shallow sea. The few that you can find tend to be low level. If you want to kill deified xenogeneics, you are going to have to venture into the deeper recesses of the sea to find them.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us go to the deep sea, then.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t a very eloquent man, nor was he skilled at small talk. This situation was especially difficult for him since he felt guilty about what he had put Bai Wei through. He wasn\u2019t sure how to relate to her or what the connection between them was supposed to mean, so they didn\u2019t speak as they dove into the deep sea together. The atmosphere was awkward.\n\nThey encountered some xenogeneics in the sea, and Bai Wei was able to kill them with ease. She had improved a lot. Although she wasn\u2019t yet deified, she was half-deified. Her performance of the Extreme King\u2019s Shocking Sky Punch wasn\u2019t bad.\n\nAfter Bai Wei took down a half-deified jellyfish with one punch, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but compliment her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen you in so long. You have grown so much.\u201d\n\nBai Wei gave Han Sen an expressionless glance and said, \u201cYou were lower level than me, and now you are deified. I\u2019m still just half-deified. Do you really think that means I\u2019ve been developing quickly?\u201d\n\nHan Sen touched his nose and didn\u2019t say anything.The two of them continued to dive deeper. Not long after, they reached the sea bed and found a weird sea creature that was ten meters long floating above the sand. The creature\u2019s body was flat and colored blue.\n\nIts tail was akin to a lobster\u2019s tail, and pincers curled from the front of its body like a scorpion. Six claws of various lengths hung from its belly.\n\nThe xenogeneic looked like a shrimp or a crab. It kind of looked like a scorpion. It was an incredibly strange being, but blue substance chains rose from its body. It was clearly a deified xenogeneic.\n\nWithout Exquisite or Li Keer around, Han Sen merrily activated his Dongxuan Sutra. He could detect that the xenogeneic was a primitive deified, so he moved calmly toward it.\n\nBefore Han Sen and Bai Wei got close, though, the xenogeneic noticed them. It raised its pincers, and its blue substance chains suddenly exploded. A large portion of the sea was painted dark blue, which somehow clouded Han Sen and Bai Wei\u2019s seven senses. They could no longer tell where the xenogeneic was.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He was about to use his Dongxuan Area, but he suddenly saw Bai Wei\u2019s body shake. The power that protected her vanished, and she fell down through the water.\n\nHan Sen put out his hand and used his power to pull Bai Wei toward him. He picked up her body and saw that her skin looked a bit blue. It was transparent like jade. She\u2019d been hit."
