Can xenogeneics make use of xenogeneic treasures?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nDong!\n\nThe bronze bell landed on something, and then it stopped moving. Yisha continued to strike the bell with her knife air, but the bronze bell suddenly lifted away from them. It flew to the side, freeing them.\n\nYisha immediately surrounded Han Sen and the blood kirin with her power to protect them.\n\nBased on the direction that the bell had moved after it covered them, they should have been standing inside the white whale, probably in its stomach. A deified xenogeneic\u2019s digestion system wasn\u2019t something an ordinary creature could hope to withstand. Even King class elites would dissolve quickly inside such a stomach.\n\nBut when Han Sen and Yisha looked around, they froze.\n\nThis was not a stomach. It was a control room of high-end technology. The tech around them equaled any that might be found in a classy battleship\u2019s control room.\n\nThe most unbelievable thing was that everything in the control room was transparent. They could see outside of the room, and the feelings that the sight elicited were difficult to explain.\n\nAlthough it looked like a whale from the exterior, it was actually governed by machinery. Every piece of the whale\u2019s interior was made of crystal of various colors.\n\nHumming generators, pounding pistons, and spinning every movement could be seen from where they were.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d This time, Han Sen was really shocked.\n\nThe white whale had looked like a deified creature from the outside, but it was actually a technological marvel. It was hard to believe that such an amazing machine actually existed.\n\nYisha looked around in shock. Their eyes soon turned to a platform of that primary control room.\n\nA man had been sitting in a chair behind the control platform. It was little more than a skeleton at this point, with a few white bones still wrapped in the clothes he had been wearing.\n\nThe man\u2019s clothes looked like a high-tech product, not some treasure armor. Judging from the style of the silver and black clothing, it was possible to determine that the skeleton had been a man.\n\nAfter bringing Han Sen and the others into the room, the bronze bell had drastically reduced its size. It was now about the size of a man\u2019s fist, and it rested there in the main control room.\n\n\u201cDoes this sort of technology exist anywhere else in the geno universe?\u201d Han Sen looked at Yisha. He had no idea what race might have constructed this marvel of technology.\n\nYisha shook her head. \u201cThere are many technological wonders that have the destructive powers of a deified being, but not many can actually be used in combat. They take far too long to aim and fire, so they can\u2019t be used in actual deified fights. They are mostly useful for attacking planets, since planets cannot be moved. The Meka\u2019s bio armor is also technological in nature. They have very powerful weapons, but again, they are different from what we\u2019re seeing here.\u201d\n\nClearly, Yisha was just as clueless as Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis has to be another one of the Sacred Leader\u2019s creations. Sacred achieved a lot when it came to technology,\u201d Han Sen pondered aloud as he looked around.\n\nSince the white whale\u2019s master appeared to be quite dead, how could the white whale continue to move without someone at the controls? And what had prompted the behemoth to swallow them?\n\nYisha walked toward the skeleton. She waved her hand, and one of her purple substance chains dissolved into a purple mist. The mist flowed over the skeleton and began to poke around it. She was looking for some lead or clue they could follow.\n\nBut before Yisha\u2019s purple air touched the skeleton, the bronze bell rose from its resting platform and covered up Yisha\u2019s purple air at once.\n\n\u201cHuh. This old bronze bell defends its master automatically. Is it a piece of technology, as well?\u201d Han Sen looked at the old bronze bell in shock.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen and Yisha heard a boy\u2019s voice. \u201cYou are a technological product. Your entire family is a technological product.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Han Sen and Yisha were shocked. They looked around them, but neither of them could sense any presences.\n\nThere was just that sole skeleton sitting on the primary control deck. It made Han Sen and Yisha feel very uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cNo way! Have we encountered a ghost?\u201d Han Sen muttered as he stared at the skeleton. He used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the skeleton multiple times, but there was no lifeforce. It couldn\u2019t have been any more dead, so there was no way that the voice was coming from it. Han Sen could only think that they must be talking to a ghost.\n\n\u201cYou are a ghost. Your entire family is a ghost.\u201d The little boy\u2019s voice was heard again, and it sounded pretty mad.\n\nThis time, Han Sen and Yisha located the source of the voice. It came from the little bronze bell.\n\nThe bronze bell shook. Strange symbols glowed across it, and it opened shiny green eyes.\n\nBelow its eyes was a gap. It looked like a mouth that kept opening and closing.\n\nHan Sen stared at the bronze bell that was shouting at him. The body of the bell seemed to be vibrating with rage.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t know how to react. He hadn\u2019t displayed any signs of a lifeforce, so he thought it must be a xenogeneic treasure. But now that it was talking, it certainly seemed to possess all the traits and characteristics of a living creature.\n\n\u201cYou are a thing. Your entire family is a thing.\u201d The bronze bell was becoming even angrier. It was jumping up and down as it shouted.\n\n\u201cAre you an AI? If you are, it seems like you are a very cheap one. You can only say the same thing over and over,\u201d Han Sen said, looking at the bronze bell with curiosity.\n\nThe bronze bell started to yell, \u201cYou are a\u2026\u201d\n\nIt trailed off halfway through its shout. If it continued, people really would believe it was an AI.\n\nSo, after its half shout, the bronze bell stopped and settled down a little. With a very cocky look, it said, \u201cYou stupid low life creature. Listen up! Your master\u2019s name is Big King Bell, but you guys can call me either Master or Big King.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Big King Bell thought of something. It looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYour master is not some sort of AI.\u201d"
