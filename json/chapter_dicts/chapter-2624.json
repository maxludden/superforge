    "text": "Sky Palace Leader said it would take a few days to finish his preparations of sealing the Charming God\u2019s Jian. Han Sen agreed to leave the weapon with him in the meantime. He was the leader of Sky Palace, so it was unlikely that he\u2019d be greedy enough to steal the Charming God\u2019s Jian for himself. Even if he did steal it, though, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t mind. As long as the weapon no longer plagued him with women or returned to him when he tried to get rid of it, he wouldn\u2019t mind anything that would get the item away from him.\n\n\u201cIf it can be sealed, I wonder if I can ask Sky Palace Leader to seal Ning Yue\u2019s little green sword as well,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBut Ning Yue\u2019s situation was vastly different from Han Sen\u2019s. After the power of the Charming God\u2019s Jian was sealed, it wouldn\u2019t have any effect on Han Sen\u2019s power.\n\nHan Sen had his super god spirit body. He could remove any abnormal changes that tried to debilitate him. He could get rid of his ears and tail, but Ning Yue\u2019s super god body didn\u2019t do anything like that. He was forever bound to be a weak, little woman.\n\nThe little green sword had affected her leveling. Ning Yue had become lazy, and without the little green sword\u2019s power, she might never level up again.\n\nBack on the little jade island, Han Sen waited a couple more days. The Charming God\u2019s Jian had yet to return, which made him feel quite relieved.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t go anywhere for a few more days. He just remained on his little jade island, waiting.\n\nOn the fourth day, a Sky Palace guard requested that Han Sen pay a visit to the leader in his garden. Han Sen was to receive his Charming God\u2019s Jian again.\n\nBut when Han Sen saw the weapon this time, there was a layer of rust on it. The engravings that once adorned it were no longer visible. No one would believe that this rusted chunk of metal was a race weapon.\n\n\u201cThe sealing is complete. Unless someone forcibly removes the seal, the jian should no longer affect you, and you will no longer be able to make use of its power,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said in a toneless voice.\n\n\u201cThank you, Leader!\u201d Han Sen happily proclaimed.\n\n\u201cI have to remind you that you\u2019ll spend three days every month teaching,\u201d Sky Palace Leader smiled.\n\nHan Sen left the garden without mentioning Ning Yue\u2019s little green sword. If people learned that Ning Yue had a race weapon, a lot of greedy eyes would be directed toward her. Ning Yue wasn\u2019t strong enough to repel others from taking her little green sword, so Han Sen thought it would be best to forego that idea. Back on the little jade island, Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra to push his self-cogwheel and enter the core hall. In the hall, he used his super god spirit body to remove his fox ears and tail.\n\n\u201cAh, that feels better.\u201d Han Sen touched his head and felt nothing that didn\u2019t belong there. He let out a sigh of relief.\n\nHe entered the core area under his Dollar persona. This was his first time using his Dollar identity to enter the core area this year.\n\nHan Sen looked around. He didn\u2019t see the small crocodile god or the bronze furnace.\n\n\u201cIt has been a whole year. I wonder if they have traveled away from here.\u201d While Han Sen had been under the effects of the Charming God\u2019s Jian, he hadn\u2019t wanted to enter the core area as Dollar. He\u2019d been afraid that someone would figure out that he was Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen considered where he should go for a minute, then he took off. He hadn\u2019t been flying for long when he saw Li Keer coming toward him. Exquisite was accompanying her.\n\n\u201cDollar, you\u2019re here!\u201d Li Keer looked surprised. She quickly hurried to Han Sen\u2019s side.\n\nShe had waited a whole year to see Dollar again. It had been a painful time for her. If she had known how long it would take, she wouldn\u2019t have gone to all the trouble.\n\n\u201cThis might be another encounter of fate. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ve run into each other yet again,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cFate? I\u2019ve been waiting here for you for a whole year!\u201d Li Keer rolled her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Han Sen asked with surprise.\n\nLi Keer hesitated, but she had made up her mind. She wasn\u2019t going to let this chance slip by again. If Dollar left again, she had no clue how long she would have to wait next time.\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest with you, I am a Very High student. My people are recruiting. I hope you can come with me to the Very High. Our people can provide many resources and geno arts to make you deified. You\u2019d only have to work for me for four years,\u201d Li Keer said, speaking loudly and clearly. She wanted to make sure that this chance didn\u2019t go to waste.\n\nHan Sen was stunned. He hadn\u2019t realized that Li Keer wanted to take him to the Very High, too.\n\n\u201cI am sorry, but I\u2019m afraid I must disappoint you. I hate being restricted. I would rather end my life than be contractually bound to anyone or anything.\u201d Han Sen had never had any interest in going to the Very High. He certainly wouldn\u2019t change his mind on Li Keer\u2019s account.\n\nLi Keer was shocked. She couldn\u2019t believe Han Sen had rejected her offer without even thinking it over.\n\n\u201cPlease think about it! This isn\u2019t a bad deal for you. My race will provide you with deified resources,\u201d Li Keer pleaded. After spending this long on Dollar, she wouldn\u2019t give up easily.\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen with surprise. She thought she was unlucky, having two guys reject her. She couldn\u2019t believe Li Keer was experiencing the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I would prefer to remain your friend, and nothing more.\u201d Han Sen tried to soften the blow of his abrupt rejection.\n\nLi Keer understood Han Sen\u2019s line of thinking, but she just shook her head and said nothing. She was disappointed. Anyone who had waited a whole year for that result would be quite upset.\n\n\u201cDid you two see the small crocodile god and bronze furnace?\u201d Han Sen asked, quickly moving on from their previous conversation.\n\n\u201cThey should be in that system.\u201d Li Keer pointed in a specific direction for Han Sen, and then hastily departed the core area with Exquisite. She was extremely disappointed.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, have we been too quiet for too long? Have the other races forgotten how powerful the Very High are?\u201d Li Keer looked at Exquisite with sadness.\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cSpecial people just aren\u2019t willing to simply hand themselves and their fate over to others. If you really want Dollar to be your silkworm, you\u2019ll need patience.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Exquisite started to think about Han Sen.Exquisite had grown very troubled lately. She wanted to get closer to Han Sen and establish some sort of a bond with him. That way, she hoped Han Sen would accept her offer and become her silkworm.\n\nBut not even she was able to resist the power of the Charming God\u2019s Jian. So, every time she saw Han Sen, her mind would flood with all kinds of naughty ideas. She worried about acting those out every time she laid eyes on him.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, you seem different. Is Han Sen really so special that he has made you change your tone?\u201d Li Keer looked at Exquisite with wide eyes. She had never imagined that Exquisite would talk about potential silkworms like this. It made Li Keer interested in who Han Sen was.\n\n\u201cEveryone has some kind of flaw, even the very skilled,\u201d Exquisite mumbled. She didn\u2019t even know what she was feeling.\n\nLi Keer looked at Exquisite. Her Third Sister had been acting rather strange lately.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of man is Han Sen? How can he make Third Sister forget her Very High Forget Love?\u201d Li Keer asked with confusion.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what Li Keer and Exquisite were talking about. He continued to fly. When he saw the bronze furnace, he was given a fright.\n\nThe bronze furnace was as big as a castle. There had to be tens of millions of weapons inside its blazing fire. God knew how many resources it had gained by following the small crocodile god. It had forged countless weapons."
