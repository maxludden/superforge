    "text": "\"Meow...\" Meowth was circling around the fire rapidly. In the fire, there were pieces of jelly-like sawfish meat. When heated up, the oil oozed from the fish, sizzling with a strong and fresh fragrance, making one\u2019s mouth water even from afar.\n\nHan Sen threw a large piece of cooked sawfish to Meowth and took one for himself. The fatty fish almost melted in his mouth, making him want to swallow his tongue.\n\nSawfish, as a mutant creature, had way more tasty meat than ordinary fish. Even fish like groupers were a far cry from it. Even just barbecued plainly with just some salt and pepper, the sawfish didn\u2019t have a fishy smell at all, it was purely sweet and delicious.\n\n\"If this could be brought outside God\u2019s Sanctuary, it would probably become the king of all fish. The ordinary dish wouldn\u2019t even have any market. One mutant sawfish could probably be sold at tens of million. Such a shame...\" Han Sen threw another piece of sawfish at Meowth.\n\nMutant creatures could not be brought away from God\u2019s Sanctuary. Also, he didn\u2019t have the energy to take all the sawfish he had hunted out of Dark Swamp. There were more sawfish in the lake than he had imagined. He had killed 15 these days. After eating several, his mutant geno points could no longer increase from eating sawfish. Since he couldn\u2019t bring it all out, he decided to feed it to Meowth.\n\n\"My mutant geno points are 31 now. Such a fruitful trip! Dark Swamp is too dangerous for ordinary people, so there live so many mutant creatures. Probably I could even max out on my mutant geno points on this trip.\" Han Sen was in a great mood and rewarded Meowth another piece of fish.\n\nThe rest of the sawfish meat was made into jerkies by Han Sen. Before he left, he took another look inside the lake, to check if there was any fish that he had missed.\n\nSeeing another mutant golden sawfish, Han Sen killed it in the same way.\n\n\"Mutant sawfish killed. Beast soul of mutant sawfish gained. Eat its meat to gain zero to ten mutant geno points randomly.\"\n\nIt took Han Sen several seconds before he realized what had happened. He almost jumped up. It had been a long time since he had gained any beast soul and he suddenly gained one now. A mutant one!\n\nHan Sen could not wait to see which type the sawfish beast soul was. If it was an arrow, he would be so satisfied.\n\nType of mutant sawfish beast soul: Spear.\n\nHen Sen was slightly disappointed, but overall excited. Although it was not a beast soul arrow, spear was still a popular type of weapon, especially a mutant beast soul spear.\n\nSummoning the mutant sawfish beast soul, Han San suddenly had a gold spear in his hands. The spearhead was an inch long with sharpened cutting edge on both sides. The spear was frightening even by its look.\n\nHan Sen wielded the spear and felt that it was heavy but easy to use. The sharp spearhead had cut down a thick tree with just a casual slash, as if he were cutting tofu.\n\n\"Whoever pisses me off in the future will have to deal with this spear!\" Han Sen tried the spear for a while, and didn\u2019t put it away until he had sweat on his forehead.\n\nA mutant beast soul weapon had already made his trip to Dark Swamp a success. This spear was enough to make an ordinary household rich.\n\nAfter all, beast soul weapons did not need to be repaired and was easy to carry. Unless it was destroyed completely, it would recover on its own, unlike Z-steel weapons that needed fixing if chipped.\n\nAlthough he had gained a lot, Han Sen still hadn\u2019t reached his main goal, which was to gain a much-needed mutant beast soul arrow. So, he carried the rest of the jerkies and flew into the Dark Swamp again.\n\nThe poster was only trying to escape and couldn\u2019t tell the directions. Hence it was difficult to find the forest he mentioned.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen had the ability to fly, so he could see far from the sky.\n\nIn the next two days, Han Sen was not so lucky. He did not encounter mutant creatures, but ran into swarms of poisonous insects several times. Watching countless insects moving under him like flood and leaving nothing alive behind them, Han Sen could not help but shuddered.\n\nIf he couldn\u2019t fly and were attacked by these insects, it wouldn\u2019t even matter if he was fit or not. Swarms of ants could kill an elephant, let alone these poisonous insects. Even someone with max sacred geno points could hardly survive.\n\nFinally, Han Sen found some clean water. After replenishing his water supply, he made a pot of fish soup and added some snake king meat in it.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before the fragrance spread everywhere. Han Sen wasn\u2019t afraid of attracting poisonous beasts as he had been wearing the black beetle armor since he entered Dark Swamp.\n\nWhen the soup was almost ready, Han Sen was preparing to enjoy it with Meowth. Suddenly he heard a bird call followed by a whistle. A huge black bird flied down from the sky, its wings a few dozen feet long and claws sharp as metal hooks.\n\nHansen was shocked, \"Damn, didn\u2019t the poster say there were no advanced flying creatures in Dark Swamp? Judging from its look, this bird is at least a mutant creature.\"\n\nHansen stepped back and saw the huge bird landing by the fire. When it stood on the ground, it was taller than an elephant head. Its gleaming dark bird eyes gave it a regal look.\n\nAfter the bird landed, a black-clad young man jumped down from the back of the bird and looked at the meat in the pot, \"Boy, I\u2019ll buy your meat.\"\n\nHe walked swaggeringly over and threw a piece of raw meat that looked like a cow leg on the ground and said, \"It\u2019s your lucky day kid. This is the thigh of a mutant poisonous-clawed beast.\"\n\nFinishing the sentence, the black-clad young man reached for the fragrant fish and snake meat in the pot.\n\n\"I won\u2019t trade with you,\" Han Sen frowned.\n\nThe black-clad young man was fast and had already gobbled up a piece of fish. When he was about to ridicule Han Sen by pointing out the fact that he was offering Han Sen some mutant creature meat, he heard the voice telling him that he had gained one mutant geno point. His eyes suddenly widened, \"How could this be? It was just one piece of meat, and it added one mutant geno point. So\u2026 there must be an entire mutant creature in the pot?\""
