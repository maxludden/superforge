    "text": "The dog-faced man coldly grunted. He took two steps back. He went behind the stone pillar. There were 10,000 red scale lights landing on the door. The broken pillar next to the door had a space swirl generate. The red scale lights landed on it, and it vanished. It was like it had absorbed the door.\n\n\u201cVery good Sacred. The door is broken and only two pillars remain, but it can still hold firm against an attack delivered by a true god creature. It is no wonder why they were the scariest existence in the universe.\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nThe dog-faced man stood behind the stone pillar. While the big goldfish power was absorbed by the door, he quickly fired another two arrows. He rapidly fired at the goldfish family.\n\nThe big goldfish fired a barrage of bubbles. He did it to prohibit the flight of the two arrows. The two teeth arrows were still able to pierce the bubbles and not get caught by them.\n\nThe big goldfish was shocked and angry, but it was too late for it to block.\n\nThe big goldfish moved and dodged the two teeth arrows. The little goldfish was not able to move so quickly. It was going to be shot in the head.\n\nThe teeth arrows were able to damage the big goldfish, but the little goldfish was only larva class. The arrow was going to pierce through its head and body.\n\nDong!\n\nSeeing the teeth arrow was going to perforate the head of the small goldfish, a knife suddenly slashed against the teeth arrow. The teeth arrow flew away. The small goldfish went behind the big goldfish.\n\nHan Sen was holding the cause karma knife. He was just standing there looking at the dog-faced man. He asked, \u201cWhat is your name? Who from Sacred are you?\u201d\n\nThe dog-faced man should have been a xenogeneic, as well as true god class. He must have been quite famous in the Sacred leagues.\n\n\u201cYou are just a crystallizer, a servant of Sacred, yet you don\u2019t know my name.\u201d The dog-faced man grabbed the teeth arrow that had flown back. His eyes looked very evil. He drew the bowstring again and aimed at Han Sen.\n\nWhen the bowstring was pulled, Han Sen felt a huge amount of power go into that draw. It made people feel very scared. It was like some toxic snake was ready to launch itself at any second.\n\nAs Han Sen stared at the bow, he thought, \u201cThis dog-faced man\u2019s power is average for a true god. He is not as strong as me, but his bow is a bit weird.\u201d\n\nThe dog-faced man smiled. The teeth arrow in his hands was launched. The teeth arrow disappeared in space. It was like it could teleport through space to land on Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHa! You have a death wish.\u201d Upon seeing Han Sen get shot, the dog-faced man let out a cruel laugh.\n\nIn the next second, the dog-faced man saw Han Sen appear in front of him. The area on Han Sen\u2019s body that had been hit with the arrow was fading.\n\nPat!\n\nHan Sen slapped the dog-faced man in the face. The dog-faced man went flying back against the stone pillar. Han Sen took his bow away.\n\n\u201cYou are very cheap, and your arrow skills are bad. Let me teach you how to really use a bow.\u201d Han Sen was holding the bow. He pulled the string back and aimed at the dog-faced man, who was stumbling back onto his feet and crawling closer.\n\nThe dog-faced man wanted to shout so badly, but he saw the arrow was being aimed at him. He was shocked. The cold sweat that had developed on his brow was starting to soak his entire body. It was like someone was strangling him, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nThe dog-faced man had a weird feeling. He felt that if he moved an inch, the teeth arrow was going to break his brain. So, the dog-faced man stood where he was and did not dare to move. He continued to sweat.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? He is just a crystallizer servant\u2026 How is he so powerful\u2026\u201d The dog-faced man was sweating profusely, but he did not move. He was shocked.\n\nHan Sen was getting ready to shoot the dog-faced man when he suddenly felt the teleporter move. He saw a few people appear at the teleporter. It was Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster was shocked to see Han Sen there. They had not stopped in their journey and had traveled at a blistering pace. Yet, Han Sen had already reached the Sacred ruin before them.\n\nUpon seeing more creatures appear, the big goldfish swam toward Han Sen with the little goldfish. He was looking at them.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster looked at Han Sen and the big goldfish. He then glanced at the dog-faced man with a bow aiming right at him. He smiled as he asked, \u201cHan Godfather, what is the situation here?\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cI do not know what this xenogeneic is. He was hiding behind the pillar firing arrows. Give me a minute, Grandmaster. Let me get rid of this xenogeneic, and I will talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are just a crystallizer servant,\u201d the dog-faced man said while gnashing his teeth. \u201cHow dare you say that! If you dare touch me, my mother will kill you so badly that you won\u2019t even have a body left to bury.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and who is your mother?\u201d Han Sen looked at the dog-faced man.\n\nThe dog-faced man gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cMy mother is Moon Shadow God. If you touch me, she will rip you to shreds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoon Shadow God? Does someone like that belong in Sacred? I have never heard of them before.\u201d Han Sen had a long think about it. Out of the 10 generals and four Sacred beasts, there was no one with that name.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster looked surprised. He looked at the dog-faced man and asked, \u201cIs your mother Moon Shadow God?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. My mother is Moon Shadow God. My name is Qige. If you know how powerful my mother is, then give me back the Dog Crow Bow. Otherwise, you are all dead.\u201d For someone to know his mother\u2019s name, it made the dog-faced man very cocky.\n\nHan Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. He was not afraid of anyone. He just wanted to know who Moon Shadow God was.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster smiled and spoke to Han Sen. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard about Moon Shadow God? You must have surely heard about Crow Sky Dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of Sacred\u2019s 10 generals?\u201d Han Sen asked. \u201cHe is the one called Crow Sky Dog.\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster looked at Qige as he said, \u201cYes. Crow Sky God was one of Sacred\u2019s generals who guarded the door. Moon Shadow God was his wife. He was a true god xenogeneic, but they were not of the same race. Judging from this guy\u2019s face, he does look like Crow Sky Dog and Moon Shadow God\u2019s hybrid child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. He is the dog hybrid from Crow Sky Dog and Moon Shadow God.\u201d A voice came out from Sacred\u2019s door. Someone soon walked out.\n\nHan Sen, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, and all the others looked towards there. They saw the person walk out of the dark. He was wearing a gold robe. He had white hair and a white beard. He was an old man, but his bones were very strong. He looked very powerful. Although he was walking alone, he seemed like a king coming forth. He was so powerful that one could not describe it.\n\n\u201cNine Thousand King.\u201d When Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and a few of the Extreme King deified elite saw the gold-robed elder, their expressions changed. One of the deified elites screamed.\n\n\u201cI did not expect that in this universe, there are some who still remember me,\u201d Nine Thousand King coldly said."
