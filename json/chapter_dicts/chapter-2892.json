    "text": "Destroyed Leader had been killed during another race\u2019s fight. They were not even connected to those events, but they were heavily damaged.\n\nThe Destroyed were the fifth high race. There were many true gods in the Destroyed, but Destroyed Leader was the leader of them all. He still had the highest power and was the most revered.\n\nTo the three high races, the death of a true god did not greatly affect their power. The Destroyed were different. The loss of a true god meant they were half-dead. Some factions that wanted to attack the Destroyed were now on the move. It made the Destroyed\u2019s race descend into chaos.\n\nGodfather Han Sen\u2019s name was like a sun in the sky of the universe. Previously, Godfather Han\u2019s name was a little bit playful. Now, whenever a creature mentioned Godfather Han, it was less of a joke and more of a name of terror.\n\nMaking a true god a butterfly class and turning a deified Burning Lamp into an ordinary creature was wild. Other creatures were always scared of deified elites, but they were like kids in front of Han Sen. The power he wielded was enough to scare the entire universe. Godfather Han became a new term in the universe.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of power was that?\u201d A Very High Elder frowned in thought. He was given the task of capturing Han Sen and returning him to the Very High. Because of Destroyed Leader\u2019s involvement, he did not go and take action. He waited until Han Sen turned Destroyed Leader into butterfly class and Burning Lamp into a commoner. Even the Very High Elder was shocked. He did not dare approach Han Sen.\n\nIn fact, it was not only the Very High feeling that way. Many elites were shocked by Han Sen\u2019s Xuan Yellow Sutra. No one dared to do anything.\n\nPlus, they were not sure that Han Sen was butterfly class because the Xuan Yellow Sutra was not enough to turn a true god into a commoner. He could make them drop a level for a temporary amount of time.\n\nIf Northern Light Alpha and the others had attacked Han Sen together, there was nothing Han Sen could not. They would have had to retreat far away.\n\nThey were shocked by what Han Sen could do already. Han Sen turning Burning Lamp into a commoner was too scary. They did not understand how powerful Han Sen was. No one dared to come and stop Han Sen from lighting up the crystallizer\u2019s lantern.\n\nHan Sen would have liked to get rid of Northern Light Alpha and the others, but he was not powerful enough to do that yet. It was already difficult for him to light up the race lantern.\n\n\u201cWho did the crystallizers offend before? Why would any elite want to try and stop the crystallizers from ascending their status?\u201d Han Sen did not understand.\n\nBack in the sanctuaries, Han Sen noticed the humans of the sanctuaries were not affected by the crystallizer\u2019s race lantern. He felt a bit relieved.\n\nHan Sen understood that the sanctuaries and the universe had different rules. The two places were not connected, but he was still worried.\n\nHe brought a human elite to the universe, and the human immediately generated an armament. He was made a Baron, and the crystallizer\u2019s race mark appeared on his forehead. After becoming a Baron, the race mark started to fade.\n\n\u201cOf course, after entering the big universe, you will be affected by the geno hall\u2019s rules,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nWith Space Garden as a base, Han Sen\u2019s power in the universe was already quite good. Han Sen did not need to worry about too much anymore. He brought as many xenogeneics, creatures, and humans to Space Garden as he could. They all used Space Garden\u2019s resources to quickly develop.\n\nMaking a race powerful was not something that could be done solely by one person. If he wanted humans to be powerful in the universe, he needed everyone to become stronger.\n\nIt was just Space Garden though. No matter how many resources there were, they could not become a top high race through them alone. Han Sen needed a hundred or a thousand xenogeneic spaces that were similar to Space Garden to compete to make humans and the others that supported Han Sen able to attack the high race.\n\nHan Sen was taking his first step forward, but it was the hardest step.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen no longer remained in Space Garden. Although it had many resources, they were just primitive xenogeneic plants. It was not enough to support the growth of butterfly elites, such as Han Sen.\n\nIt was not just Han Sen. Even Huangfu Jing, who was larva class, needed to find more resources to keep leveling up.\n\nHan Sen was hesitant, but he decided to use Holy Baby\u2019s identity to return to the Extreme King. He needed to be there so he could become a true god faster.\n\nThe real Holy Baby was stuck in Space Garden. Holy Baby was being very honest. He spent some time with the Six-Ear Macaque. He had been following Bao\u2019er a lot. He kept calling Bao\u2019er \u201cSister Bao\u2019er\u201d to make her feel good.\n\nHan Sen did not know what went on while he was away, but he knew Holy Baby was suppressed by Bao\u2019er.\n\nHan Ling\u2019er\u2019s forehead had the crystallizer mark on it, but she was the same as Bao\u2019er. She had not leveled up. Han Sen, who lit up the lantern, was very much the same. He had not leveled up either. He only received a few benefits via his genes.\n\nHan Sen again used the Four Sheep Cube as a springboard. He successfully used the Holy Baby\u2019s identity to infiltrate Nine-Defense Palace. He was planning to go and see Time Ghost at palace number 0002.\n\nTime Ghost was a deified class xenogeneic. If he was able to kill it, it would help fill up Han Sen\u2019s deified genes. It would make it easier for him to become true god. Han Sen was thinking about how to become true god. He used the Sky God Crown to look inside the geno hall and see if there was any difference.\n\nHe went to the palace that held Time Ghost inside, who was still sitting. It was retrained by the traps, but it did not look as if it wanted to move or even look at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen knew the xenogeneics there had their spirits removed. Although their spirits could be reborn, they were trapped there for a long time. Their new spirits seemed to be weak. Their intelligence was very low.\n\nHan Sen drew his Sky Vine Radish God Lance and thrust it at Time Ghost. Time Ghost seemed to feel the power inside the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, so it opened its eyes and looked at the lance heading straight for him.\n\nA power was emerging from Time Ghost. One could not even see how it spread. The tip of the Sky Vine Radish God Lance was going to pierce Time Ghost\u2019s chest, but that small distance suddenly seemed enormous. Han Sen was striking for a long time, but the tip had yet to reach Time Ghost\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cTime power?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. In the binding of the restraints, Time Ghost was still able to make use of powerful time powers. It was no wonder it was considered a top-class time element xenogeneic."
