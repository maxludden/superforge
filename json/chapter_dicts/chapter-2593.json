    "text": "\u201cIt sounds like you know something about the Charming God\u2019s Jian, but do you know what power it has?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart leaped at the possibility. Meng Lie might be able to tell him the type of power the purple copper jian possessed.\n\nMeng Lie looked at Han Sen as if he knew what he was thinking. But he still said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you will be disappointed. The Charming God\u2019s Jian is the strongest race weapon in existence, and it is also the weakest race weapon in existence. It is strong because it has the power to supercharge a person\u2019s charm. The Fox alpha used it to attract everyone. If it was used well, it could make a thousand races obey that alpha. I also say it is weak because its powers of simple destruction are bad. It won\u2019t help you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you are saying it has no attack power? And therefore, it is useless?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe him.\n\nHe fired at Meng Lie. A shockwave was created in space, and with it, the purple copper jian disappeared.\n\nWhen Han Sen had used the purple copper jian to defeat the monster in the Black Hole Spider\u2019s belly, it had revealed its true strength. Han Sen didn\u2019t believe it lacked destructive powers. Pang!\n\nWhen Han Sen\u2019s attack reappeared, Meng Lie slashed at the jian. His strike came against the purple copper jian.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed. Both of his hands moved to grab the purple copper jian, but the weapon\u2019s power was still active. Han Sen tried his hardest to hold its grip, but the purple copper jian struck his chest. He was sent flying, like an asteroid striking a planet. He was pinned to a mountain. Han Sen lowered his head and looked at the purple copper jian in his chest. That jian had previously pierced through Meng Lie\u2019s chest, but he didn\u2019t expect karma would repay the same strike so soon.\n\nHan Sen clutched the handle of the jian and tried to pull it out. But before he could use any strength, Meng Lie\u2019s gold, godly body appeared. He attacked with his gold lion head knife. His scary gold knife light looked like it was going to cut the planet in half.\n\nThe little red bird screeched like a phoenix. The fire in its mouth became a sea of angry flames that rained down on Meng Lie. It tried to stop Meng Lie casting that knife light to destroy Han Sen.\n\nBut the little red bird was still only primitive, and the knife in Meng Lie\u2019s right hand had the same level of power. His right hand turned that power into a shield that covered the sky. It extinguished the little red bird\u2019s fire.\n\nSeeing this, Miss Mirror sighed. \u201cIn the end, Han Sen still needs to die. It would have been okay if he had just killed Bai Yi. He might have still been allowed to live. But now that he has the true god Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze and the race weapon of the Fox. He must die.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nA scary gold knife light appeared, and the whole planet exploded. The destruction caused by the gold knife light was so bright that the entire galaxy shone with its radiance. Shockwaves washed through the system.\n\n\u201cHan Sen.\u201d Yisha was engaged with Miss Mirror, so she couldn\u2019t go and help. When she saw that explosion of power, her face fell. \u201cCaptain! It is all over.\u201d Far away, inside the white whale, all of the pirates were shocked. Their faces looked cold.\n\nEven a deified would have died if they were hit by that much power. Plus, Han Sen wasn\u2019t deified. He only used treasures of that class.\n\nThe pirates were thinking about whether or not they should kneel and beg. If they did, they might be permitted to live. On the other hand, the captured Extreme King knights inside the white whale were delighted.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is dead. You guys are next!\u201d one of the Extreme King knights said menacingly to a pirate.\n\nena\n\nSlap! The Extreme King knight who said that was smacked to the floor. Bao\u2019er then went to clean her hand, as if she had touched something dirty.\n\nThe Extreme King knight was rolling around on the floor, clutching his injured face. His teeth had been broken and his jaw had been shattered.\n\nThe other Extreme King knights didn\u2019t say anything more. They had almost forgotten that the little demon was still onboard the ship.\n\nBao\u2019er looked at the Extreme King knights. They all lowered their heads, not daring to meet her gaze.\n\n\u201cMy Dad won\u2019t die,\u201d Bao\u2019er said with disdain. Then, she looked back out into space.\n\nThe Extreme King knights didn\u2019t say anything to the contrary, but they thought to themselves, \u201cHan Sen only has a few deified weapons. How could he possibly compete with Meng Lie? He will be dead. And up next will be you, you little demon.\u201dAfter a while, the power shining around the wreckage of the planet began to dim. And then, Fang Qing Yu suddenly shouted, \u201cHan Sen isn\u2019t dead!\u201d The pirates and the Extreme King knights looked over there. They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. They saw Han Sen suspended in space, holding a shield that had protected his body. Due to the fact that the planet had exploded, his armor and feathers were a little blackened. But he hadn\u2019t been badly wounded.\n\nThe worst wound he had was the wound delivered by the purple copper jian, which was in his chest.\n\n\u201cI forgot you have the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, but the Medusa\u2019s Gaze isn\u2019t a race weapon. It isn\u2019t smart enough. It won\u2019t follow your orders, and you cannot use it like the Charming God\u2019s Jian. It would be annoying if it did.\u201d Meng Lie\u2019s eyes were on fire as he looked down at the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze.\n\nHan Sen coughed, and a trickle of blood spilled over his lips. He looked at Meng Lie coldly and said, \u201cAre you sure I cannot use it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze was the true god weapon of the alpha of the Ghana,\u201d Meng Lie said with a sneer. \u201cBack then, it was a deified weapon that was in the top ten in existence. Its power was comparable to the Ghana\u2019s race weapon Purgatory Heaven. But there is a big difference between true god weapons and race weapons. Race weapons are their own life forms, in a way. They can think for themselves and make judgments. If they approve of a user, then the user can still activate their power, even if the creature\u2019s level is low. But true god weapons are different. Without true god powers, you cannot make use of a true god weapon\u2019s power. If a low-level deified has the same element as the true god weapon, they can use a little of its power. But you aren\u2019t deified, and your power isn\u2019t compatible with the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. So, you cannot activate its power. You cannot tap into 1/10,000th of its power. You can only use it as an ordinary shield.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze is a shield. Despite that, its power doesn\u2019t lie in defense,\u201d Meng Lie said all of this, and then he generated a scary gold power. The gold lion head knife now possessed a god light that shocked the whole world. It was like the universe was going to be cut in half by this god light.\n\nSeeing that Meng Lie was going to unleash that knife light, Han Sen\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. He still held the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze tight. As he watched that seemingly all-powerful knife light form, the power in his body madly rushed into the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze.\n\nThere was a weird, pretty-looking woman carved atop the shield. Suddenly, a light appeared in her closed eyes."
