    "text": "The light symbol hummed on Han Sen\u2019s hand like an energy converter. When Han Sen sent power into the light symbol, his energy was transformed into sealing power.\n\nGreen Dragon, White Tiger, Red Bird, and Black Turtle. Four beasts made up the symbols, and Han Sen was represented by the Red Bird. As his power flowed into the symbol, the symbol swirled around in his hand like a flaming bird.\n\nMister White stepped in front of one xenogeneic clone and directed Han Sen, Crime, and the blood kirin to stand on either side of and behind the creature.\n\nThis was a powerful seal that normally required many people to do what they were attempting to. It wouldn\u2019t be an easy task in the midst of combat, that was for sure. Usually, a person would use this technique to seal a creature that was already under their control. The technique took far too long to be useful in a fight.\n\nFortunately, the xenogeneic clone wasn\u2019t going to attack them during their free day. It stood there, unmoving, increasing their chances of sealing it successfully.\n\nThe first attempt went smoothly. Han Sen and the others surrounded the xenogeneic from four different directions. They weren\u2019t attacked, and the xenogeneic simply stood there looking at them.\n\nMister White waved at Han Sen and the others, indicating they should rest a little. It was still early in the day, after all. If they fully committed to the sealing right then, they\u2019d be wasting some of their strength. They needed to seal the creature at the last moment possible in order to save every smidgen of energy they had.\n\nAfter a minute of thought, Han Sen said, \u201cSince they aren\u2019t attacking us now, why don\u2019t we at least try the sealing to see if it works?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trust Mister White? Even if the seal doesn\u2019t work, do you have another way out of this?\u201d Crime asked in a cold voice.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with giving it a try,\u201d Han Sen responded flatly.\n\nMister White nodded. \u201cOkay, then let us try. It will be a useful practice run.\u201d\n\nFollowing Mister White\u2019s command, Han Sen and the others cast the Four Symbols Seal. The symbol of the red bird shivered on Han Sen\u2019s hand. He felt a connection form between the bird and Mister White\u2019s white tiger, Crime\u2019s black turtle, and the green dragon that hovered around the blood kirin\u2019s claws.\n\nAll those powers were transferred, and the Four Symbols Seal\u2019s light became stronger. The connection between them strengthened.\n\nThe four powers supported each other, and as the light rose, four giant shadows formed into a bai sema that trapped the creature inside.\n\nThe xenogeneic found itself confined within the bai sema. Its eyes flashed, and the enemy started to move.\n\n\u201cOh no! It is going to attack us. Seal the bai sema now!\u201d Mister White shouted loudly.\n\nThe four of them quickly finished casting the Four Symbols Seal. The shadows of the green dragon, the white tiger, the red bird, and the black turtle were cast onto the xenogeneic\u2019s body. The shadows bound the xenogeneic.\n\nThe xenogeneic kept moving as Han Sen and the others continued casting their seal. The four shadows kept seething across the xenogeneic. The xenogeneic tried to fight back, but it couldn\u2019t break the seal.\n\nCrime looked ill, and he said, \u201cI told you to trust Mister White, but you just had to try it! Now we\u2019ve wasted so much more of our power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We will just have to hold the seal and keep it going for the next ten days,\u201d Mister White said firmly, putting an end to Crime\u2019s complaining.\n\nHan Sen shrugged slightly and remained silent. He had known this was a possibility, but he thought they should give it a try anyway.\n\nAttempting the seal now would only anger one xenogeneic. If it failed, only one powerful creature would be trying to kill them. But if they failed closer to the end of the first day, they might end up being attacked by whole groups of the monsters.\n\nSo, Han Sen would rather spend a bit more energy now than risk everything later on.\n\nAside from the struggling xenogeneic in the seal, the other xenogeneics just maintained their stances and their expressionless stares. When Han Sen\u2019s group confirmed that they weren\u2019t going to be attacked by the monsters around them, they felt greatly relieved.\n\nThe xenogeneic kept struggling. Although its power was sealed, it still had a deified body. Han Sen and the others had to use all their power to hold the seal against the raw, physical strength of the creature\u2019s thrashing.\n\nMister White and the blood kirin were half-deified, so they had an easier time. Crime was a top dog of the Kings, so he was holding up well, too.\n\nBut Han Sen had only just become a Duke. He hadn\u2019t been a Duke for very long, so his power was lacking in comparison to the others. He had to use all of his strength just to keep the red bird\u2019s symbol of light up.\n\nMister White looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cA Duke\u2019s element is separate from your original body\u2019s astral body and celestial body. Your original body is your own genes taking the form of an element. At that stage, you must use your own power to fight. At the second stage, your astral body needs to rely on the planet beneath you. Planetary powers can be used to aid the elements of your body. For instance, a water element Duke will perform much better on a water-based planet.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Mister White continued to say, \u201cThe celestial body you can access in the third stage is also known as your universal body. That body can use the power of the universe. As long as it is not separated from the universe for some reason, it has access to practically unlimited power.\u201d\n\nHan Sen understood what Mister White was talking about, but he had only just become a Duke. He only had his original body, so he couldn\u2019t make use of any external powers.\n\nPlus, even if he did gain a celestial body, he knew that Holy Town was separated from the outside world. He couldn\u2019t access any power that was outside the town.\n\nMister White knew what Han Sen was thinking, and so he smiled. \u201cJudging by the way you use your body, you must still be at the first stage. You only have your original body. I have an original body geno art that might be able to help you. Perhaps you could learn it in order to ascend more easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are really willing to teach me, I would be very grateful.\u201d Han Sen was surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected Mister White to volunteer to teach him a geno art, and he wasn\u2019t sure what the sudden offer meant.\n\n\u201cMister White, why do you care about him!\u201d Crime exclaimed unhappily.\n\nMister White smiled. \u201cWe are cooperating to maintain the seal, aren\u2019t we? We are all in this together. Han Sen is of a lower level than us, so he will have a hard time over the course of the next ten days. If anything happens to him, we will all be destroyed. I am only doing this for myself.\u201d\n\nAfter Mister White said that, Crime fell silent.\n\nMister White paused for a moment before speaking. \u201cMy geno art isn\u2019t very impressive. I made it myself, and I never did think up a name for it. It hasn\u2019t been presented anywhere. I\u2019ll explain it as best I can, and if you think it helps, you can use it. If it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIn a quiet voice, Mister White gave a straightforward explanation of the geno art. Crime and the blood kirin focused on his words as well.\n\nCrime listened seriously. Just like Mister White said, his geno art seemed rather simple. Even so, it was obviously quite special. Despite its simplicity, it was incredibly difficult to understand.\n\n\u201cMister White, your geno art is so complicated. I am afraid he won\u2019t be able to understand it,\u201d Crime said after hearing Mister White\u2019s geno art."
