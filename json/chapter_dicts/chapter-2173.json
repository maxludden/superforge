    "text": "The tadpoles bathed in the glow of the moonlight, happily absorbing every ounce of the light they were receiving from the moon.\n\nNow, Han Sen understood how the guardian benefitted. When the deified toad spat out moons, everything would freeze. Even the light stilled. The creatures and people around would not know what was occurring, save for the guardian with the tablet for protection. Only the guardian would witness the moons and share the moonlight.\n\nThe moonlight was very useful for one\u2019s body. That was because the moonlight enhanced genes and increased fitness. That sort of growth was very rare but widely beneficial. Even Kings had to level up their fitness, after all.\n\nThere was one more benefit that was even better for Han Sen, who was now the guardian. Since he had practiced with ice powers, he could absorb the deified toad\u2019s cold air. By doing that, his Jadeskin would level up far faster.\n\nHe could use the first day of the month to absorb cold powers, while on day fifteen, he could bask in the glow of the moonlight. Han Sen\u2019s only disappointment was in the fact that the two days went far too quickly, and he could only enjoy each of these opportunities once a month. Han Sen wanted to hunt Dukes in his free time, but in Narrow Moon, Duke xenogeneics were very rare. And furthermore, they were mostly under the control of someone or something King class. He couldn\u2019t go around killing Dukes as he pleased.\n\nSo, Han Sen planned to embark on some missions. By completing the missions, he could kill Dukes on the way and collect the Duke genes he wanted.\n\nHan Sen thought that those genes, aside from leveling up the body\u2019s fitness, would also have another use. He just hadn\u2019t yet found out what that was.\n\nBefore Han Sen took the next mission, however, he received some fairly shocking news.\n\nA traitor of the Destroyed had fled into the area and gone to hide somewhere in the Six Star xenogeneic space. The Six Star xenogeneic space was a xenogeneic space that belonged to the Rebate.\n\nThe Destroyed was requesting that the Rebate seal up the Six Star xenogeneic space to keep him there.\n\nBut for some reason, many other races had sent some of their people to the Six Star xenogeneic space. They proclaimed they had sent teams to protect their members who had already entered that xenogeneic space. But it seemed as if they were more interested in the traitor of the Destroyed. The teams entered, but they never left.\n\nAccording to outside sources, it was whispered that the traitor of the Destroyed had stolen one of their treasures. That was why there was a big fuss about all this.\n\nBecause the Six Star xenogeneic space was an open business place of the Rebate, many of the races went there. But even though so many teams had entered, quite strangely, the Destroyed traitor had yet to be located. Where he might have been hiding, no one seemed to know.\n\nHan Sen was interested in this little affair. He perused what information he was allowed to view, and he came to learn that the Six Star xenogeneic space was quite popular right now. Many elites were headed there, and many teams comprised of Marquises and Dukes went there in an effort to find the traitor.\n\nMany King class elites were sitting outside the place. That was one of the conditions of locking down the Six Star xenogeneic space. The Rebate didn\u2019t want too many elites poking about the xenogeneic space, as they didn\u2019t want the news to become too big. That was a xenogeneic space belonging to the Rebate, and so if something was to happen, it would be on them.\n\nThere weren\u2019t that many Kings anyway, so there weren\u2019t many participating in the teams that went in to search.\n\nRight now, the Six Star xenogeneic space would only allow entry and not exit. The Destroyed really wanted to find that traitor, and they didn\u2019t care what it took.\n\nOther races tried to search for the traitor, too. Or find the treasure he had stolen from the Destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhat did he steal from the Destroyed, to bring the attention of so many different factions?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself. He planned to go to the Six Star xenogeneic space to see for himself.\n\nBut Han Sen wasn\u2019t interested in looking for the traitor of the Destroyed. Many factions were already looking for him, and even many Marquises and Dukes that belonged to Narrow Moon were out in search of him. If Han Sen went in alone, the chances of finding the traitor before everyone else were practically zero.\n\nHan Sen was going to the Six Star xenogeneic space because it was now open. Even the xenogeneics that populated that space were up for grabs. So, Han Sen fancied hunting down some Duke xenogeneics to collect their genes.\n\nHan Sen messaged Zero, Han Meng\u2019er, Little Angel, Bao\u2019er, Little Invisible, Little Silver, and Little Star, asking them all to meet at the Six Star xenogeneic space.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived, however, things quickly appeared to be worse than he initially thought. Moon Wheel King and the other Kings were there, and they were controlling the traffic of the elites that were allowed in.\n\nThe Six Star xenogeneic space\u2019s interior was a bit of a mess, too, as many of the Marquises and Dukes that were looking for the Destroyed traitor began to fight. Many of them died in the clashes.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, this situation is too complex. You should not go, in case something bad happens to you.\u201d Black Moon King, who was guarding the exit, tried to convince Han Sen.\n\nAlthough many King class elites were blocking the way in, there were still many powerful Dukes in there. They were a whole level higher than Han Sen, which would make things very dangerous for a Marquise.\n\nHan Sen appreciated Black Moon King\u2019s concern, but he still took Zero, Little Angel, and the others in with him.\n\nHe had his Demon Bug Bai Sema, so not even a King class enemy was going to scare him. And if they didn\u2019t scare him, the Dukes certainly wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHe had four Demon Bug Bai Semas, and Han Sen chose to hold one of them himself. The other three were given to Han Meng\u2019er, Zero, and Little Angel. Bao\u2019er and Little Silver were always with Han Sen, so they could share his.\n\nThe Six Star xenogeneic space, in terms of size, was pretty average. That being said, the landscape was very complicated. Aside from the six planets that existed there, there were many asteroids.\n\nFinding a Marquise inside the asteroid belts would be very difficult.\n\nThe stories of the traitor Marquise said he was very good when it came to living in space. He could last in space for a few years without needing to eat or drink.\n\nSo, many of the races compartmentalized their search radiuses and slowly locked down each area in which the traitor might have been hiding.\n\nHan Sen did not search amidst the asteroids, though. He brought his companions to one of the planets. The one selected was called Planet Sodi. It had many xenogeneics, and many of them were Dukes. That was why Han Sen wanted to go there in the first place.\n\nPeople were used to paying large sums of money to hunt xenogeneics on Planet Sodi, but with the mess going on right now, the Rebate couldn\u2019t enforce the tolls and so anyone could come and go.\n\nHan Sen took his companions there, too, saving a lot of money in the process.\n\nHan Sen had only just entered Planet Sodi when he was given a shock. Many people had been planning to do the same thing as him. People had spread all over the planet as they hunted xenogeneics.\n\n\u201cThis is obscene! How can they take advantage of a situation like this?\u201d Han Sen demanded angrily. He had totally forgotten he was there for the same reason."
