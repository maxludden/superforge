    "text": "Han Sen was incredibly overjoyed, watching his space king spirit geno point tally increase one-by-one.\n\nSplit-Space King, before it was all over, became numb. Eventually, he gave up completely. Whenever he respawned, he stood there silently, awaiting death. Again and again, he allowed this to happen.\n\n\u201cOh my spirit! The King is terrifying. What element does he wield?\u201d\n\n\u201cPhysical, maybe? But if that is true, can plain, physical power even reach such heights?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless someone has more gene locks open, The King is unbeatable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe King won\u2019t be a king much longer. He is sure to become an emperor!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the sort of spirit that will bring great change to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe King is indestructible.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe quiet chattering between the spirits soon turned into a frenzy of praise and fawning, and whenever they looked at The King, their faces fell slack in complete awe and admiration of him.\n\nBoom!\n\nAfter killing Split-Space King ninety-nine times, Han Sen\u2019s space geno point tally reached a hundred. He couldn\u2019t increase it anymore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone up against many king spirits in my time here, and still, none are able to defeat me. Is this to continue forever?!\u201d Han Sen spoke aloud and put on an expression of disappointment. Then he turned to leave.\n\n\u201cOnly The King can say something like this. And to be honest, he has every right to.\u201d The spirits all looked on him in amazement.\n\nHan Sen did not really mean what he said. His primary goal was to provoke the ire and hatred of the other spirits even more, and perhaps draw out another challenger. Unfortunately, none were willing to.\n\nUnexpectedly, the spirits all agreed with his words and deemed them appropriate.\n\n\u201cThese spirits are lame. Humans are fearless; they wouldn\u2019t act like this,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Split-Space King was unable to defeat The King.\u201d Flower Empress was in shock.\n\n\u201cIf nothing stops him, he\u2019s well on his way to becoming an Emperor. He\u2019s got the makings of a spirit that\u2019ll reach the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, without error,\u201d Heavenly Empress said.\n\n\u201cThe Emperors have had no luck so far, but they won\u2019t relent in their pursuit of him. And when they do find The King, they\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Flower Empress spoke with a soft and worried tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is necessarily true. If they find out where he is, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll be able to do much,\u201d Heavenly Empress commented.\n\n\u201cI wonder who is parents are. I\u2019d sure like to meet them!\u201d Flower Empress said.\n\n\u201cYou want to be their daughter-in-law? You\u2019re thinking that far ahead, are you?\u201d Heavenly Empress jested with a laugh.\n\nFlower Empress said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no denying it\u2019d be great if I could marry a spirit such as that. The baby we\u2019d conceive would be something quite special, for sure. And regardless of that, I still owe him kisses!\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nMoment Queen had been sent out to retrieve creatures, and when she entered the spirit base, she heard the news.\n\n\u201cWhoa! That sounds like a scary spirit. I wonder where he came from?\u201d Moment Queen did not think highly of herself, and she did not even reckon she could defeat space king spirits of her own tier.\n\nAfter hearing the tale of The King, she thought to herself, \u201cIf I can ally with him, I can most certainly exact my revenge! Hmm, but I\u2019ve only opened one gene lock\u2026 I doubt I\u2019ll be able to catch up with him.\u201d\n\nWhen the image of Han Sen\u2019s smug face flickered across her mind, Moment Queen said to herself, \u201cUgh, this is that asshole\u2019s fault! If it wasn\u2019t for him, I\u2019d have opened a multitude of gene locks a long time ago. When the time for my revenge comes, I won\u2019t just kill him. No, that\u2019d be too merciful. I\u2019m going to enslave him. I\u2019ll make him my thrall!\u201d\n\nMoment Queen did not know The King was Han Sen, the person she hated most in all the world.\n\nAs this was occurring, Han Sen was dining on a meal Zero had prepared. At the same time, he fiddled with the scale.\n\nWith Moment Queen\u2019s fruitful hunt, Han Sen no longer had to worry about mutant geno points. All he had to do was eat his fill.\n\nBut the dragon scale troubled Han Sen.\n\nThere were many small words inscribed upon it, and he had no clue what they meant. Dragon King told him it was a transcript of his own secret skills.\n\nBut Han Sen did not believe this, and he found it difficult to imagine someone randomly carving their skills out on such a unique scale.\n\nWhen Han Sen pestered Dragon King for a more profound explanation, he translated the text for him. But due to Han Sen not being able to understand the source text, he couldn\u2019t be sure whether or not to trust the translation.\n\nAnd still, Han Sen believed he was lying. He asked Thorn Baron and Moment Queen what they thought, and they both told him the same thing: the words on the scale were not written in any spirit language.\n\nHan Sen then went to do some research, and he found a few languages that possessed similar runic systems to the ones on the scale.\n\nAfter a deeper analysis, Han Sen was surprised to discover an exact match with a shura language.\n\nHan Sen had learnt how to read, write, and speak the shura language. But he had learned a modern variant of the language. The dialect written across the scale was ancient, and it was almost entirely different.\n\nNot wanting to jump the gun, Han Sen spent some time with his research and was careful to confirm his findings. It wasn\u2019t long before he realized he really wasn\u2019t mistaken. The text on the scale belonged to an ancient shura writing system; it was prehistoric.\n\nIt was a shocking discovery, to say the least. The shura could not enter the sanctuaries, so why in the universe would their runes be inscribed on the scale?\n\nHan Sen attempted a translation with his computer, but there was little he could uncover. Although there were a few words here and there the system could translate, not a single sentence could be completed.\n\nAt the very least, Han Sen had now learnt that whatever had been written upon the scale was not one of Dragon King\u2019s skills. And when he translated a word that was clearly the title of the text, it read: Asura."
