He looked down at the bugs all around him and asked, \u201cCan you guys hear me?\u201d\n\nThere was no response. And while Han Sen looked at them all in confusion, a beetle leaped into flight and hovered before him. It made a queer noise before turning around and flying off towards the old, decayed city.\n\nHan Sen continued to stand still, unsure of what was going on. After a while, that same beetle returned and started to fly around him. From what he could tell, this was the beetle\u2019s way of telling him to hurry up.\n\nHan Sen nibbled his lips and decided to follow it.\n\nSince he was there, he thought he might as well poke about the old city and see what he could find. If the beetles sought to do harm, surely they would have attacked him by now.\n\nAnd judging from their current posture of praise or worship, Han Sen was positive that wouldn\u2019t change anytime soon.\n\nAfter Han Sen started moving, the other beetles paced behind him diligently. They followed his every footstep, like the coming and going of a tide.\n\nBefore long, Han Sen had made his way into the city center. Everything there was in crumbling ruin, all except for one thing: a temple. This peculiar temple was immaculate and untouched.\n\nThe flying beetle landed on the temple\u2019s stairs and made a noise to Han Sen, indicating he should continue following it and go inside.\n\nHan Sen scaled the stairs, but the beetles did not follow. They all knelt as he ascended, and looked exuberantly happy.\n\nHan Sen summoned beast soul armor, pushed open the door to the temple, and stepped inside. The place was old, and dust caked each and every surface.\n\nThe temple was devoid of statues, but there were a few dings about. Curiously, they were all empty.\n\nAs Han Sen looked into a corner of the temple, he was shocked to find a crystal vase there.\n\nHan Sen could tell that the vase was not built from ordinary crystal. It had instead been forged from a unique variety of crystal, laden with symbols that looked like machine parts or cogs.\n\nFinding curious items and artifacts inside a crystallizer ruin was par for the course, but this vase particularly surprised Han Sen.\n\nIt was completely transparent, but its shape and form were stark and unmissable.\n\nHan Sen went to look inside the vase and was even more surprised to see a woman inside it.\n\nThe girl was sitting at the bottom, hugging her knees. She had blonde hair, but Han Sen could not see her face.\n\nThere were no shura horns to be seen, and she had human ears, but she was naked.\n\nThe long blonde hair helped to dress some of her exposed parts, though.\n\n\u201cHuman? Is she one of the missing researchers?\u201d Han Sen looked at the woman in the vase and wondered who she might be. Instinct told him that she was very young, though, and she couldn\u2019t have been a researcher if that was true.\n\nHan Sen knew that two humans and two shura had gone inside the ruins to explore before their arrival, but only one of each had come back.\n\nIf the girl was one of those researchers, he wasn\u2019t going to just ignore her.\n\nHan Sen then noticed the vase was sealed, and not with a lid. The whole thing was complete.\n\nThe crystallizers had strange technology, and their creations were always unique. This had always been true, so this vase\u2019s structure was not exactly a surprise.\n\nHan Sen spoke with a soft voice, gently asking, \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\n\nHe received no response, so he asked with a louder voice. Again, he received no response. He asked several times, with a voice that became louder each time. It seemed as if she couldn\u2019t hear him.\n\nHan Sen touched the vase with care, unsure of what might happen. Fortunately, nothing out of the ordinary occurred.\n\nWhen he felt safer in its presence, Han Sen started to knock against it.\n\nThe girl seemed to hear that, and showed a reaction. After seeing her move slightly, Han Sen knocked again.\n\nShe woke up and looked around for the knocking noise, and that was also when Han Sen saw what she looked like in full. She seemed to be around eighteen years old, and she was ravishingly pretty. Curiously, her eyes were the same golden color as her hair.\n\nJudging from her appearance, she seemed to be a human girl.\n\nHan Sen again thought she might indeed be the human researcher. Her appearance did not betray this notion, as even forty-year-olds could maintain the same beauty and grace as an eighteen-year-old in that day and age.\n\nWhen the girl saw Han Sen there, her eyes blinked to get a clearer view, as if she had indeed just woken up.\n\nShe stood up and beat against the vase. Her mouth moved, as if she were saying something, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\nAll Han Sen could do was read her lips, and from what he could tell, she was saying, \u201cSave me.\u201d\n\nHe brought out a paper and pen and wrote down a few words he could show her.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d He wrote, wanting to learn about her identity.\n\nHan Sen had to be wary and maintain vigilance at all times. You could never guess what tricks or traps might be waiting for a person inside crystallizer ruins.\n\nThe lady blew air onto the cold crystal of the vase and wrote, \u201cSunset, of Blue Blood Special Forces. Rank: Colonel.\u201d\n\nThis confirmed to Han Sen that she must have been one of the researchers, and now it looked as if she had been trapped there.\n\n\u201cStand back; I\u2019ll break the crystal,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\nAcknowledging what he wrote, Sunset took a step back."
