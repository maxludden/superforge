You are going to die, so give me the relic and speak your last words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, is this about Immortal Emperor sacrificing the whole tree? That\u2019s old news,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBaby Ghost looked as if he\u2019d swallowed a bug, and in utter shock, he gasped, \u201cHow do you know about that!?\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and looked coy. He didn\u2019t answer him, and instead said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the specifics, but tell me: what makes you think you and Qing Jun will be spared?\u201d\n\nBaby Ghost was still in shock over the fact Han Sen knew what was going on, and he answered, \u201cQing Jun is Immortal Emperor\u2019s daughter. And me? I\u2019m the one who concocted this scheme!\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, I see. So, have you been avoiding the consumption of lifewater?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cWhat does the lifewater have to do with anything?\u201d Baby Ghost asked, but right after, his mind seemed to get snagged on a sudden, disturbing thought.\n\n\u201cWhoever has been drinking the lifewater will be sacrificed. There\u2019s no particular discrimination, as it\u2019s a catch-all type of thing.\u201d Han Sen was extra smug, rubbing it in. He could tell Baby Ghost had been drinking the lifewater.\n\nBaby Ghost\u2019s facial expression was beyond distraught, and so he said, \u201cImpossible! Qing Jun has been using lifewater as well. Who has been feeding you these lies!?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let me ask you: have you been told how these sacrifices are to be\u2026 well, sacrificed?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBaby Ghost looked clueless. He wished to speak, but he seemed to be struggling to force out words. His face turned green at the sudden turn of events, and all his throat could end up spitting out were the words, \u201cH-have I been tr-tricked!?\u201d\n\nAfter that Baby Ghost turned to run, but Han Sen stopped him.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to consult the emperor with this, you\u2019re a dead baby. Tell me about the relationship between Han Jingzhi and Blood Legion,\u201d Han Sen told him.\n\nBaby Ghost said, \u201cI don\u2019t fully believe your forked tongue. Not yet, leastways. I must go and\u2026 confirm something.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You tell me what I want to know now.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think Baby Ghost would ever come back, once he left.\n\nBaby Ghost then answered, \u201cGah, but it\u2019s a long story! The short version is, something huge happened within the Legion. We needed help. Han Jingzhi was then kidnapped by Blood Legion forces.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. The revelations were coming thick and fast. There was a connection between Han Jingzhi and Blood Legion, but the way it came about was very unexpected. Han Jingzhi had actually been the victim of kidnapping.\n\nHan Sen wished to ask more, but Baby Ghost was already gone.\n\n\u201cHan Jingzhi was kidnapped by Blood Legion forces? That must mean he was there with them for some time, in some way or another. That might also mean he learned much about the organization, including the Nine-Life Cat. But why was he kidnapped? Why did they need to do that? Did they kidnap just anyone? Did it happen before or after he visited that realm with the maybe-a-god-maybe-a-demon being?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s mind was now wracked with countless more questions.\n\nHan Sen hoped Baby Ghost wouldn\u2019t be killed, so he could ask the spirit a bunch more questions.\n\nHan Sen was not too worried what he might do, though. If Han Sen was attacked and had to make an escape, he believed he could do so with the aid of Little Angel.\n\nA few days later, Qing Jun came looking for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was surprised to see her, and when she approached, she asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t drink the lifewater you were given?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Han Sen answered simply.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d Qing Jun handed something to Han Sen, turned around, and left as swiftly as she appeared. Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure why she had just done what she did, and truthfully, he fancied asking her a few questions.\n\nIt seemed like Baby Ghost had told Qing Jun what Han Sen had told him.\n\nShe had given Han Sen a small bottle with a piece of paper attached.\n\nThe paper said the contract on Qiu Ping had been forfeit. Han Sen had long wondered how he might get Qing Jun to let Qiu Ping go free, and now, it had been done without any effort on his part.\n\nHan Sen was delighted, so he left the worksite. He wanted to visit Qiu Ping and guide him out. Han Sen thought someone might stop him, but no one did. He scanned the nearby area and then realized the king spirits and super creatures were all gone.\n\nHan Sen returned to the fourth floor without issue and escorted Qiu Ping out of the tree. When Han Sen returned to the underground shelter with him, he noticed all the walnut trees in the forest were dying.\n\n\u201cBaby Ghost must have done something to make the Sky Tree revive even sooner!\u201d Dragon King exclaimed.\n\nHan Sen frowned and flew back towards the Sky Tree. As he was returning, he saw countless creatures writhing on the forest floor in agony. You could see their lifeforces being pulled from their bodies, heading for the tree that contained Immortal Shelter.\n\nGreen sprouts began to grow from their corpses, becoming vines that absorbed their flesh.\n\nSeeing all the creatures become fertilizer, Han Sen could not help but think, \u201cDragon King was right. Creatures that have consumed walnuts or lifewater are being absorbed no matter where they are.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen arrived back, though, a scary presence startled him on the approach. A black and red tree was growing incredibly quickly, heading high up into the clouds.\n\nThere was this a menacing spire in the land now, surrounded by countless dried up trees and creature corpses. Even the ground and earth were being sucked dry of life, transforming the area into an apocalyptic hellscape."
