    "text": "The fat squad leader became slightly pale. There had been many great soldiers who had tried the device and failed, so Wang Hou was clearly bringing the cookhouse up to set them up. However, there was no way the fat squad leader could argue with that.\n\nAfter hearing Wang Hou\u2019s words, Chen Shoushan looked at the fat squad leader and said with a smile, \"That is right. Luo, you are having a lot of fun just now, so it\u2019s time for you to move around. I think you have a great team, so you will definitely do well.\"\n\n\"Yes, captain.\" The fat squad leader stood up and saluted, cursing Wang Hou inwardly.\n\nAlthough everyone in the cookhouse was an evolver with high ranks, they were not the best fighters, because that\u2019s not what they did.\n\nThey were only there to see other people train but did not expect to be set up by Wang Hou.\n\nAlthough the fat squad leader wanted to go himself, the rule regulated that no team leads shall participate. In addition, with his round figure, he would probably lose even worse if he were to participate.\n\nThe fat squad leader looked to his team members and received pleading looks, meaning they were not confident at all.\n\n\"Fatty, isn\u2019t there a new recruit in your cookhouse? Let him make an appearance. It doesn\u2019t matter what the result is. We just want to meet him.\" As the fat squad leader was hesitating whom to pick, Wang Hou spoke again.\n\nAfter that day, Wang Hou looked through Han Sen\u2019s profile. He did not see anything special about Han Sen. The greatest strength about the sky was probably the fact that he graduated with the rank of major.\n\nHowever, that rank was nothing special on Daphne. Many soldiers had that rank and they were all more experienced than this new recruit, since a new recruit was unlikely to be assigned to this post.\n\nA mission like this required veterans. For Han Sen, who had just graduated from the military school, it was abnormal for him to be assigned to this place.\n\nWang Hou looked into Han Sen\u2019s background a bit further and found he graduated from the same school as Ji Yanran. The two must have known each other.\n\nNaturally, Han Sen was counted as Ji Yanran\u2019s fervent by Wang Hou. He wondered how strong a fighter Han Sen was. Wang Hou had always thought he should take every chance to know his enemy better.\n\nThe fat squad leader frowned and wanted to say something. However, Han Sen said calmly, \"It\u2019s okay. I can try. I want to anyway.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The fat squad leader did not stop Han Sen. After all, this was not a real drill. Since no one had succeeded, it was simply normal for Han Sen to fail as well. And worst case he would get shocked, which was nothing to a soldier.\n\nHan Sen got up, shot a glance at Wang Hou, and entered the training field.\n\nAlthough Daphne only had one warframe department, it was an advanced department comprised of fifteen warframe soldiers, who were all carefully selected veterans.\n\nBasically, except for the cookhouse, every other department was elite units. For example, the warship crew had a lot of groups such as the repair group and others.\n\nHan Sen entered the training field, and the gravity trainer was turned up. He suddenly felt a lot more burden.\n\nEveryone\u2019s eyes were suddenly on Han Sen. Although they all knew this new recruit would fail, it was fun to predict when he would fail.\n\nIn addition to Wang Hou, some other people were also observing Han Sen with scrutiny.\n\nJi Yanran did not manage to hide the fact that she was the one who got Han Sen on the warship from Chen Shoushan. The fact that Chen Shoushan was helping Wang Hou get Han Sen up the stage was because he was also wondering what Han Sen could do to make Ji Yanran spend so much effort.\n\nHan Sen took a deep breath and walked to the first metal wall.\n\nHan Sen had asked Ji Yanran about Wang Hou in private, because as sensitive as he was, he could feel the hostility Wang Hou held against himself.\n\nThat was abnormal. Han Sen was merely a new recruit and had not offended Wang Hou ever. He had not even met Wang Hou before. Han Sen did not feel that the hostility simply came from the bump.\n\nWhat Ji Yanran told Han Sen corroborated Han Sen\u2019s assumption.\n\nWang Hou was connected to the expert panel. Although he was the head of the warframe department, he was elected because of the suggestion of the expert panel. Wang Hou himself had selected all the soldiers in his department. It was fair to say that the warframe department worked for the expert panel.\n\nThere were many scholars and experts pissed at Ji Yanran, which was a known fact. After all, Ji Yanran had just become an evolver. Although she came from a prominent family, that did not help the fieldwork, which was why the expert panel did not like her very much.\n\nIn addition, the old Captain whom Ji Yanran had replaced was very close to the expert panel, so that had also added to the prejudice the expert panel held against Ji Yanran.\n\nBecause of Ji Yanran\u2019s family, no one dared to say anything. However, if Ji Yanran herself made some serious mistakes, it would be natural for her to be removed from Daphne.\n\nInitially, Han Sen did not want any drama, and only want to finish his tasks while improving himself. However, since he was here because of Ji Yanran, many people would know that. If he acted poorly, Ji Yanran would be humiliated.\n\nIt was not an option for his girlfriend to be humiliated. Not just that, he needed to make her proud. Otherwise, he would not call himself her boyfriend.\n\nHan Sen knew very well what Wang Hou was trying to do, but he did not care.\n\n\"You want to watch, I\u2019ll let you watch.\" Han Sen made the first step on the metal wall, dashing on the white zone which was only 1 foot wide.\n\nHan Sen was very fast, unlike the previous soldiers who were trying to control their speed so that they had more time to observe and decide how to go ahead. Han Sen did the opposite thing. He was fast from the beginning, going forward on the randomly laid metal walls.\n\nA newbie is just a newbie. Going like this, he would fall in seconds. Many people were thinking in their head.\n\nWatching Han Sen going as fast as this, Wang Hou could not help but feel surprised, wondering if Han Sen was a true idiot or trying to fall as fast as possible.\n\nEven Chen Shoushan frowned slightly. If this was all he could do, it would be a waste of Ji Yanran\u2019s energy. Chen Shoushan was quite disappointed."
