You want to challenge me?\u201d Xie Yuxin was legitimately surprised.\n\nWAA was the top warframe league across the entire Alliance. Those who were eligible to compete in such a league were the best of the best; true professionals in every sense of the word. They might not have received much fame, but that was no slight to their talents.\n\nHan Sen put Bao\u2019er on his shoulder and said, \u201cIf Bao\u2019er made this deal, I\u2019d be foolish to turn this down. I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint her.\u201d\n\nA young man then stepped forward to ask Han Sen, \u201cYou know what the WAA is, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shook his head to tell them he didn\u2019t. Aside from those who were invested in the warframe community, it was not likely people would know about each league there was.\n\nHan Sen spent most of his time in the sanctuaries, so he genuinely had no clue as to what the WAA was.\n\nXie Yuxin, and all who followed her, were given a shock.\n\n\u201cMight I ask, where did you learn to operate a warframe?\u201d Xie Yuxin nervously asked.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s see\u2026 I think it was during my time in the military school,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nEveryone was becoming breathless with their repeated gasps. The crowd that had come now looked amongst themselves, all with looks of confusion on their faces. What Han Sen had just told them was basically the equivalent of learning a sport through what you\u2019ve seen on the telly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the holographic room. There\u2019s no need to make use of real warframes. We like Bao\u2019er,\u201d Xie Yuxin said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Han Sen then turned around and asked Ji Yanran and Zero, \u201cWould you two like to wait here, or would you like to come and watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to go!\u201d Ji Yanran exclaimed, pulling Zero roughly by her arms.\n\nEveryone promptly went to the holographic room. The opponents took their positions.\n\nXie Yuxin winked to Bao\u2019er and said, \u201cIf your father loses, you are ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Daddy-o won\u2019t lose,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, emotionlessly. Her flat tone was almost creepy.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, I would like you to remember this word: professional. That\u2019s what I am.\u201d After that, Xie Yuxin entered the holographic machine.\n\nHan Sen then passed Bao\u2019er over to Ji Yanran. After that, he entered the holographic machine. After the two entered the battleground, the lobby displayed a screen for all spectators to watch.\n\n\u201cGo Dad!\u201d Bao\u2019er shouted, in support of Han Sen.\n\nBao\u2019er then punched the palm of her other hand, proclaiming, \u201cWhen I win, all that candy will be mine!\u201d\n\nEveryone in the lobby had gathered around to watch. Then, another woman appeared there, wearing sunglasses.\n\n\u201cShaoqing, why are you here?\u201d The woman looked shocked at seeing everyone there.\n\nA young man turned around then and asked, \u201cWhy have you come here, sister?\u201d\n\nHearing Yu Shaoqing call her sister, everyone turned to look at her.\n\n\u201cIs that your big sister? Is that our idol?\u201d another young man asked.\n\n\u201cHow many sisters do I have?\u201d Yu Shaoqing said, with a long roll of his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Yu Qianxun?\u201d Everyone gasped in shock.\n\nThe woman took off her sunglasses, revealing herself to be the ace operator that she was.\n\nYu Shaoqing was a professional, but even he could not compete with the talents of Yu Qianxun.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Yu Qianxun asked.\n\nYu Shaoqing explained what was going on, which prompted Yu Qianxun to then ask, \u201cWhy are you trying to hustle a random person?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little girl is too cute. We want to spend some time with her! We told her father we\u2019re from the WAA, and yet he still agreed,\u201d Yu Shaoqing pleaded in defense.\n\nYu Qianxun did not say anything more, as the match was about to begin.\n\nShe was shocked, seeing Han Sen\u2019s warframe.\n\n\u201cSKTS? Who uses an old model like that in this day and age? I\u2019m surprised that thing is not a rusted mound of bolts and scrap.\u201d Yu Shaoqing wanted to laugh, but he noticed something, and then went on to ask, \u201cSister, didn\u2019t you advertise this model?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It has been many years since then,\u201d Yu Qianxun said.\n\nShe had done many adverts for super warframes in the past, but the SKTS was the only model she had not operated herself.\n\nShe sighed and then said, \u201cIt is a shame this guy did not take a career as a warframe operator. He\u2019d be a legend.\u201d\n\nYu Qianxun seemed to take great interest in the fight that was about to unfold, and so she watched the screen intently.\n\nXie Yuxin recognized Han Sen\u2019s warframe and identified it as the supremely outdated SKTS. This did not boost her confidence, though. She was humble enough to realize she had underestimated her opponent.\n\nBut she herself was using a Sky Warrior, a model that was, for all intents and purposes, better than the SKTS.\n\nThe SKTS did not have much in terms of weaponry and firepower, so even though its infrastructure was weaker and more fragile, it wasn\u2019t as if it made up for it with greater damage output.\n\nShe wanted to showcase her agility, so she pulled out her laser sword and ran forward.\n\nHan Sen had not operated a warframe for a while, so he chose to use the old SKTS. After all, it was the model he was most comfortable with and knowledgeable about. Han Sen moved around and got into the groove of its use again, despite acknowledging he was still quite rusty.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen had a high fitness. So, any bumps he took as he got comfy with the SKTS again were no big deal.\n\nHan Sen laughed, seeing his opponent come at him with a close-quarter combat weapon. It surprised even him that she did not seek to use ranged weaponry.\n\nIf she was a real soldier, she wouldn\u2019t behave that way. The warframes of the Alliance were mostly for show, so range was favored in almost every way. It was strange how she wished to showcase her talents and impress the audience through close-quarter combat."
