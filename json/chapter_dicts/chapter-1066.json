She had not teleported with the others as expected, and she had been left all alone.\n\nShe set out in search of Han Sen but had an unfortunate encounter with crystallizer robots.\n\nJi Yanran was weak, and only an evolver. For her, dealing with the crystallizer robots would have been nearly impossible. Therefore, all she could do was run.\n\nEventually, her pace slowed down as she became exhausted. It was at this moment that the robots were able to catch-up and surround her.\n\nSeeing the robots surround her, Ji Yanran\u2019s hope for survival was depleted.\n\nThe robots raised their hands, each preparing to fire their lasers at Ji Yanran to eliminate her.\n\nBut just as she closed her eyes in acceptance of the death she was now to suffer, something big and heavy appeared to crush the robots.\n\nThe hulking robots were all shattered in an array of sparks and electrical fires. It was a shocking twist of fate.\n\nBut any happiness she may have felt over her salvation soon vanished. Seeing the titan that now stood in front of her, it didn\u2019t take long for hope to take its leave once more.\n\nShe was unable to deal with the robots, so taking on a giant black beetle was sure to be even more difficult.\n\nPang! Pang!\n\nA few more robots took to the field. With their arms raised, they fired laser beams at the beetle.\n\nBut it was like water spraying the steel hull of a ship. Not a single mark or scrape was left on the shell of the beetle.\n\nBoom!\n\nA horrible light shot out of the beetle\u2019s eyes, cutting down the robots in less than a second.\n\nJi Yanran did not know why the crystallizer machine was attacking its own, but it did not matter. She had accepted the fact she was likely to die there, all alone.\n\nThen, when one leg of the giant beetle pierced the ground directly in front of her, she closed her eyes and thought to herself, \u201cThis is all my fault. I pray he can escape this place alive.\u201d\n\nJi Yanran closed her eyes, but the death she expected did not come. After a while, she opened her eyes again.\n\nJi Yanran believed she might have been dreaming for a second, as Han Sen was there, standing in front of her with a smile.\n\n\u201cAm I dreaming? Or have I died and gone to heaven? Did you not make it out, either?\u201d Ji Yanran lifted her fingers to brush his cheeks.\n\n\u201cNope. This is just my new aircraft. Want to go for a ride?\u201d Han Sen invited her inside with a cheeky grin.\n\n\u201cWait a minute; this is your\u2026?\u201d Ji Yanran stared at the giant beetle in utter disbelief.\n\nHan Sen picked her up and took her inside the control room with him.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe beetle shot up into the sky, faster than any aircraft they had ever been on.\n\nHan Sen flew around like a jet, blasting any crystallizer robots he came across along the way. As they went, Ji Yanran had to ask, \u201cWhat is this machine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found it in a ruin. I can only suspect it was a crystallizer warframe.\u201d Han Sen then went on to ask, \u201cIs that a purple crystal core?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Ji Yanran looked happy.\n\nHan Sen fired a light to a purple core down on the grasslands below. In an instant, it was sucked into the beetle.\n\n\u201cBaby, hold on tight. This is going to get a little wild,\u201d Han Sen warned her.\n\nThen, the beetle started flying even faster. It spun around and eliminated a few crystallizer guards that were ahead. He zipped left, right, and center, collecting a multitude of purple crystal cores.\n\nWhen he was done, Han Sen used his holographic map to survey the entire region and track the location of his teammates. Fortunately, none of the others were in any danger.\n\nBut they were each traveling at a very slow pace, not wishing to be hasty.\n\nIt was most likely due to the fact they had all been split up, and they were each exercising caution by moving slowly but cautiously.\n\nHan Sen paid little mind to this, though. He continued flying on his own, out in search of the purple crystal cores that were their objective.\n\nUnless the beetle attacked first, the guards would not respond to the aircraft. He blended in. So, with no threat, there\u2019d be nothing to slow him down.\n\nHe did not want his teammates to see him operate the machine, either. If they did, it\u2019d cause a lot of trouble for him, and the machine would end up being confiscated by the Alliance. Since this all had something to do with his hand, too, there\u2019d be nothing but trouble for Han Sen.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t mind Bai Yishan seeing it, but if the others did, the Alliance would most certainly take it away.\n\nAs far as the operation was concerned, the only thing Han Sen was unsure about was the purpose of the purple crystal cores. He had no clue what they could be used for.\n\nBefore he managed to obtain the black beetle, he\u2019d had no way of hiding some for his own examination. Attempting to swallow a core and smuggle it out that way would\u2019ve been impossible. He would\u2019ve been scanned.\n\nBut now that he had this beetle, he could collect as many as he wanted and smuggle them out by shrinking down the beetle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not greedy, but without this black beetle, I doubt the others will be able to obtain many themselves. It\u2019s only fair that I get to keep a few for myself, if it means the bigwigs who ordered this operation also receive far more than they expected to.\u201d Han Sen gave himself an excuse that worked.\n\n\u201cOnce I\u2019ve got all the purple cores, I think I\u2019ll kill all those shura,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\n\u201cWe are cooperating, but we are still enemies. This truce is a farce, and we all know it.\u201d Han Sen believed the more he could kill for the Alliance now, the fewer enemies they would have to deal with in the future.\n\nHan Sen would be able to pin their deaths on the crystallizers with ease, and killing them would be swift and painless with the beetle, anyway."
