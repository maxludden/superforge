    "text": "The exchange was supposed to be a stage for Moon Garden and its members, but Han Sen\u2019s Buddha writing and Gu Qingcheng\u2019s display of sword skills made the aforementioned members\u2014and the Buddhas\u2014look rather lame. Han Sen was on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue now.\n\nPeople thought Gu Qingcheng was a family member of Han Sen. Believing that, it meant one member of his family could beat Speechless Buddha. Han Sen also had Teeth Knife and created a mind simply by watching a Buddha\u2019s performance. It was all so unbelievable. The whole of Narrow Moon was fascinated.\n\nThe real elites did not believe Han Sen\u2019s words, though. They did not think he could learn as simply as he had claimed. Yisha was one of these non-believers, too. As soon as the exchange ended, Han Sen was summoned to the palace. \u201cWhere did you learn Touching Flower Finger?\u201d Yisha asked.\n\n\u201cI found this book, and I learned Touching Flower Finger from it.\u201d Han Sen gave Unlimited Sutra over to Yisha.\n\nHan Sen had prepared an explanation when he borrowed Ancient Devil\u2019s mind. But Ancient Devil\u2019s mind had been too strong, and so Yisha found it difficult to believe him.\n\n\u201cThis must be the original version of Unlimited Sutra. It is a secret skill of the Buddha. Where did you get it from?\u201d Yisha looked at the Unlimited Sutra text and seemed very surprised.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I saved an injured man. He was an old fellow. I brought him home, and I healed him. He gave this to me before he left.\u201d Han Sen had prepared all the stuff he was going to tell her.\n\n\u201cWhat did he look like? Can you confirm he was one of the Buddha?\u201d Yisha asked.\n\n\u201cI was very young, so I didn\u2019t know what a Buddha was back then. Even so, I don\u2019t think he was. I\u2019m fairly sure that the old man had hair.\u201d Han Sen described Ancient Devil\u2019s face to her, but with a few added years.\n\nYisha heard what he had to say, but she did not immediately respond. After a while of thought, she said, \u201cYou used this Unlimited Sutra to practice Touching Flower Finger to such a high degree of skill?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Han Sen forced himself to say. He was going to pretend he was a genius, so Yisha might be willing to part with more resources. But Ancient Devil had deliberately overcast his mind and made Han Sen look ridiculous. He didn\u2019t know if Yisha would believe him.\n\nYisha didn\u2019t believe him entirely, either. It was just the Unlimited Sutra, from what she could see. There didn\u2019t seem to be any extra guidance. Furthermore, Han Sen was just a commoner. No one should believe he could reach that level.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you are a genius,\u201d Yisha said, while looking right at Han Sen.\n\nShe could not completely trust what Han Sen said, but she was still happy about his performance. She didn\u2019t want to think about Han Sen possibly lying.\n\n\u201cThank you very much. I am a bit stupid, and others can learn many things. All I can learn is one thing at a time. I am afraid that is why I am so slow. I keep practicing, as I did with that, and that is how it happened,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nYisha looked at Unlimited Sutra, and then looked at Han. \u201cGood. In that case, keep being this stupid self of yours. If your stupid way can enable you to practice Touching Flower Finger to such a high level, I am sure you can practice Teeth Knife knifemind just fine. Is three months enough for that, do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Queen, Teeth Knife is the ultimate knife skill. It is not all that easy to generate a knifemind. I am afraid I will only disappoint you again.\u201d Han Sen pretended to look bitter. On the inside, however, he was delighted.\n\nThis was a two-birds-one-stone affair. With the title of a genius, he could use Teeth Knife knifemind without being required to hide his ability.\n\n\u201cJust this Unlimited Sutra can yield a mind like this? Right now, I will teach you. I will make you generate a knifemind. You don\u2019t need a deep mind for this, and you are already willing to say you cannot achieve this? Are you telling me that Teeth Knife is worse than Unlimited Sutra? Or are you simply saying that I am a poor teacher?\u201d Yisha looked coldly at Han Sen, as she spoke to him.\n\n\u201cThat is not what I meant! I will do what I can. I will not disappoint you.\u201d Han Sen quickly swore to God.\n\n\u201cGood. This is the good student I know.\u201d Yisha nodded.\n\nYisha did not actually believe what Han Sen was telling her, but she did not want to mistakenly place blame on him. So, she gave Han Sen a test. If Han Sen could generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months, it really would prove that he was a genius. And if that was true, she would go ahead and treat him even better.\n\nIf Han Sen failed this, then Han Sen would have a problem. And if so, he would need to be investigated. She could not blindly spend resources on him.\n\nHan Sen knew her thought process on this matter, though. And he was really happy about it. Generating a Teeth Knife knifemind was not even a test. It was way too easy.\n\n\u201cWhat is that family member of yours called? Where did you take her from?\u201d Yisha asked.\n\n\u201cMy Queen, her name is Gu Qingcheng. She is a member that comes from Planet Crooked Rock,\u201d Han Sen said quickly.\n\n\u201cNot bad. But you should keep an eye on her. People with a swordmind like that are usually out for something else,\u201d Yisha warned Han Sen.\n\nYisha knew many factions had sent spies to keep tabs on Han Sen. She thought Gu Qingcheng might be one of them.vThat was because Gu Qingcheng did not use all her powers against Speechless. Yisha wouldn\u2019t feel this way if she had.\n\nYisha had much greater strength than Gu Qingcheng, but Gu Qingcheng\u2019s swordmind might rival Yisha\u2019s.\n\nSpeechless only received her mind from an old monster. Gu Qingcheng was the real old monster.\n\n\u201cYes, I will ensure that I am careful.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\nAfter he left Yisha, Han Sen took a ship back to Planet Eclipse. He called Qiao, Lan Se, and Stay Up Late.\n\nHe invited them to Planet Eclipse, but Qiao and Lan Se thought things were fine with Seven Mirror. What\u2019s more, they had friends there now. And so, they made no plans to go to Planet Eclipse.\n\nStay Up Late wanted to know more about the geno universe, so he made plans to come. He was hoping to learn more news about the location of Littleflower and Nine-Life Cat, too. He did not want to stay in the same place for too long.\n\nAfter talking with Qiao, Han Sen returned his mind to Destiny\u2019s Tower. There, he spoke with Ancient Devil.\n\nAncient Devil was trapped in the tower, but he never assumed himself to be at a disadvantage. He spoke to Han Sen as if they were both equals.\n\nWhen Han Sen borrowed help from Ancient Devil, he told Ancient Devil that if co-operation went well, he\u2019d be willing to give him a chance.\n\nHelping Han Sen with his mind was just a part of his show of sincerity. He had performed too well, though. Han Sen couldn\u2019t be sure if he had done it on purpose, but Han Sen believed that he had.\n\n\u201cAncient Devil, you should co-operate properly. You shouldn\u2019t make stupid moves.\u201d Han Sen hadn\u2019t killed him because he knew too many secrets. And Han Sen wanted those secrets. All he could think about was finding a safe method for getting Ancient Devil to talk.\n\nHan Sen wanted those secrets too badly to get rid of Ancient Devil."
