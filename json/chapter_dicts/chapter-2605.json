    "text": "The meeting ended quickly. The story of Han Sen making a butterfly in the palms of his hands spread across all of Sky Palace. The Sky Palace students were delighted by the result.\n\nWhen they were alone, Bixi and Exquisite discussed what had happened. Bixi frowned and asked her, \u201cYou want to make Han Sen your silkworm?\u201d\n\nExquisite nodded and said, \u201cIf Lone Bamboo isn\u2019t willing to join the Very High, there is no point in forcing him to. I should use this opportunity to take Han Sen with me.\u201d\n\nBixi frowned even more. \u201cHave you thought this through? Han Sen looks very talented, but I don\u2019t think things are as simple as they seem with him. Perhaps he has practiced a special and unique geno art that allowed him to access and activate the God Spirit Touch\u2019s gene potential and make the God Spirit Touch become deified. That might have been why he was able to make the butterfly and create the illusion of having an eleven armor talent. Perhaps that isn\u2019t his true talent. You should know that crystallizers can\u2019t have a gene talent that high.\u201d\n\nExquisite sighed and said, \u201cIt is impossible. Eleven armor talents exist only in legends. Han Sen isn\u2019t bad, but I know he can\u2019t reach those mythical heights. But still, there must be a reason for what transpired. In addition, I have seen for myself that Han Sen is talented. And the geno art he uses can make other creatures evolve. And that is impressive on its own. This power he has is very rare. Even if his talent was ordinary, I would be willing to make him my silkworm so I could study that geno art of his. Plus, there is the chance he still has excellent talent.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing this, Bixi didn\u2019t deny the possibility. He said, \u201cYou are right. That power is so mysterious. Even our race doesn\u2019t have a geno art that could accomplish what Han Sen had done. That miraculous geno art is more than enough reason for you to take him on as your silkworm.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince you agree, can you please bring this subject up for discussion when we talk to Sky Palace tomorrow?\u201d Exquisite said.\n\nBixi nodded and said, \u201cBut before that, I need to go and test Han Sen. I need to see his true power.\u201d\n\nExquisite didn\u2019t object to this. There were many stories surrounding Han Sen, but she had never witnessed his abilities directly. She wouldn\u2019t place her faith in Han Sen\u2019s skills until she saw them first hand.\n\n\u201cHan Sen\u2019s wounds have yet to heal. I don\u2019t think we should fight him. But if we don\u2019t, how else should we test him?\u201d Exquisite asked.\n\n\u201cI have a way,\u201d Bixi said without explaining.\n\nHan Sen returned to his little jade island to heal. Fortunately, the leader of Sky Palace forbade others from entering the island and disturbing him. If people had been allowed to go and see him after what had just happened, he wouldn\u2019t have had a single second of reprieve.\n\nHan Sen had used his hands to produce a butterfly. That boosted Han Sen\u2019s reputation to a whole new level. Although Han Sen wasn\u2019t related to the people of Sky Palace by blood, his reputation was one of the best of that whole generation. He was on par with Yu Shanxin and Lone Bamboo.\n\nWhen the story of Han Sen using his hands to produce a butterfly reached Narrow Moon, many of the Rebate stunned at the news.\n\nSome of the Rebate hadn\u2019t liked it when Yisha decided to move Narrow Moon, but now they were starting to change their minds. They didn\u2019t hate the concept of moving anymore.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is Knife Queen\u2019s only student. Knife Queen offended the Extreme King on his behalf and moved Narrow Moon next to Sky Palace. So, Han Sen is with us. In the future, Han Sen will work for the Rebate. He will bless us. Perhaps we will have a chance to rise as well.\u201d Many of the Rebate were thinking along these lines.\n\nAfter all this happened, a lot of the pressure that the Rebate had been putting on Yisha abruptly fell away. The Kings that had always been against her had changed their minds. They kept mentioning the idea of bringing Han Sen over to bless them.\n\nYisha pretended not to hear those constant whisperings. She had seen Han Sen\u2019s blessing, and she knew it was something amazing. But Yisha didn\u2019t think that power could turn a dumpster fire into a deified.\n\nFrom what Yisha had seen, the people that were blessed by Han Sen were already quite close to becoming deified. For someone who already didn\u2019t have a chance of becoming deified, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference no matter how many blessings were bestowed.\n\nYisha knew that Han Sen wouldn\u2019t turn her down if she made a request, so she didn\u2019t ask just yet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like she was too full of pride to ask for the help of her student; there was simply no one in the Rebate that was suitable for the blessing.\n\nThe Rebate were considered a higher race, but their ranking was still low on that generous leaderboard. They had depended on the support of the Jade Toad and the Extreme King to become a higher race. Now that she was deified, she was the biggest supporter the Rebate had.\n\nShe was the only being of her level within the Rebate. The only Rebate close to being deified was Moon Wheel King, but he was old, and his lifespan had almost reached its end. It was unknown if he could become a deified after receiving a blessing. Even if he did, though, he wouldn\u2019t live long enough to do much for the Rebate.\n\nYisha couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that the Rebate had no one special like Lando or Barr. It was giving her a headache. As Yisha continued working, Bao\u2019er ran into the hall and leaped into her chest.\n\n\u201cBig Sister Queen!\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, why are you here?\u201d Yisha stroked Bao\u2019er\u2019s head and smiled.\n\nBao\u2019er used to live in the palace with Yisha. Yisha had liked her a lot and spoiled her quite a bit.\n\n\u201cDaddy brought me here,\u201d Bao\u2019er said with a smile.Yisha looked ahead and saw Han Sen being led forward by a Rebate guard. He was brought into the hall. She told the guard straight away, \u201cLet him in!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Queen,\u201d Han Sen said with a bow.\n\nYisha looked at Han Sen and observed how weak and frail his body had become. She said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you resting on the little jade island? You shouldn\u2019t be running around in this shape.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew Yisha was referring to the fact that he had just blessed the God Spirit Touch. He smiled and said, \u201cI was just going to listen to the Very High explain geno arts. I was pushed to the stage to do something against my will.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen went on to say, \u201cMy body hasn\u2019t recovered yet. It will probably take a whole year. Maybe my Queen can pick two or three people from the Rebate for me, and I will find the time to bless them. It will help you all. If they aren\u2019t talented enough to become deified, they can still be made considerably stronger.\u201d\n\nYisha was very pleased. Han Sen had mentioned this without being asked to. She believed she had made the right decision.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame there are no psychics here that can calculate the location of people. It is impossible to find Dollar now,\u201d Yisha thought to herself. She still hadn\u2019t let her grudge against Dollar go.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t really looking for Dollar because of her grudge, though. Yisha wanted to get the Rebate alpha\u2019s scabbard back."
