    "text": "Shale glanced toward Mo Fang, and Mo Fang lifted his lips while looking back at Shale. Neither said a word, but they each knew what the other was thinking.\n\n\u201cButterfly, are you with us, or are you with Shale?\u201d Mo Fang asked, looking at the Fox woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a weak woman. I can\u2019t help anyone,\u201d Butterfly said while falling back. She didn\u2019t want to help either side.\n\nMo Fang knew the woman was more than she seemed. She had deliberately leaked the news that Shale was no longer deified. She obviously wanted to sit back and receive whatever benefits stumbled into her lap.\n\nBut Mo Fang didn\u2019t mind. No matter how tricky she might have been, she simply wasn\u2019t strong enough to affect his chances of securing first place, he believed. For right now, only Shale was standing in his way.\n\n\u201cShale, are you really going to protect Han Sen?\u201d Shale nodded at the others who had come with him. The three of them spread out, surrounding Shale.\n\n\u201cWhether I agreed to protect him or not, I would have been forced to face you eventually,\u201d Shale said while standing up. His body was three meters tall. He radiated power, and he was intimidating even when he wasn\u2019t trying to be. He looked like a golden-maned lion.\n\nMo Fang smiled and said, \u201cIf you quit now, we don\u2019t have to waste time fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust fight.\u201d Shale looked so calm. He had all the peaceful solidity of a mountain.\n\n\u201cThen you will have to be careful,\u201d Mo Fang said. He pointed a finger, and the Evilbreaker powers of the Dragon spread over his fist.\n\nThe Dragon were widely-considered the bravest race, and Evilbreaker powers were powers that could concentrate might. They could make the smallest attacks into the strongest attacks. It was similar to Han Sen\u2019s Heart Connection.\n\nBut Heart Connection released all of someone\u2019s power at once. Evilbreaker powers only concentrated the power you wanted to use at the moment.\n\nHan Sen once spent time investigating the Evilbreaker powers of the Dragon, and he came to the conclusion that it was a very scary geno art.\n\nRight now, Mo Fang was using the ability to summon strength. The power he gathered was stronger than that of a Dragon deified. It was like his finger could form a black hole in space.\n\nShale didn\u2019t dodge or run. His giant body stepped forward as he swung his fist. He moved so quickly that his blonde hair waved in the wind, his body surging forward like that of an enraged lion.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe finger and the fist collided with each other, and the ensuing explosion tore apart the nearby terrain. Shale didn\u2019t move at all, whereas Mo Fang fell back ten meters.\n\nMo Fang smiled. Then, he laughed and said, \u201cYou truly are a born-deified. Even if you are weaker now, your fitness is still incredibly rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was just physical power. It was nothing compared to the secret geno arts of the Very High,\u201d Shale said humbly.\n\n\u201cIn regards to personal power, I\u2019m not your equal. But I want to reach first place. Therefore, I must apologize,\u201d Mo Fang said. The Extreme King fighters and the Aichi then made their move.\n\nNow, Shale was in the same type of trouble that Han Sen had previously been in. But Shale\u2019s situation was even direr.\n\nThe primary difference was the swapping of Mo Fang for the mantis-man. There was a big difference between the capabilities of those two. Mo Fang\u2019s strength was far greater than the mantis-man\u2019s had been.\n\nIt might have been an illusion, but with Mo Fang\u2019s participation, the cooperation of the others seemed to be far better than it had been the last time. It appeared unbreakable.\n\n\u201cMo Fang is skilled with heart techniques. With his ability to command, he can control the other silkworms as if he was twiddling his fingers. He can allow four people to conduct group combat at their max potential. Shale doesn\u2019t have the power to suppress them, so it is clear that he is in danger,\u201d Exquisite said while looking at Shale down on the battlefield.\n\nWhile Exquisite spoke, Shale endured a few hits.\n\nShale was born to a small race that didn\u2019t have any good geno arts. Aside from his talent and level, his heritage was worse than Han Sen\u2019s. The few good geno arts he had were the ones he had learned during his stay in Outer Sky.\n\nIt was impossible for Shale to defeat the four people surrounding him with his skillset.\n\nShale might not have been less skilled than Han Sen, but he lacked Han Sen\u2019s range and diversity.\n\nHe had been trapped by the areas unleashed by the Aichi warrior and the two Extreme King fighters, and his power couldn\u2019t reach Mo Fang. He was like a beast trapped inside a cage. No matter how much he struggled, he couldn\u2019t get out of the cage. And the people outside the cage were hurting him.\n\nMo Fang moved his fingers as if they were ten separate blades. Scary godlights were shining everywhere, and countless marks were being drawn across Shale\u2019s body.\n\nMo Fang had a title. He was known as the Eight Hole Emperor.\n\nSomeone who was known to be particularly empathic or sensitive was often called an \u201cEight Face Exquisite\u201d or a \u201cSeven Hole Exquisite Heart.\u201d Mo Fang\u2019s title was created as a combination of those two terms because he could use his empathy to affect others. He became known as the Eight Hole Emperor.\n\nHe could do far more than just control three half-deifieds; he could easily exert influence over armies comprised of tens of thousands of troops. Such a feat would be easy for Mo Fang.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful body. You seem stronger than the average Very High. Ten armor talents are very rare. No wonder you are so famous.\u201d Mo Fang had used his initial attack against Shale several times, but he could only shred the man\u2019s skin to leave behind minor wounds. He felt compelled to compliment his foe.\n\nLiyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng\u2019s hearts almost hopped out of their chests. Right now, they weren\u2019t even worried about Han Sen beating Shale; it looked like Shale might not even last long enough to fight him.\n\n\u201cD*mn it!\u201d Li Xue Cheng\u2019s face darkened in rage. He thought about what might happen if Shale lost the silkworm bout. He felt dizzy, and his body kept shivering. The Very High that were banking on Han Sen winning were very happy, by comparison.\n\n\u201cThat kid Mo Fang isn\u2019t bad. Although his power is weak, I can\u2019t think of a single Very High of the young generation that is a better commander.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood job. Get rid of Shale quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! Mo Fang will kill him. And then, he will kill Han Sen. I like this story.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nShale was incurring more and more wounds. If a half-deified was any weaker than Shale, they would have already lost this fight. But looking into his eyes, it was obvious that Shale wasn\u2019t scared. He wasn\u2019t going to retreat.\n\nHis eyes looked like the eyes of a lion. He was excited, as excited as a bloodthirsty beast. It was like some sort of stimulant was pumping through his veins instead of blood.\n\nMo Fang frowned. He realized how difficult it was to harm Shale. He could use an attack against Shale once, and after that, the same attack would no longer damage him. Mo Fang had to keep changing his fighting stance as he used one technique after another.\n\nTo an outsider, it might look like Shale was being suppressed. Someone would have needed to look very close to realize how much Mo Fang was struggling.\n\nEven though the Very High had thousands of geno arts, with most coming from other races, Mo Fang hadn\u2019t practiced them all. If this continued for too long, he would have to start repeating his skills.\n\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d Disappointment welled up within Shale\u2019s eyes."
