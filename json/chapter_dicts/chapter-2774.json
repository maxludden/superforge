    "text": "Aside from that, Han Sen felt no changes occurring within his body. His Dongxuan Armor\u2019s power wasn\u2019t locked or limited.\n\nWhen the fire went out, the Dongxuan Armor had turned into a white, semi-transparent crystal. It looked like a dream, like something that couldn\u2019t possibly exist in the real world.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. He generated his Dongxuan Sutra power and realized his dongxuan power was activated. With it, he could harness white phoenix fires.\n\n\u201cNow that you have the phoenix flame\u2019s power, you can make effective use of the phoenix feather,\u201d the phoenix said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t overjoyed by this, though. His Dongxuan Sutra was already fine, but now his armor was linked to the god phoenix flame. If he used his Dongxuan Armor, it would trigger the phoenix fire.\n\nThat seemed like a good thing at first thought. The phoenix fires was a high-class power that most people would admire, but it simply wasn\u2019t Han Sen\u2019s forte. If the phoenix had placed its phoenix flames on the Dongxuan Armor, it wasn\u2019t likely that the fire\u2019s only function was allowing Han Sen to use the phoenix feather.\n\nAlthough Han Sen immediately thought this, he didn\u2019t say anything to the phoenix.\n\n\u201cGo. If you can bring back that baby phoenix, I will allow your people to live here, protected by our race,\u201d the phoenix promised.\n\n\u201cThis place is a smoldering wasteland. Who would want to live here?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. The conditions that the phoenix had wrought on the land around it didn\u2019t seem to be all that inviting.\n\nIt seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking, though. The phoenix continued, explaining, \u201cThis is where the phoenix race started. Now, only I am left. I don\u2019t really need much space anymore. If you can bring that baby phoenix back to me, I will allow you to make use of a million miles. You may cultivate it however you see fit, and if an enemy shows up, I promise to help you chase them away.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the phoenix looked across the burned world and said, \u201cAfter bad things reach their lowest point, good things then tend to rise. This is an incinerated land, but it isn\u2019t a dead realm. It can yield benefits beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of benefits?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but ask.\n\n\u201cOnly the dying can live. Death comes first so that newborns can grow. This xenogeneic space has extremely potent powers of life. Any creature, whether it is a plant, animal, or xenogeneic, will grow better here than they would in the outside world,\u201d the phoenix said.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I feel anything special about this place?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe what the phoenix said because he couldn\u2019t feel anything strange going on inside him. He couldn\u2019t detect the lifeforce in this xenogeneic space doing anything that the phoenix had just described.\n\n\u201cDo you have any seeds?\u201d the phoenix asked, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have seeds, but I do have a small plant.\u201d Han Sen brought out a cactus from Destiny\u2019s Tower in a glass pot.\n\n\u201cPut it in the soil,\u201d the phoenix said.\n\nHan Sen was confused. He took the cactus out of the pot and planted it in the soil.\n\nThen, a miracle happened. The cactus had been the size of a fist, but as Han Sen watched, it began to grow. A second later, it was the size of a football. And it was still growing.\n\n\u201cAny creature that can absorb this extreme living power can grow quickly, just like this plant you have planted. Beneath the extreme living power, a being can develop very fast and reach the max of what one\u2019s genes can support. There is only one extreme living land in the universe, and it is here. It belongs to the phoenixes. There is no other in the universe,\u201d the phoenix said with a cocky look.\n\nAs the phoenix spoke, the cactus that Han Sen had planted reached the size of a barrel. And still, it continued to grow. It shocked Han Sen a great deal. He couldn\u2019t even explain how staggering this was.\n\n\u201cDoes all the land in this place have power similar to what I\u2019m seeing here?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at the phoenix in wonder. He knew what that meant. If any creature could grow that rapidly in a certain location, it almost suggested that the area was a glitch. It went against the laws of nature.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the phoenix said with a nod.\n\nHan Sen was speechless. He was so happy to hear that he might be allowed to enter a xenogeneic space as profound as that. It would be a great boon for the development of humans.\n\nPlus, he would have a true god phoenix to protect the race. Humans in this universe would be as safe as Tarzan. Aside from the three higher races, no one could even attempt to assault the territory protected by the phoenix. Now, Han Sen was seriously considering handing over the little red bird.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Phoenix. I\u2019m going to try my best to locate the baby phoenix. I will bring it to you.\u201d Han Sen licked his lips as he spoke.\n\nThe phoenix was happy with Han Sen\u2019s performance thus far, and it didn\u2019t keep him. It told Han Sen that when he located the baby phoenix, he simply needed to return and ring the black-steel bell. Then, the phoenix would come to pick up Han Sen and the baby phoenix.\n\nHan Sen collected his phoenix feather and left that nirvana. He was so tempted by the phoenix\u2019s offer that he thought to himself, \u201cIt is a shame that the little red bird is a mix. If the phoenix isn\u2019t fond of it, this might turn bad. I shouldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen decided that he wouldn\u2019t bring the little red bird there, after all. After departing from the xenogeneic space, he traveled a great many leagues away.\n\n\u201cThe Very High don\u2019t know that I have escaped, but I\u2019m not going back to Sky Palace. In case the Very High have already found out, I should delay the news for as long as I can,\u201d Han Sen thought for a while. He was now planning to go back to the God Area to hunt deified xenogeneics for a while. That way, he could max out his deified gene tallies.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t dare stay near the nirvana. He contacted Xie Qing King and made plans to live with him for a while.\n\nXie Qing King immediately agreed to Han Sen\u2019s request. He gave out orders to send ships to collect Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pick me up. I just need to know if it is safe where you are. I\u2019m in trouble, and my identity can\u2019t be exposed,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nXie Qing King was chewing on a big cigar. With a pleased look, he said, \u201cA while ago, I bought a system that was part of the Sky Music Area. There are two planets with life, and the views aren\u2019t bad. I bought them to use as a vacation home. You should consider living there. The Sky Music Area is part of the Thousand Treasures. They are in charge of defense and security. Unless there is a universal war, I doubt any petty thieves would risk trying to break in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly crap. Do you earn that much money from writing comics?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes were wide open. Xie Qing King had bought an entire system to use as a vacation spot. It was too ridiculous to believe.\n\n\u201cCall me Teacher Xie. I am the most famous author with the best-selling books ever. The books have millions of fans across millions of races across the entire universe\u2026\u201d Xie Qing King said lazily, waving his cigar.\n\n\u201cTeacher Xie, does your comic studio need any extra hands?\u201d Han Sen was practically drooling. It sounded like easy money.\n\n\u201cYes, but we don\u2019t need people like you who don\u2019t have active imaginations. There\u2019s also the fact that you\u2019re very stingy.\u201d Xie Qing King obviously wasn\u2019t mincing his words when it came to insulting Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was rendered speechless. His personality was certainly rooted in reality, but he didn\u2019t lack imagination.\n\nStill, Han Sen had to admit that he had no artistic capabilities. Shaking his head, he struck an agreement with Xie Qing King and went to the man\u2019s vacation planet."
