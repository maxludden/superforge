If Han Jinzhi had been an ordinary man, then he would have already died and left the world. In that case, God wouldn\u2019t be able to find out where he was. At most, God would track him back to a gravesite.\n\nIf Han Sen\u2019s great-granddad was actually the legendary figure he\u2019d been told about, then Han Jinzhi had already escaped the powers of a God once. He must have been really powerful himself. This man who called himself God should have had a hard time finding someone like that.\n\nSomewhere in the universe, on a planet, in a certain street, a fortune-teller was sitting on the road. He was eating noodles, making loud slurping noises as he sucked them down.\n\nSuddenly, the fortune-teller\u2019s face changed. He accidentally dropped the noodles onto the ground as he shouted, \u201cWho is tricking me!\u201d\n\nThe fortune-teller\u2019s fingers twitched for a second. When he spoke again, his voice sounded furious. \u201cThat traitorous b*stard tricked me!\u201d\n\nWhile he was talking, the fortune-teller quickly pulled something out of his bag. He bit his middle finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the item. He mumbled, \u201cWhat a shame. Getting this treasure took so much work. When I go back, I\u2019m going to teach that little b*stard a lesson.\u201d\n\nA Fox was walking down the road, and she saw the fortune-teller holding an article of underwear decorated with flowers. He looked as if he was in pain. She stared at him, but the fortune-teller didn\u2019t even seem to notice. His face remained twisted in discomfort.\n\nIn Destiny\u2019s Tower, the man looked at Han Sen. The images reflected in his eyes kept changing, but all of them gleamed brightly.\n\nHan Sen had made a wish. When the wish was complete, the man could use his power on Han Sen. Tracing Han Sen\u2019s bloodline would be very easy, as it was just a basic power. It didn\u2019t even require any special tricks.\n\nAs the spell ran, the man considered different ways he could maximize his earnings from someone making such a wish.\n\nWhile he was in thought, the image in the man\u2019s eyes kept changing. The gleam of power in those eyes was constant, but the images within them began to whirl faster and faster.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d the man suddenly screamed. He covered his godly-looking eyes.\n\nHan Sen frowned and looked at the man. He didn\u2019t know what had happened. While he was wondering, he suddenly heard a pang! That man\u2019s eyes exploded, leaving behind two black holes.\n\nFrom the empty air of the room around them, a god-like voice laughed darkly. \u201cHow dare you spy on me! This time, I\u2019m only taking away your eyes. Next time, I will destroy your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 impossible! How could you be his heir?! That is impossible!\u201d screamed the man whose eyes had been incinerated.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s heir?\u201d Han Sen asked the man.\n\nNow he could see the wounds clearly. The holes in the man\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t flesh; they were rimmed with a jade-like substance. His eyes were completely destroyed, and there wasn\u2019t a single drop of blood.\n\nThe eyeless man looked creepy. The empty pits stared at Han Sen as the man gnashed his teeth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are his heir or not. You made a wish, and so, you must pay the price! Plus, there is no way you are his heir\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me where he is,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHe is where he should be,\u201d the man said sternly.\n\n\u201cThis is wrong. You have broken the rules!\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cThe rules are simple. I have done what you asked, and so, you must pay up.\u201d The man looked quite angry.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t pay up?\u201d Han Sen asked, glaring at the man.\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t up to you,\u201d the man laughed in a grating voice. A light began to shine around his body, like the aura of some ancient sky god.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face suddenly changed. He noticed his lifespan had been drastically reduced.\n\nNormal creatures in the geno universe couldn\u2019t detect their own lifespan, but Han Sen had come from the sanctuaries. He could see his own lifespan.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s maximum lifespan was reducing, year by year. It was transforming into a barely-visible light and drifting toward the man.\n\n\u201cIf this place wasn\u2019t Destiny\u2019s Tower, you would be giving me more than just years from your lifespan for destroying my eyes!\u201d the man seethed.\n\n\u201cThat was unlucky. I made a wish and received nothing. And on top of that, my lifespan is being stolen. These so-called gods are quite fickle.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was furious, and he had to act. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to lose any more years. He had already lost a dozen years, and the man was still sapping away even more. Han Sen didn\u2019t know how much lifespan the man planned on taking in payment for this wish.\n\nBut now Han Sen understood why the Extreme King didn\u2019t complain about the consequences of their wishes. A part of their lifespan was probably taken away, but unlike Han Sen, they had no way of knowing what was happening. Even if they did notice that something was different, they wouldn\u2019t know how much of their lifespan had been stolen.\n\nAs his lifespan drained away, Han Sen felt something powerful activate inside his Sea of Soul. That black crystal armor hanging in his Sea of Soul suddenly moved.\n\nWithout Han Sen\u2019s summoning, the black crystal armor appeared and floated in front of Han Sen. That black set of armor looked as if it could absorb all light. It made those who looked at it feel as if they were in the deepest recesses of hell.\n\nHan Sen froze as he looked upon the black crystal armor. The moment the armor floated in front of him, his lifespan had stopped decreasing. His connection with the man had been severed as decisively as if it had been snipped with a pair of scissors. Han Sen stopped losing years.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? I\u2019ve only taken a dozen years, but it should have been 153 years\u2026 Why is this happening?\u201d The man didn\u2019t seem to notice the presence of the black crystal armor. He looked very confused. He turned his eyeless sockets back to Han Sen.\n\nThe empty pits that were once eyes stared at Han Sen. He obviously wasn\u2019t adjusting well to his new handicap.\n\nThe black crystal armor, floating in front of Han Sen, lifted its gauntletted arm. In that moment, it looked more like a real person than an empty set of armor. It raised its hand and made a fist.\n\nThe black crystal armor walked up to the man, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice it. When the black crystal armor stepped in front of the man, the clenched fist suddenly launched in a savage punch.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe man\u2019s body exploded. He was like a rock being reduced to powder in an instant. Beneath the power of that fist, he was nothing more than dust on the wind.\n\nThe man who had called himself God was blown up in a single punch.\n\nAn iridescent power that Han Sen could barely see rose from the exploded body. Then it drifted into Han Sen.\n\n\u201cLifespan +1\u2026 Lifespan +1\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s lifespan began to shoot upward. In seconds, he had earned an additional one hundred years. He was gaining lifespan much faster than he had lost it, and the process was still accelerating.\n\n\u201cTwo hundred years\u2026 three hundred years\u2026 five hundred years\u2026\u201d Han Sen watched his own lifespan increase, and as he did, his heart began to pound. He felt as if it was going to jump out of his chest."
