    "text": "All the royal children made their ascent at a speed that was neither slow nor fast. The crown prince Bai Weijie was leading the way, but their formation began to change once they reached the halfway point.\n\nAt the middle point of the mountain\u2019s staircase, there was a stone tablet. Upon it was inscribed, \u201cTravel half the mountain, thinking like a sword.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t know what it meant, but once they passed by the tablet, everyone started to speed up. Prince Four and Princess Two went past the crown prince Bai Weijie. Other royal children started to pull away, as well. The group began to spread out into ragged clumps of hikers, so it wasn\u2019t as tidy as it had been before the halfway point.\n\nThe King\u2019s Kingdom nobles that had been watching half-heartedly now looked wide awake. They paid attention to the two deified royal children, of course, but many of them were just as focused on Han Sen.\n\nAfter all, Han Sen had sounded very cocky in the opening ceremony the day before. If he didn\u2019t perform well now, it would become an embarrassing joke.\n\n\u201cBrother Sixteen, let us see who can reach the top of the mountain faster.\u201d Bai Qing Xia moved his feet faster and ran up the mountain like a sharp sword.\n\nHan Sen agreed to the competition, and he walked a bit faster, as well. Heavy resistance pushed against him.\n\nHan Sen still didn\u2019t understand, though. Earlier, they had all been hiking easily up the mountain. Why were they now forcing themselves to exhaust so much energy to go faster? They hadn\u2019t reached the hardest section of the path, which meant they couldn\u2019t be performing at their best.\n\nRegardless of how ridiculous it might seem, since everyone else was speeding up, Han Sen couldn\u2019t allow himself to be left behind. He had to take this chance. Otherwise, the boasting he had done during the opening ceremony would be for nothing.\n\nHan Sen cast his water area power, trying to break the resistance coming against him and make it easier to move forward. But the further he went, the more resistance piled on. He had spent a lot of energy already, and he couldn\u2019t really accelerate beyond his current speed.\n\nIf this continued, he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with Prince Four and Princess Two up ahead. He might even be left behind by the other half-deified royal children.\n\nJudging from the powers they used, those half-deified royal children were much stronger than second-tier Kings. Han Sen couldn\u2019t keep up with them using raw strength alone.\n\nHan Sen thought for a moment and then released his King area. He let the waterfall-like resistance land atop him. When that power washed over him, the Kingese in his body flashed gold and surged through Han Sen\u2019s blood.\n\nUnder the buffs of the Kingese, Han Sen felt the resistance get lighter. Although it was still there, it was substantially decreased.\n\nIf that resistance had previously been like a large river, it was now like a small stream. It ran no higher than Han Sen\u2019s ankles, and it was only a trifling problem.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything, though. Calling on the power of the gold Kingese inside him, he rushed forward against the competition. All of a sudden, he was leaving Bai Qing Xia in the dust.\n\nThe princes and princesses ahead were working so hard, but they were suddenly distracted by a stampede of frantic footsteps coming up behind them. The sound was so startling that they looked over their shoulders for the source. There, they saw Han Sen glowing with gold light, rushing madly forward. He blew right past them. Comparing Han Sen to the rest of them was like comparing a sports car to a lawnmower.\n\nThe royal children in the back stared at that rapidly disappearing shadow in disbelief. They were frozen. They almost forgot that they themselves had to keep moving.\n\nNo one had seen anyone run up the Rot Bone path like that before. Even deified elites struggled against the resistance of that trail. No one should have been able to reach max speed and actually sprint up the mountain.\n\nBut Han Sen ran like he was uninhibited. His legs pounded like a wild horse breaking free from his reins.\n\n\u201cHere! Here! Prince Sixteen is going to explode.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! He\u2019s so strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that the protection of all those Kingese? It looks like they work against the powers of Rot Bone Mountain. The Rot Bone powers can\u2019t restrict him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that speed, if he can keep going\u2026 Maybe he really can overtake the two deifieds ahead and claim first place\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh. He only got lucky. That isn\u2019t his real power on display. Even if he manages to run all the way to the top, he will only be winning first place in this race. The exams have many more trials and tasks for them. He can\u2019t rely solely on luck. Plus, who knows if he can even keep up this speed. The section of the trail above the clouds is the most important part.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nEveryone could see Han Sen running forward. He skipped by many royal children, and they looked excited.\n\nWhen Han Sen caught up to Bai Ling Shuang, she looked shocked, as well.\n\nShe knew the Kingese would reflect the power of Rot Bone Mountain. Usually, people with the Kingese symbols Ao and Gu had an easier time. For some reason, less resistance held them back.\n\nBut even the symbols Ao and Gu shouldn\u2019t have been able to obliterate the mountain\u2019s restrictive power like Han Sen\u2019s Kingese symbols were. The symbols were only supposed to cause a minor reduction in the resistance.\n\n\u201cIt looks like more symbols than just Ao and Gu are useful in the hike up Rot Bone Mountain. Other Kingese symbols have also been activated, but I guess no one has had them before, so there was no way we could have known,\u201d Bai Ling Shuang thought to herself. She now had a bit more confidence that she could take advantage of Han Sen\u2019s power to reach Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s peak.\n\nThis might have been a favorable turn of events for Bai Ling Shuang, but as she watched Han Sen\u2019s sprinting shadow, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit jealous. \u201cWhy was he the one who received the protection of thousands of Kingese? If I had gotten the protection of a thousand Kingese, perhaps I would have ended up as our new ruler.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe passed him\u2026 He passed him, too\u2026 He\u2019s caught up with the crown prince\u2026\u201d The audience was excited.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was gleaming with a golden light. He sprinted so fast that he went right past the crown prince. He was quickly gaining on Prince Four and Princess Two.\n\nPrince Four and Princess Two felt the pressure coming from behind them. They turned around to have a look, and there, they saw Han Sen coming towards them. He was carried forward by a graceful golden light. They frowned and accelerated as much as they could.\n\nHan Sen wanted to close the distance between them, but running wasn\u2019t as easy as it had been previously. Although he didn\u2019t have as much resistance to compete with, the force pressing against him hadn\u2019t vanished entirely. He still had to suffer some resistance, and so he couldn\u2019t go at max speed.\n\nThe onlookers were frozen. Three royal children were running really fast towards the peak, and a big gap had appeared between them and the others.\n\n\u201cDeified elites are so strong.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t catch up with Prince Four and Princess Two. The three of them entered the final part of the trail, vanishing behind the cloud cover. No one would be able to watch them anymore.\n\n\u201cPrince Four passed into the clouded trail first, so the deified elites still have a strength advantage. The protection of a thousand Kingese wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Someone sighed.\n\n\u201cWho will be the winner?\u201d King Bai, his queen, and the teacher stared at Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s peak with fervent interest.\n\nBefore, there was no excitement in waiting for someone to reach the top. The deified children always won. But this time, Han Sen was there, and that made the event interesting again."
