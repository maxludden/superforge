    "text": "\u201cIt must be the Demon Fruit\u2026 The Demon Fruit is working! Is Shale going to become deified right in front of us?\u201d Li Xue Cheng merrily proclaimed.\n\nLiyu Zhen was thrilled as well. \u201cNow I understand. Shale knew that the silkworm fights were going to start, but he decided to eat the Demon Fruit anyway. He hoped to use the pressure of a challenging silkworm fight to accelerate his growth and activate the dormant Demon Fruit power that resided in his body. During his fight with Han Sen, the Demon Fruit inside him has slowly been refined. Now, it must have all been absorbed. It will make him deified in the middle of this very fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cShale is really leveling up to deified? There will be no more debating which of the two will emerge victorious now. It will be impossible for Han Sen to defeat a deified Shale.\u201d Li Xue Cheng had been quivering with fear earlier, but now his quaking was due to unbridled glee.\n\nThis silkworm fight had been a non-stop rollercoaster of emotions for the two men. Li Xue Cheng\u2019s emotions had gone up and down so much that he had thought his heart was going to leap out of his chest.\n\nThe fires around Shale\u2019s body turned black. Black symbols were appearing across him, as if they were being carved into his exposed skin. A frightening presence was emanating from the symbols. Shale\u2019s power began to generate substance chains.\n\n\u201cBack to deified once more?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He wasn\u2019t blind. He could see that Shale\u2019s power was changing.\n\nShale tipped his head back and roared to the sky, and the power of his substance chains exploded. His previously golden hair was suddenly dyed pitch black.\n\nShale used to look like a gold lion. Now his body had shrunk, but his muscles looked more solid and powerful than ever. It was like every cell in his body had filled up with an unimaginably grand power.\n\nThe new, black-haired Shale didn\u2019t look as wild. He looked mysterious and alien. The black symbols were visible all across his face, and black flames quivered across his body. He looked like some sort of demon lion from hell.\n\n\u201cHe has returned to deified.\u201d Li Keer\u2019s face looked sickened.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter how talented or strong Han Sen was; he couldn\u2019t defeat a deified Shale. After all, deifieds were completely different from all other ranks beneath them. They were as different as the sky and the ground.\n\n\u201cShale must have planned from the beginning to use this fight to become deified again. He wanted to use Han Sen as his whetstone,\u201d Exquisite said glumly, then sighed. She understood the truth behind it all now.\n\n\u201cThat was excellent planning on Shale\u2019s part,\u201d Li Keer said with a grunt. \u201cHe ate the Demon Fruit before the silkworm fight. If no one presented him with a serious challenge, he could secure first place. If he did find someone who could stand up to him, he could refine the Demon Fruit and return to being deified and still secure first place and all the spoils. He is a very smart man, I will confess.\u201d\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cBut again, it isn\u2019t that simple. A normal person would struggle to become deified again whether or not they refined the Demon Fruit. Shale was able to become deified because his talent was that exceptional. This may not have been his plan at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what his reasoning was, these are the results,\u201d Li Keer said in frustration.\n\nQiyu Elder and Open Sky Elder both looked very ill. And the Very High people who had placed big bets on Han Sen looked just as bad.\n\nThey thought they had seen a sound hope of victory, but it was all gone now. Since the moment Shale became deified, their hopes and dreams were squashed. Their hearts fell to the bottom of the blackest abyss, and they couldn\u2019t see the light of hope anymore.\n\n\u201cI apologize. I tried to control my power, but I was unable to suppress it. I have now returned to deified class.\u201d Shale ceased attacking. He felt guilty about what had happened.\n\nWhat he said made everyone watching want to cough up blood. Many creatures wanted nothing more than to become deified, and Shale had been doing his best not to. That was quite upsetting.\n\nIf anyone else had said this, they might have sounded cocky. But Shale was renowned for his honesty, and he certainly wasn\u2019t putting on an act. He had genuinely tried to suppress his power, but he ended up becoming deified anyway. He had wanted to finish this fight as a half-deified.\n\nBut fighting Han Sen had required too much from him. He had no choice but to use his full power to fight, and so he was unable to hold back the energy of the refined Demon Fruit. Once that dam of power broke loose, he had become deified.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize. Your level is a part of your power.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think it was shameful for someone to fight against an opponent of a lower level. If someone had a higher level, they must have earned it.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s fight won\u2019t count. I will wait until you become deified, and then we will fight again,\u201d Shale said, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis fight isn\u2019t finished yet,\u201d Han Sen responded, his face unchanged.\n\nShale shook his head. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t want to win while you are at a lower level, I still need this first place. So, I\u2019m sorry. We should abandon this battle for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize. Didn\u2019t I just say our fight hasn\u2019t ended yet? If you can win, then it was because you were better than me. But in order to decide that, we must first fight and see who the victor truly is.\u201d Han Sen gazed at Shale calmly. He didn\u2019t look very emotional.\n\nWhen Liyu Zhen heard Han Sen say this, he coldly laughed and said, \u201cThis Han Sen really doesn\u2019t know his place. Shale has given him plenty of opportunities to bow out gracefully, and he even offered to leave this place together. That meant he would give Han Sen second place. But still, the brat insists on fighting. If he gets kicked out right now, he definitely won\u2019t end up in second place, either.\u201d\n\nLi Keer, Exquisite, and all the other Very High thought Han Sen\u2019s response had been too cocky. He should have accepted second place instead of losing now.\n\nBut in contrast to their own thoughts, Li Keer and Exquisite didn\u2019t detect any fear within Han Sen. Instead, they felt an overwhelming sensation of calm and confidence in him.\n\nThere was no need to be angry. There was no need to hate. There was no need to blame fate or the people around him. This powerful, placid confidence was something only superior people could possess.\n\n\u201cBut now Han Sen is a ridiculously dire situation. Why is he still this confident?\u201d Exquisite and Li Keer thought that Han Sen had no reason to be so self-assured, but his confidence was so strong that it affected them anyway. They began to feel like they should trust in Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCome on. Keep going. I will fight you. Whether I win or lose, I will walk out of here alone,\u201d Han Sen said calmly as he looked at Shale.\n\n\u201cYes, this is how it should be.\u201d Shale\u2019s eyes flared with excitement. He looked at Han Sen as if he was looking at his favorite piece of art.\n\nPerhaps Han Sen\u2019s power wasn\u2019t as strong as Shale\u2019s, but Shale wouldn\u2019t underestimate him. The substance chains around him exploded madly. He was like some leonine power of darkness that had crawled up from the depths.\n\n\u201cBecause of the respect I have for you, I will fight with all my power.\u201d Shale\u2019s voice was like thunder as he swung his fist at Han Sen."
