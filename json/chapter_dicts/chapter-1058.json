She hastily turned it off, with her face drained of all color.\n\nShe had planned to allow everyone to watch a shura prince destroy a petty human to raise morale, but clearly, her plan had backfired.\n\nWith the stream turned off, the people who had tuned in to watch now wondered whether or not what they had seen was real.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t believe a shura prince could have been bullied so cruelly by a young human like that.\n\nZhou Ping and his people could hardly contain their excitement, though, as it had been a long time since they felt such pride in their human brethren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll beat you next time,\u201d Yu Tuoshan wheezed, as he was carried out of the arena by paramedics. He was looking poorly, drenched in green blood.\n\n\u201cPower is not everything. You should work on the finesse of your skills. Just so you know, you lost to Yin Yang Blast,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYin Yang Blast? I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d Yu Tuoshan coughed. He was determined to remember the name of that skill, in case the shura were ever able to learn it.\n\nWhen Bai Yishan heard Han Sen say this, he was happier than ever.\n\n\u201cTeacher Zhao, take care of Han Sen,\u201d Ji Hailan ordered.\n\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Zhao Yongo scoffed.\n\nJi Hailan was utterly delighted, following what they had just witnessed. He quickly brought Han Sen over, for personal introductions with the other members of the expedition.\n\nJi Hailan introduced Bai Yishan, who was the strongest of the team and a professor.\n\nBai Yishan said, \u201cThere is no need for an introduction with me. I\u2019m closer with Han Sen than any of you lot are.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at Han Sen and Bai Yishan, and Ji Hailan was prompted to ask, \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and explained, \u201cThe skill I used was devised by Professor Bai. He just never took me as a formal student.\u201d\n\nProfessor Bai had tricked Han Sen into learning Yin Yang Blast, but he still took his time with Han Sen seriously. He taught him many things, and although it wasn\u2019t an official teacher-student relationship, it felt like one.\n\nBai Yishan, with a wry smile, said, \u201cI can\u2019t accept you as a student. Whenever we meet, something bad tends to follow. Many of my Saint Hall licenses were taken by you, after all.\u201d\n\nJi Yanran was the official team leader, but Bai Yishan was the authoritative figure amongst them.\n\nJi Hailan was more than glad their relationship was this good.\n\nWhen the introductions were over, someone came over to ask about Yin Yang Blast.\n\nThey were shocked, learning Han Sen was able to defeat the shura prince by using it.\n\nIf Han Sen had created it, they wouldn\u2019t have asked him to learn it, out of respect.\n\nBut they had now learned that Professor Bai had invented it, and as such, they were keen to ask about it. They all believed it should have been on sale in the Saint Hall.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t want a hyper geno art that powerful, right? But Bai Yishan explained that it had been banned. Han Sen was just fortunate enough to learn the skill before it was forbidden.\n\nThis disappointed everyone. While it was good to learn more about Han Sen\u2019s technique in beating the shura prince, it was pointless if there was no chance of them ever being able to do the same.\n\nSomeone then started to wonder what it might take for the skill to get unbanned.\n\nBai Yishan had helped out Han Sen a good deal, so if there was anything Han Sen could do to return the favor, he would have jumped at the chance. And if there was indeed a way to get Yin Yang Blast unbanned, Han Sen would have relished the chance of making this happen.\n\nWith Bai Yishan there, though, there was no need for him to explain to the crowd why the skill was as powerful as it was.\n\nIf anyone asked, Han Sen could just tell them, \u201cYou want to know why? Unban the skill and you can find out.\u201d\n\nWith Bai Yishan there to explain the skill\u2019s intricacies, everyone\u2019s desire to learn this skill only continued to increase.\n\nStill, Han Sen was being misleading. The reason Yin Yang Blast had been so useful in defeating the shura prince was due to Han Sen\u2019s simulation of Bao\u2019er\u2019s energy flow. Without that, even Yin Yang Blast wouldn\u2019t have stood against the might of Yu Tuoshan.\n\nThe close-quarter combat skills of the shura were incredible. Using Yin Yang Blast the way Han Sen had would fail for all the others.\n\nAfter Yu Tuoshan was healed, they all went off to the crystallizer ruins as planned.\n\nBut the word of their battle spread quickly throughout the Alliance.\n\nZhou Ping had made sure to record the stream, and he distributed the highlights of the fight to his close friends in the Alliance.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t wished for it to be widely distributed, but the fight was so amazing, his friends couldn\u2019t help but share it as much as they could. It didn\u2019t take long at all for it to go viral. And what made it even more sensational was the fact that it had originally been recorded by a shura and had leaked from a stream in shura territory.\n\nBecause of confidentiality agreements, humans weren\u2019t supposed to leak this.\n\nBut someone had the balls to, and once it was uploaded to Skynet, there was no chance of recovering it. Needless to say, everyone in the Alliance was shocked.\n\nThe two fighters in the video were recognizable, too; the human, in particular. That was Han Sen, and most people were familiar with him.\n\nWhat made the video so shocking was Han Sen\u2019s age, not just his already-prestigious identity.\n\nA young human had beaten a third-rank shura. It was all so very glorious.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s reputation was now even higher than a number of demi-gods. He was given a new nickname: The Strongest Genius in the Alliance."
