If I give you Galaxy Sand, what guarantee do I have that you\u2019ll let Speechless go?\u201d Clear Sea King was not mad, and he spoke in a level voice.\n\n\u201cGive me Galaxy Sand, and I will take you to her,\u201d Han Sen said implacably.\n\n\u201cUntil I see her, you\u2019re not getting anything,\u201d Clear Sea King said.\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cThen you should just kill me! I can tell you that Speechless is somewhere on this planet. Give me Galaxy Sand and I will take you to her. Otherwise, I won\u2019t make any deals.\u201d\n\nClear Sea King asked Han Sen, \u201cSpeechless is really still somewhere on this planet?\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not speak. He merely smiled.\n\nClear Sea King asked him a few more questions, but all Han Sen did was smile. He eventually realized Han Sen was not willing to say anything more.\n\nClear Sea King stopped his questioning and returned to Battle King\u2019s lobby.\n\nHan Sen was not in a rush, and he continued waiting where he was. He knew Battle King was going to resume a search across the whole planet\u2014a search that would conclude with no results. Clear Sea King would come back and talk to him again.\n\nSeven Spirit was dead now, so Speechless was the Buddha\u2019s next hope for a deified elite. Burning Lamp Alpha greatly supported her now, so he couldn\u2019t allow anything to happen to her.\n\nA day later, Clear Sea King came back to Han Sen and asked him, \u201cSpeechless is still on this planet, you say?\u201d\n\nYes. Give me the Galaxy Sand and I will take you to her. The trip will take less than half an hour,\u201d Han Sen said matter- of-factly.\n\nClear Sea King looked at Han Sen and felt strange. A normal Viscount shouldn\u2019t have been able to keep such calm composure in front of a hostile King.\n\n\u201cWhy even take Speechless?\u201d Clear Sea King asked.\n\n\u201cBecause you have put Little Seven in your sights,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cAmitabha! That is Battle King\u2019s business. This is none of our business,\u201d Clear Sea King said.\n\n\u201cSpeechless told me that you are snapping up Meka babies for the restoration of some deified weapon,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nClear Sea King frowned. This confirmed to him that Dollar had indeed taken Speechless. Aside from Clear Sea King himself, only Speechless knew about the need to fix-up a deified item. Not even Battle King knew when he was buying the Meka for.\n\nWhile Clear Sea King sat in silence, Battle King\u2019s voice rang in his ear. \u201cIf Speechless is indeed on this planet, you can agree to his demands. I will make sure he doesn\u2019t earn a single grain of sand. Otherwise, I take full responsibility.\u201d\n\nBattle King knew Clear Sea King had yet to make a decision because he still suspected that Battle King had something to do with the kidnapping. So, Battle King had to show that he was innocent in all this.\n\nHe was also confident that Dollar couldn\u2019t escape with the Galaxy Sand that had been reserved for him.\n\nAfter hearing Battle King, Clear Sea King did not hesitate to say to Han Sen, \u201cTake me to Speechless and we will conduct this trade.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Clear Sea King and smiled. He didn\u2019t speak, but it was obvious what he wanted.\n\n\u201cI will give you Galaxy Sand, but you have to promise me that Speechless is on this planet.\u201d Clear Sea King stared at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYes, I told you. It\u2019ll be a half-hour walk. Do you think I can walk off this planet in thirty minutes?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nClear Sea King looked at Han Sen for a while. He eventually placed a box on the table and opened it. There were many shining crystals inside. Each sparkled with the radiance of a diamond. They were so shiny that they were difficult to look at.\n\nThe energy surrounding the items was immediately discemable. Anyone could tell they were some good stuff.\n\nClear Sea King cast a gold light and broke the red chains around Han Sen. Then, the gold light surrounded Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen could move, but the power in his body had been somewhat restricted by that gold light.\n\nHan Sen picked up the box and counted the contents. Then, he placed it in his pocket. \u201cThe amount is correct. Let\u2019s go. I will take you to Speechless. Oh, and yeah, give me back Little Seven.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen stood up and walked to the door.\n\nClear Sea King was next to him, and the guard did not stop Han Sen from leaving.\n\nSomeone sent Little Seven over. Han Sen took Little Seven back and walked out of Battle King\u2019s house. No one stopped him, but Battle King\u2019s people were everywhere in the surrounding radius of a hundred miles. Not even a mosquito could escape their watch.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how this plays out. Once you reveal the Buddha Lady, I will make you suffer.\u201d Battle King\u2019s expression was cruel as he stared at the camera. He couldn\u2019t tolerate anyone committing such a misdeed on his planet. To him, Han Sen was a very dead man.\n\nClear Sea King walked next to Han Sen. He believed Han Sen could not escape with the box of Galaxy Sand.\n\nHan Sen walked slowly, and he looked at the Meka all around. The shops and streets were all roadblocked, so there was no chance of him running.\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to go faster? If I don\u2019t see Speechless in half an hour, the deal is off. Then, I will attack you.\u201d Clear Sea King looked at Han Sen. Han Sen\u2019s calm demeanor was starting to worry him.\n\nClear Sea King did not detect any significant power from him, so he did not believe Dollar could escape.\n\n\u201cHalf an hour is enough.\u201d Han Sen smiled and kept walking.\n\nHan Sen was more popular than a superstar. All the cameras, weapons, and Nobles were trained on him. Even if Han Sen could fly, it was unlikely he\u2019d escape from the planet.\n\nThe allotted time had almost passed. It had almost been half an hour. Han Sen had not even gone down a single street in that time. Battle King frowned and looked at the whole planet.\n\nThere was no other powerful King on the planet, so even Battle King wondered why Han Sen was so calm.\n\nHalf an hour went by, and Clear Sea King stopped Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTime is up; where is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d Han Sen looked at all the Meka warriors, then back at Clear Sea King. He clicked his fingers."
