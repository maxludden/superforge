    "text": "Han Sen had nothing to prepare, so he went back to hunting xenogeneics as he usually did. He also spent time practicing his geno arts.\n\nWhen the Moon God Festival began, Han Sen was sent to Planet Blade. It was one of the eleven primary planets, and Moon God Altar could be accessed from there.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many creatures on Planet Blade, and across the past forty-nine years, only seven to eight could join.\n\nAs the planet moved, a previously invisible planet appeared directly in the center of Narrow Moon. You didn\u2019t need a livestream to see it. All you would have to do was look up and see the planet that hosted the giant palace. It was like a heaven in the cosmos.\n\nBut that beautiful jade palace looked completely different than the planet that hosted it. The planet itself was barren, devoid of mountains and rivers. The empty side of the planet was facing them, too; the palace was located on the opposite side of the sphere.\n\nThe altar teleported you to the other side of the planet, so you\u2019d end up facing the jade palace. You had to walk around it to get inside.\n\nThe Moon God Altar appeared on Planet Blade, and so Han Sen teleported. He wasn\u2019t interested in fighting people, as all he wanted to do was take first place and obtain the rewards he might be entitled to as a result.\n\nWhen Han Sen appeared on the planet, there were many people standing atop a jade platform.\n\nHan Sen started running. That planet wasn\u2019t very big, and it was just a small moon, but running to the other side would still take a long while.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, don\u2019t run!\u201d Han Sen had only just started running when someone called out to him. It was a black-eared Rebate. He was two meters tall, and he was holding a big knife as he ran towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen did not remember seeing this guy before, and so he didn\u2019t think it was likely that the man would have a grudge against him. Why was he coming for Han Sen?\n\nAfter the black-eared man shouted, everyone looked over to see what was happening.\n\n\u201cWhy are you calling out to me?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he kept on running.\n\nThe black-eared man again shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t run! I am Night Giant God. Let\u2019s fight and see which of us has superior knife skills.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing what was said, Han Sen simply sped up. He ignored the man completely.\n\nThe guy was just a Baron, so there was no point in fighting. He thought the concept was ridiculous, and the last thing Han Sen wanted to do was take part in something ridiculous in front of everyone.\n\n\u201cHan Sen! Are you really willing to call yourself Queen\u2019s student? Take a stand and fight me, if you have the audacity!\u201d Night Giant God kept shouting as he chased after Han Sen.\n\nFortunately, Night Giant God was a fighter who focused on power. He had no chance of catching up with Han Sen.\n\nStill, he kept on running and shouting, which made Han Sen depressed. It made Han Sen wonder, \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d\n\nThe young ones that came to the planet were headed in the same direction as Han Sen and Night Giant God. It created a scene of Han Sen and Night Giant God in front, with many people behind them.\n\nMoon God Festival goers usually picked their own path. This was the first time they were all following two people so closely.\n\n\u201cAre these guys hostile to me? When did I offend them?\u201d Han Sen looked back at the commotion, and he saw so many people giving pursuit that it looked like a riptide. He was flabbergasted by what he saw.\n\nMost people had just come to watch. They didn\u2019t plan on fighting Han Sen. They wanted to see how Knife Queen\u2019s student performed.\n\n\u201cKnife Queen is such a high and superior person. Why would she accept a student such as that? He only runs away!\u201d \u2018Yes. What is he so afraid of? I thought he had a King class weapon. Why is he so scared?\u201d\n\n\u201cFight\u201d fight.\u201d\n\nThe creatures that were all watching the streams shouted at their monitors. But they were only watching the livestream, so their voices would not reach the planet.\n\nThe Nobles who witnessed the scene wanted to laugh.\n\nIcebird Duke didn\u2019t look fondly on the event, either. She thought Han Sen\u2019s decision to run was an embarrassment to Yisha.\n\nYisha was impartial to the whole thing, though. She merely watched the video.\n\n\u201cNight Giant God is unable to catch up. Let\u2019s help him!\u201d A Viscount smiled to his friend.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and stop him so they can fight.\u201d A few Viscounts nodded.\n\nThey had gone there to watch the show, and bullying Han Sen had not been their original plan. But now that he was not willing to fight, despite the challenge, they weren\u2019t very happy about it. So, they wanted to stop Han Sen and force him to compete in a battle.\n\nA dozen Viscounts sped up, went past the main group, and came in close to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOld Nine, do you think Han Sen can actually fight Night Giant God?\u201d A beautiful man with gold bunny ears was amidst a group. He was moving casually, leading others that were behind him.\n\nA man with a cow head, who was standing right next to him, said, \u201cI do not know, but Night Giant God is incredibly strong. And he\u2019s practiced Night River King\u2019s skills, too. That is called Fighting River, and it is strong enough to be on par with a Viscount\u2019s power. Its strength is that of five hundred flowers, so that is a very rare number.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you support Night Giant God?\u201d The gold bunny-eared man smiled.\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said the man with a cow head.\n\n\u201cHow about this? Only you and I are Earls. I will be number one, so there\u2019s no point in fighting. How about a wager, then? You bet Night Giant God will win, and I bet on Han Sen winning. If Han Sen loses, then I will gladly give you the first position,\u201d the handsome man said.\n\n\u201cWhat if I lose?\u201d the cow-headed man calmly asked.\n\n\u201cIf you lose, come and train with me on Planet Thunder,\u201d the beautiful man said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d The man with a cow head nodded.\n\nHan Sen was in front, and there, he saw a dozen people coming after him. He felt depressed, and so he thought, \u201cNo way! Is Knife Queen really that unpopular? All these Viscounts now want to bully her student? This is so not fair!\u201d\n\nFortunately, Han Sen was prepared. He had the Teeth Rabbit shoes. He wasn\u2019t going at full speed, but now that the Viscounts were nearing, he sped up a bit.\n\nHan Sen decided to get the number one spot, so he could get the reward first."
