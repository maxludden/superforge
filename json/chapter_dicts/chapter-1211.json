Its mere breath was pungent enough to slay unsuspecting victims, Han Sen reckoned. And as it loomed over them, it looked ready to swallow them all in one mouthful.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s reactions were quick, though. So, grabbing Bao\u2019er, he jumped away with a mighty spring from his muscular legs.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er\u2019s jump landed them in a patch of eggs. Needless to say, many more of them were crushed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem as if the snake could get any angrier, but it did. As the snake wildly thrashed and lunged, Han Sen used his phoenix techniques to dodge. And whenever the opportunity arose, he threw a slash or two back at it with his Phoenix Sword.\n\nIts scales were hardy, though, and each of Han Sen\u2019s strikes was no greater than a scrape that produced a number of sparks.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t as tough as the white ball Han Sen had just been trapped inside, and the sword left behind visible scratches. The attacks made the snake rage even more, though. Now, it was unleashing a strange beam of light.\n\nHan Sen did not know what the beam of light was, but he wasn\u2019t keen on finding out. Instead of attempting a block, he avoided it. Then, he sped up time.\n\nHan Sen still hadn\u2019t been able to formulate a way in which he could combine space and time, but he could make use of them individually. Given the circumstances, speeding up time was the best choice for the situation.\n\nHan Sen dodged the light successfully, but the weirdest thing happened. The light itself looked alive, and it followed Han Sen in his evasion.\n\nAnd as it came for him, the snake slithered up behind Han Sen to attack his back. As Han Sen peered into that light, he thought he could see something inside it. There was a figure, but it was carried and cloaked by a black smoke that swirled as the light moved.\n\nAs the snake came for Han Sen, the snowball ran to the cave\u2019s exit and laughed at the two it had left to a grizzly fate. But when the snowball turned around to leave, the snake\u2019s tail whipped it back inside the cave.\n\nThe snowball\u2019s body was not half as strong as the ball. After it was whacked into a wall, its mouth spilled blood.\n\nHan Sen knew the snake would kill them all in that cave if things didn\u2019t get any better. And a strange thought nagged at the back of his mind. If the eggs all belonged to the snake, why would it attack in the first place?\n\nThey had destroyed a lot of the eggs, but as the snake madly thrashed and struck at them, it was definitely destroying many more. Even if it was cruel enough to attack its babies, Han Sen had crushed a lot of them and not received any announcements.\n\nHan Sen thought there was more to the situation, and the eggs, than met the eye.\n\nThe snake continued to go after him, but the light had changed target and gone towards the snowball. The snowball turned into a white ball to protect itself again. Inside the white ball, the snowball\u2019s speed was much faster, in addition to the grand amount of protection it was granted.\n\nThe snake knew it was hiding, though. So, it left Han Sen for a moment so it could bite the ball. The poison broke it, resulting in the snowball limply falling out again.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, seeing this. His sixteen coin power was not as strong as the snake\u2019s bite, it seemed. But when he looked closer, Han Sen acknowledged it was not the sharpness of the teeth and power of the bite that ruined the white ball, but the venom.\n\nAfter the snowball\u2019s white ball was bitten and the furry fiend rolled out, it was then hit by the light that was still chasing after it. It approached slow and eerily, but the attack it actually delivered was like a missile.\n\nSomething inside the black smoke hit the snowball, and when the black smoke dissipated for a moment, he saw that the smoke had hidden a transparent orb. It was roughly the size of a fist, and transparent like the most perfect of untarnished crystals.\n\nIt was difficult to imagine such a dirty mouth could produce something so clean. The crystal looked pure, but when it hit the snowball, it was like the creature\u2019s fur was instantly melted.\n\nThe snowball formed another white ball in a bid to block the freakish orb, but it didn\u2019t help. The orb struck the white ball and produced a hole inside it.\n\n\u201cThe crystal orb can\u2019t be the snake\u2019s weapon, can it? Is that its gear? Is that the treasure?\u201d Han Sen gasped in shock.\n\nThe snake clearly did not want him to watch this, so when the snake\u2019s beady eyes met with Han Sen\u2019s greedy gaze, it lashed its tail towards him.\n\nHan Sen knew the power of the snake was something supreme, so he dodged the tail and summoned Disloyal Knight and his Little Angel. And then, Han Sen summoned a bunch of coins to suppress the snake. It was covered in them, resulting in it having to move at a much slower pace.\n\nThe venom was very bad for the white, ball-creating cretin, but it wasn\u2019t as much as a threat for Han Sen. The snake was just another, run-of-the-mill super creature to Han Sen.\n\nThe Disloyal Knight used its halo to reduce the snake\u2019s speed even more. The Little Angel flapped her wings after this and delivered a grand slash across the snake\u2019s head as she flew past it. The reptile gushed blood in response.\n\nHan Sen then used his Phoenix Sword to add more damage to the wound the Little Angel had created.\n\nRoar! The snake started to thrash and rage all around, with violent shakes that sent Han Sen flying away. The Phoenix Sword was pulled out, resulting in an even greater cascade of blood.\n\nThe snake lost its composure and bashed the cavern wall, shaking the entire mountain."
