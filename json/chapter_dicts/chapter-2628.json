    "text": "As the two of them returned from their fight in White King City, Han Sen\u2019s heart was unsettled. Both Black King City and White King City gave Han Sen the unsettling feeling that he was being watched by some larger entity.\n\nBut the Sky didn\u2019t have the power to control the White Jade Jing. If someone really did have authority over that place, that would be truly scary. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo had worked together to kill the deified xenogeneic in White King City. News of their feat spread through Sky Palace like wildfire. The next day, when Han Sen decided to go to Black King City, he found Exquisite standing on his little jade island.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, why are you here?\u201d Han Sen knew this was bad news. It had been so long that their agreement had slipped his mind. He hadn\u2019t thought about it when he accepted Lone Bamboo\u2019s invitation to visit White King City.\n\nNow that everyone knew he had helped kill a deified xenogeneic, Exquisite thought it would be a fine time to revisit her arrangement with Han Sen.\n\nIt was just as Han Sen thought. Exquisite eyed him up and down and said, \u201cKilling a deified xenogeneic isn\u2019t the work of a crippled man. You seem to be in fine shape, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nEven though Han Sen wanted to object and claim he wasn\u2019t healed, he knew Exquisite would no longer believe him.\n\nHan Sen fell silent, then nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m almost healed. If you are in this much of a rush, give me a time and date.\u201d\n\n\u201cScheduling something for the future is asking for further delays. How about right now?\u201d Exquisite didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. She was worried that if they continued to drag this out, she would never be able to claim him.\n\n\u201cSure. Where?\u201d Han Sen asked. He knew this had to come to an end at some point.\n\n\u201cThe battle arena.\u201d Exquisite obviously wanted everyone in Sky Palace to attend. Once everyone knew what was going on, it would curtail Han Sen\u2019s ability to delay proceedings any longer.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Han Sen agreed. Then, he went to the arena with Exquisite.\n\nShortly after Han Sen and Exquisite arrived, the news of their bout spread quickly. All of Sky Palace heard what was happening, and a short time later, all of the floating islands around the arena were packed with spectators.\n\nEveryone already knew why Exquisite had stayed in Sky Palace. When it was reported that Han Sen had gone to the arena with Exquisite, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen.\n\n\u201cDo you guys think Brother Han can defeat Exquisite?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he can. Brother Han has an eleven armor talent. Exquisite only has a nine armor talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that. The God Spirit Touch evolved under Han Sen\u2019s influence, so there could have been a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know too little about the way talents are judged. However, everyone knows of the Very High\u2019s gene powers. Although Brother Han isn\u2019t weak, he has mostly relied on xenogeneic treasures to achieve what he has This time, he won\u2019t be allowed to use treasures. That is bad news for Brother Han.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullsh*t! Brother Han doesn\u2019t need treasure, and he can beat anyone at the same level.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Lone Bamboo is here, too\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen Han Yan and the Yun sisters heard the news, they all ran to the stadium. Yun Suyi was a bit worried about it, and she said, \u201cIf Brother Han loses, does that mean he will go to the Very High immediately?\u201d\n\nHan Yan shook her head with a serious expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Big Brother doesn\u2019t know how to lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if he does? The people in the Very High aren\u2019t easy to defeat\u2026\u201d Yun Suyi was still rather worried.\n\nHan Yan looked at Yun Suyi, and she couldn\u2019t keep herself from sighing.\n\nHan Yan could tell Yun Suyi fancied her brother. From the time she spent practicing with Yun Changkong, she had learned that Yun Suyi was a good girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that big brother already has Yanran, and their relationship is amazing.\u201d Han Yan shook her head in dismay. She felt a bit sad for Yun Suyi.\n\nIn the hall, a woman turned to Sky Palace Leader. \u201cIf Han Sen loses, are you going to let him go to the Very High?\u201d \u201cIf he loses, of course he will go,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said coldly.\n\n\u201cLeader, I think you should know how important Han Sen is for the prosperity of Sky Palace,\u201d the woman said with a frown.\n\n\u201cThat is why the Very High want him so badly. Do you think that the Very High\u2019s old man would allow Exquisite to give up on Lone Bamboo so easily?\u201d Sky Palace Leader smiled.\n\n\u201cIf the Very High know that Han Sen can bless people, isn\u2019t that even worse for us? Our plan will become even more difficult to complete,\u201d the woman said.\n\nUpon hearing that, Sky Palace Leader frowned. A while later he said, \u201cThe first seat has been in the Big Silence System for a long time. We don\u2019t know what happened to him. We don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be back, but without him, I don\u2019t believe if this can continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have sent a group of people to the Big Silence System, but in a place like Big Silence, it can be practically impossible to find a single person. Out of every hundred people that go there, it is likely only one will return.\u201d The woman sighed.\n\n\u201cWait a bit longer. If this really doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll have to put pressure on Yu Shanxin,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\nThe woman nodded and didn\u2019t say anything further.\n\nSky Palace Leader\u2019s gaze was fixed to the arena. He didn\u2019t say anything, but he was thinking to himself, \u201cMaybe he is a good choice. Although he won\u2019t stand much of a chance, it is better than putting all my eggs in one basket.\u201d\n\nIn the arena, Han Sen looked at Exquisite. Exquisite said emotionlessly, \u201cPer the terms of our agreement, you will not use xenogeneic treasures. You can only use your body and geno arts to fight. If you win, I will leave and never allow the Very High to pester you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I lose, I will follow you to the Very High. I will listen to your orders,\u201d Han Sen said quickly. \u201cGood.\u201d Exquisite nodded. Her expression was chilling. Her third eye slowly opened to reveal the tai chi yin yang eye.\n\n\u201cShe has just come on stage, and she\u2019s already using her Very High Eye. It looks like Exquisite is taking Brother Han seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is rare to see the Very High in a fight, especially when they are still Kings. And even more so to watch them use their Very High Eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just proves Exquisite is desperate to get Han Sen to join the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was me, I would have just followed her and done whatever she said. Your development would benefit so much with the Very High, and you\u2019d be surrounded by beautiful women. Why wouldn\u2019t he want to go? I wonder what goes on in Lone Bamboo and Han Sen\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re just a bottom-of-the-barrel student. Han Sen and Lone Bamboo are geniuses.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at his enemy gravely. They were both ninth-tier Kings. Han Sen wasn\u2019t afraid of any creature, but Exquisite was from the Very High. She had countless geno arts and secret skills in her pocket, so he had to be very careful.\n\nThe moment she opened her Very High Eye, Exquisite became that robotic person again.\n\nShe just stood there, not saying anything or even glancing around. Raw power suddenly rushed down into the arena. The whole place was twisted by some strange energy.\n\n\u201cIs that her real power?\u201d Han Sen squinted slightly. He saw the space around the woman continue to thrash and twist. Although Exquisite was right in front of him, he could barely see her now."
