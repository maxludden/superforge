Some are prototypes of something else\u2014like him.\u201d Old Cat jumped toward one of the crystal tanks, and he spoke with eyes fixed on it.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King looked at Old Cat, and then observed the strange creatures contained within the tank.\n\nHan Sen could not describe what it was. It looked like a human, but a bug at the same time. It had human limbs, but the head had the eyes of a fly, with the multitude of lenses.\n\nAnd while the limbs were like a human\u2019s, the joints were those of bugs. It looked very weird.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a disgusting bug.\u201d After Old Cat said that, he leaped onto the tank and began slapping it with a paw. He obviously intended to break it open.\n\n\u201cAre you ready? Dead or alive, it doesn\u2019t matter: behead the thing as soon as you are able to,\u201d Old Cat said to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Han Sen was in agreement Pang!\n\nThe crystal tank broke, and the liquid and the bug man came spilling out.\n\nHan Sen did not say a word. He simply summoned the white geno armor, and with his hand like a blade, struck the neck of the creature.\n\nThe hand, now clad in the gauntlets of the armor, made a metallic striking noise when it hit. Han Sen\u2019s power and geno armor had only been able to make a slight scuff on its neck.\n\nFortunately, the bug-man showed no reaction. It looked to be already dead. But just to be safe, Han Sen gave it another hundred cuts until he was able to break its shell.\n\nThe meat inside was like jam, and there was no blood. It looked like it had been dead for quite some time.\n\nGod knew how many times Han Sen had to hit it after that, but eventually, the head was lopped off. As he worked on it, he thought to himself, \u201cThis thing is so tough! Thankfully, it is dead. If it wasn\u2019t, this would be quite a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Sen, according to the terms of our deal, if it was dead when we found it, the item we came for belongs to me. You\u2019ll hold up your end of our bargain, correct?\u201d Old Cat saw the bug-man\u2019s head fall off and quickly jumped on it to speak.\n\n\u201cFine. Suit yourself.\u201d Han Sen did not plan on stealing from him, so he just walked back a few steps and watched the Old Cat. He was keen to see what he was going to obtain.\n\nOld Cat used his claws to scratch away at the bug-man\u2019s armor. A deep crack was instantly formed, and that gave Han Sen quite the shock.\n\nHan Sen knew Old Cat was not weak, but the action it had just performed was rather shocking.\n\nEven if Han Sen used the glove, he knew he\u2019d have much trouble trying to break the shell. It wouldn\u2019t have been easy. Old Cat was certainly much stronger than he was letting on, and much stronger than Han Sen\u2019s own estimation.\n\nOld Cat\u2019s claws were sharper than a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, that was for sure. In no time at all, he was peeling the creature open. And before long, pulled back a paw that was holding something green.\n\n\u201cWhat is that? A stone?\u201d Han Sen looked right at the item in Old Cat\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThose are its guts.\u201d Old Cat looked so happy to have obtained the jade-looking guts.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t see where the cat put it, but he still asked, \u201cThey look like rocks, not organs. What are they truly for?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThis is good stuff. You\u2019ll know all about it once you get out. With how you are now, you won\u2019t understand.\u201d After Old Cat dug up the guts, he ended his search. He jumped and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, there is nothing left.\u201d\n\nXie Qing King, meanwhile, wasn\u2019t feeling too good about this. He said, \u201cWhile we\u2019re here, shouldn\u2019t we explore more of this strange place?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think we have come here to sightsee? You\u2019ll die if you explore anymore.\u201d Old Cat rolled his eyes and started walking out\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King looked at each other, and then followed after Old Cat, so they could be led back to where they had initially come from.\n\nThe three of them walked past the greenhouse, and as they passed it, Old Cat hunkered a little and asked, \u201cDid you touch the stuff in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were with you. You know that we didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking across the greenhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone has been digging in the soil.\u201d Old Cat stared at the disturbed earth.\n\nHan Saw it, too. It was like a freshly dug grave, with soil churned up everywhere.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t dig this, did you?\u201d Han Sen asked, with a frown.\n\n\u201cIf I did, why would I ask?\u201d Old Cat madly rebutted.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you or us two, might there be other creatures around? And if that isn\u2019t possible, maybe the thing buried dug its own way out,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\nHan Sen and Old Cat looked glum. No matter what the case was, this was bad news.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d After Old Cat said that, he started to run.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King ran as well. They ran for a while, but eventually, their faces fell. They had run dozens of miles, but they hadn\u2019t escaped the vicinity. They found that they had walked in a loop, ending up back at the greenhouse and the fresh hole.\n\nIt gave them a very bad feeling. They looked around, but it was all quiet. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything else there that was alive.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Aura could not feel the presence of other creatures. But they fell silent and went to examine the deep hole.\n\n\u201cKeep going!\u201d Old Cat told them to keep going, and so they did. This time, however, they walked faster.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the three of them ended up back at the greenhouse.\n\n\u201cHow can this be happening?\u201d Xie Qing King wasn\u2019t afraid, and he was actually quite happy to see the greenhouse again. Han Sen and Old Cat looked at each other and prepared to run, but suddenly, they heard a strange noise.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang! Pang!\n\nThe soil around the grave started to explode. Many more black holes were created, and the entire graveyard looked like one giant beehive."
