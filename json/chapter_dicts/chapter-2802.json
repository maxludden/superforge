    "text": "After Han Sen\u2019s meter went past 100 and kept on increasing, the scale was still sinking. It was not going back up. Apparently, the counterweight was unable to balance out the crimes he had committed.\n\n\u201cDestroying an entire race can lead to a counterweight of only 100, so what did this guy do?\u201d Bai Wanjie frowned as he peered at the counterweight on the right.\n\nThe number on the scale was now over 200. This kind of sin was reserved for the greatest of villains across the entire universe.\n\nThe number on the counterweight increased quickly. It made Bai Wanjie\u2019s heart start to shake. Before long, it was already over 500. That kind of number had to make him the evilest person in the universe. No one else had ever reached such a figure.\n\nThe counterweight was still increasing. The left plate, where Han Sen was, was still sinking. It was scary.\n\n\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Bai Wanjie was shocked. Although the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye wouldn\u2019t kill things, it suppressed the sinner. Under the weight of a sin this big, the person\u2019s body should have been crushed and destroyed by now.\n\nThe old man who was kneeling on the floor suddenly raised his head. He looked at Han Sen on the scale. His expression started to look strange.\n\n\u201cOld Iron, can you stop the trial?\u201d Bai Wanjie asked. \u201cWhen the real trial comes, I am afraid that if this keeps going, he will not be unable to withstand the trial\u2019s power. It will crush his body.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, but the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye cannot be controlled by others,\u201d the old man coldly said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be controlled by anyone. Even if he is very sinful, he won\u2019t be killed. He will just be suppressed.\u201d\n\nWhen the old man said that, Bai Wanjie did not say anything more. He kept watching the counterweight\u2019s number increase. Every time the number jumped, it made Bai Wanjie\u2019s heart jump.\n\nThe number on the counterweight soared over 1,000. The old man\u2019s face changed. When the second ancestor had slain the butterfly elite, that butterfly elite\u2019s sin was only 1,000 to 2,000. That was the villain of that generation. It was hard to find another like that in recent times.\n\nThe old man looked at Bai Wanjie and asked, \u201cIs it really like you described? Is this xenogeneic from the Space Garden?\u201d He was shocked by this level of crime.\n\n\u201cI asked Holy Pirate to capture him from the Space Garden, so I suppose he was correct,\u201d Bai Wanjie replied.\n\n\u201cHoly Pirate is not a man who goes against his word. If he agreed to the task, this should be the correct target. But if this is a son of the Space Garden, why is he deemed to be so evil?\u201d The old man raised his head as he spoke. He saw that Han Sen\u2019s body was chained up like a prisoner.\n\nThe old man\u2019s eye looked rather purple. He looked at Han Sen, who was on the scale. He shook his head and said, \u201cWeird. It is so weird\u2026 I cannot see through his body. Are two extreme bodies that powerful?\u201d\n\nBai Wanjie\u2019s heart jumped. He suddenly thought of something.\n\n\u201cMister White said this xenogeneic was not just a son of the Space Garden. They say he is very talented. There is something special that gave him this body. At one point, the Space Garden was full of green light. At the same time, the god spirit was killed and the geno hall appeared. Is that miracle connected to the god spirit that was killed? Was the god spirit that was killed the Space Garden itself? Did the Space Garden absorb the god\u2019s personality and create a special xenogeneic?\u201d As Bai Wanjie spoke, his belief in such a possibility became more real. His heart raced faster.\n\n\u201cIf things are truly like that, I just need to tame this son. I can use his power to suppress the Space Garden and get the god\u2019s personality. Then, I will be made a god spirit\u2026\u201d he thought. Bai Wanjie started to think this truly was a huge opportunity.\n\n\u201cWith this much sin, I bet he must have slain a god.\u201d Bai Wanjie could see the counterweight number continue to increase. It made him put more stock in what he had been predicting.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand\u2026 Three thousand\u2026\u201d The counterweight\u2019s number was breaking the limits. Even the old man was visibly shocked. He had never seen a creature\u2019s sin be this high. This had never happened before.\n\n\u201cThis xenogeneic\u2026 He does seem a bit weird\u2026 Should we stop the trial, then?\u201d The old man looked at Bai Wanjie as he spoke. With such a grand amount of sin, not even he knew if something bad might happen.\n\nNormally, no one controlled the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye, and it would not kill anyone. For this much sin, the trial was going to be something scary. There was the possibility that this xenogeneic would be crushed.\n\nThey were unsure whether the calculation of his sin would stop and his trial would start. If the trial did not have enough power and was done a second time, they would have to wait a month until the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye could be used again.\n\nThinking of the Space Garden and having a god\u2019s personality there waiting for him, he could not hold his horses.\n\n\u201cOld Iron, I thought you said if no one controls the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye, it would not kill anyone,\u201d Bai Wanjie said.\n\n\u201cYeah, that is how it is supposed to work. It really is like that. In the past, there has never been a creature this sinful.\u201d Old Iron did not keep speaking.\n\n\u201cIf things are like that, let us just wait longer.\u201d Bai Wanjie went silent.\n\n\u201cFour thousand\u2026 Five thousand\u2026 Six thousand\u2026\u201d The sin meter increased its speed. It made the old man\u2019s face change. He had never heard of such a sinful creature before.\n\nBai Wanjie\u2019s heart was shaking. He said to the old man. \u201cOld Iron, let\u2019s just end this and go to the trial. I am afraid that if this keeps going, his body will not be able to withstand the force of the trial.\u201d\n\nThe old man nodded. He stood up and planned on walking up to the scales. Pang! The chain on the left side, which connected the plate to the scale, suddenly broke.\n\nThe left side broke, and the right side fell. It meant the scale that represented justice had suddenly broken.\n\nThe black and white light that shot out of the statue\u2019s eyes was still carrying on. It kept Han Sen in the air. The other side of the black scale was also hovering in the air. The numbers were still increasing, and they were increasing faster than before.\n\nAmid their shock, the old man and Bai Wanjie saw Han Sen\u2019s score of sin pass the 10,000 mark.\n\nWhen the scale\u2019s sin number hit 10,000, it stopped increasing. The black and white light from the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye still hadn\u2019t stopped. There was no sign of a trial going on. It was still shining on Han Sen.\n\nThe old man was shocked. He did not know what was going on. He had no idea why the sin meter had stopped. Furthermore, there was no trial. This had never happened before.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean the creature\u2019s sin cannot be measured more than this? But the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye can only display 10,000 at most!\u201d The old man and Bai Wanjie shared the same thought of this possibility.\n\nPang!\n\nSuddenly, the second ancestor statue that held the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye was shining. The eyes of the sculpture exploded out of their sockets."
