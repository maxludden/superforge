It would twist like a vortex and swallow whatever came near. If Han Sen was pulled inside, he\u2019d be killed. The occurrences of someone surviving a black hole were rare.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be sad if Han Sen died, but his death would result in her own. And of course, she couldn\u2019t allow that.\n\nMing Xing Emperor was cocky and boisterous, and he loudly proclaimed, \u201cYou were a fool to employ time and space before, as I am the ruler of them.\u201d\n\nBut after that, a gold blade came flying out of the black hole. It was carried by a human hand. Then, Han Sen and his ever-cool, calm, and composed face were standing before Ming Xing Emperor.\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d Ming Xing Emperor\u2019s face changed, and he wished to quickly cast another black hole.\n\nBut it was too late for him to do so, for the gold sword had already hit him.\n\nHan Sen vanished once more and reappeared directly behind the spirit.\n\nMing Xing Emperor was frozen, acknowledging the slip he had made. His eyes were open wide in fright, as if they had been pinned in place.\n\nRoar!\n\nMing Xing Emperor\u2019s black dragon screamed, as the mighty beast felt its entire body split in two. It collapsed to the ground. Ming Xing Emperor\u2019s body was sliced in two as well, sending him right back to the spirit stone where he first started.\n\nBerserk Super Creature Black Dragon killed. Beast soul gained. The flesh of this creature is inedible, but you may harvest its Life Geno Essence. Consume its Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was silence. No one understood how Han Sen had managed to survive the traversal of a black hole, and many rubbed their eyes to ensure they had not been seeing things. Ming Xing Emperor really had been killed, just like that.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t just strong in body, his attacks were lethal, too. He had killed five emperors so far, with each being felled by a single strike. People started to believe they had stepped on the toes of a human who was even stronger than Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir.\n\nNo other spirit dared approach this time, knowing they\u2019d each likely meet the same grizzly end that had been delivered to the others.\n\nMoment Queen herself was in utter shock by the frightening power Han Sen had demonstrated.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the skills of space and time that were excellent, it was who he was. Every aspect of him had been honed and refined. He was a fierce warrior unlike any she had seen before.\n\nWhen Moment Queen was at her strongest, she was nowhere near Han Sen\u2019s level of might and strength. He was operating on a whole different field of play.\n\n\u201cHow did he manage to do that?\u201d Moment Queen asked herself, as she looked at him with wide-eyed surprise. She was entirely still, having been stunned so severely.\n\n\u201cHe traversed the black hole. He went into it and came out of it,\u201d Flower Empress said. Her voice was dull.\n\nThe woman did not say a single word now. Perhaps this was unexpected even for her, and she too was in shock.\n\nGu Demon Emperor frowned and said, \u201cIt is just as No God Emperor said; he is horribly strong. We will have to wait until Ruin Emperor gets here before trying again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d the three-eyed spirit said.\n\nNo God Emperor looked at him, unsure of what he meant by this.\n\nThe three-eyed spirit, acknowledging their confusion, eased their wonder by saying, \u201cLook at that colorful ship; if East Empress was willing to help, this would be an easy task. And if we all fight together, striking at the same time, we should be able to get him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll fight. She herself has no grudge against Godslayer Luo. And that aside, she is almost a demi-god,\u201d Gu Demon said.\n\n\u201cShe owes me a favor, you know. I\u2019d be willing to call it in,\u201d the three-eyed spirit said.\n\nGu Demon Emperor said, \u201cAsking her would be a fine thing. And you\u2019re right, we might not have to wait for Ruin Emperor, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and ask her, then,\u201d the three-eyed spirit said, before flying over to her ship.\n\n\u201cGreetings, My Empress.\u201d The three-eyed spirit did not set foot on the ship, thinking it would be rude.\n\n\u201cBoard, if you wish to speak,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe three-eyed spirit stepped onto the ship and looked around, telling her, \u201cI have a favor I would like to ask of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpit it out before you drone,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe three-eyed spirit said, \u201cThat human is so arrogant. He makes a mockery of us by killing us repeatedly. He rivals the strength of Godslayer Luo, and so I would like to ask that you join us in a collaborative effort to strike, all at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want something done, do it yourself!\u201d Flower Empress butted in to say.\n\n\u201cI would if I could,\u201d the three-eyed spirit said with a faint and embarrassed smile, as all three of his eyes looked away.\n\nEast Empress responded by saying, \u201cI made a vow not to kill. I cannot help you, I apologize.\u201d\n\nThe three-eyed spirit looked disappointed, but then she said something else. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten that which I owe you. Take this; perhaps this will settle the debt.\u201d\n\nAfter that, something just appeared in front of the three-eyed spirit.\n\nHe grabbed hold of it and said, \u201cThank you so much! I will kill this human for the restoration of our pride!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a repayment. What you do with it, and whether you succeed in killing your enemy, is no concern of mine,\u201d East Empress said.\n\nThe three-eyed spirit was not hurt by these words, he just gracefully said his goodbyes and left. He returned to the sides of No God Emperor and Gu Demon Emperor.\n\n\u201cDid she say yes?\u201d Gu Demon Emperor asked.\n\n\u201cNo, but she gave me this. With it, we can summon everyone,\u201d the three-eyed spirit said.\n\nThe two spirits looked at it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a Summoning Bell? What did you do for her that warranted such a gracious gift?\u201d"
