They all slithered back into the black sea, retreating far more quickly than they had attacked. In moments, they had completely disappeared.\n\n\u201cWhat were those things?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart was confused. He looked at the purple copper jian. The jian was so weird. It only seemed to be capable of effecting the monster he had defeated. There must have been some sort of problem with it.\n\nWhen Han Sen first saw the big monster surrounded by the smaller snakes, he had theorized that they were essentially the same being. If that was true, then the purple copper jian should have been able to damage the snakes as well as the larger monsters.\n\nBut Han Sen had tried to strike the snakes many times, and they completely ignored the purple light. Something strange was going on.\n\nHan Sen looked at the white tiger. It was likely that only the tiger knew the secrets of the purple copper jian. But the white tiger had no interest in talking with Han Sen, in addition to the fact that it couldn\u2019t talk, anyway.\n\nAs this was going on, the white tiger began to chase the remaining snakes off of the island. And as it moved, it released a mushroom rain. When the mushroom spores landed on the snakes, mushrooms would grow on their bodies, sucking the moisture out of the snakes and leaving them as desiccated husks.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t completely understand what had happened, Han Sen knew that killing the big monster had been a good thing for them. Plus, he had gotten the weird purple copper jian out of the deal.\n\nOnce they were rid of the snakes, Han Sen tried talking to the white tiger on numerous occasions. He wanted to know if there was a way out, but he also wanted to learn more about the purple copper jian. The white tiger would only ever meow twice and shake its head in response. Han Sen couldn\u2019t speak the tiger\u2019s language, but he understood that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to help.\n\n\u201cDoes he not know, or does he just not want to spill the beans?\u201d Han Sen looked at the white tiger and frowned.\n\nAfter that, though, the white tiger was never hostile toward them. It had no intention of harming them now. It would sometimes draw near and listen to whatever they were talking about.\n\nHan Sen noticed that the white tiger seemed to be spying on him in particular. It wasn\u2019t hostile, but the way its eyes followed him around was quite weird. Han Sen couldn\u2019t guess what the white tiger wanted, though.\n\nThe creature\u2019s gaze was neither hostile nor friendly. The way the tiger looked at Han Sen was familiar, but he couldn\u2019t tell what was familiar about it.\n\n\u201cWhatever. As long as he doesn\u2019t provoke me\u2026\u201d Han Sen put the white tiger out of his mind, and after everything that had happened, he was exhausted. So, he teleported back home. Holding Ji Yanran in his arms, he slept until morning.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Before Han Sen woke up, he heard a scream. It shocked him out of his slumber. He looked at Ji Yanran and nervously said, \u201cDarling, what happened? Is there an enemy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Ji Yanran stammered, standing on the bed and pointing at Han Sen with her eyes wide. She said \u201cyou\u201d three times, but she couldn\u2019t say anything more.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Han Sen was shocked, so he quickly looked down at his body.\n\nHan Sen was wearing shorts, and he was topless. His muscles were like wet steel. His body was perfect.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with perfection? My body is still super fit. Did the fact that I\u2019ve become even more handsome scare you?\u201d Han Sen posed before her, flexing cockily.\n\n\u201cYour\u2026 your\u2026 head\u2026\u201d Ji Yanran pointed at Han Sen\u2019s head with her eyes wide open.\n\n\u201cI told you before, when we were in Black Hole Spider\u2019s belly, mushrooms grew on our heads. I removed it before I came back. Has it come back already?\u201d Han Sen asked, and then he touched his head. He froze, his hand still on his head.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what is this\u2026\u201d Han Sen felt something very soft under his fingers.\n\nHan Sen thought of something bad. He teleported in front of Ji Yanran\u2019s dressing table and looked at himself.\n\nHan Sen stared at his reflection, thunderstruck. There was no mushroom on his head, but instead, he was sporting purple fox ears.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are these?\u201d Han Sen asked aloud with shock. Han Sen quickly tried to pull the ears off, but pain lanced through his head as he tugged at them. The purple ears seemed to be a part of him.\n\n\u201cArgh! Your\u2026 your\u2026 your back\u2026\u201d Ji Yanran screamed. Her eyes were now focused lower on Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen was given another fright, and so he looked behind himself. There, he saw a hairy purple tail. It looked very soft.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d Han Sen used his Dongxuan Area to check out his body. There was nothing wrong with him, as far as he could tell. It was like his ears and tail were now a part of his body.\n\nJi Yanran\u2019s eyes opened wide, and she approached Han Sen. She looked frozen as she stared at him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my darling. This is just a small problem. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sort it out right now,\u201d Han Sen comforted Ji Yanran.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cute!\u201d Ji Yanran screamed happily. She hugged him and fondled his fox ears.\n\nLing\u2019er heard the commotion, and she rubbed her eyes and sat up. When she saw Han Sen, she looked so happy. She jumped atop Han Sen\u2019s back and grabbed one of his fox ears while she said, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s so cute!\u201d\n\n\u201cCute, my *ss.\u201d Han Sen felt humiliated. He put Ling\u2019er in Ji Yanran\u2019s arms and turned his attention back to finding out what was going on. He had only just gone to sleep, and he had woken up this way.\n\nHan Sen used all sorts of powers to try to learn more about this issue, but no matter what method he tried, the fox ears and tail weren\u2019t a part of his body. There was no way to remove them.\n\nWith his fitness and recovery powers, even if he tore them off by force, they would grow back.\n\n\u201cHoney, if you can\u2019t get rid of them, it\u2019s okay to keep them,\u201d Ji Yanran said with a smile.\n\n\u201cYes, yes! You can!\u201d Ling\u2019er agreed fervently, holding her bottle as she looked at Han Sen. She kept nodding as she sipped from her bottle.\n\n\u201cHoney, you shouldn\u2019t hurt your body. Just keep it like this,\u201d Ji Yanran said.\n\n\u201cYes, yes! Keep them!\u201d Ling\u2019er followed with a nod.\n\n\u201cYour parents gave you this body, so you should cherish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes! Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what you become, we will both love you. You should stop touching them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. We love you.\u201d\n\nThe two of them kept smiling as they tried to convince Han Sen, who was currently feeling as if he was in a very dire situation.\n\n\u201cThe jian\u2026 it must be the purple copper jian. I was fine before, and this only happened when I retrieved this thing.\u201d Han Sen pulled the purple copper jian from Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nThere was nothing weird about it, though. The weapon rested quietly in Han Sen\u2019s hands. The symbols didn\u2019t react in any way.\n\nBut Han Sen noticed something unusual. His fox ears and tail were the same purple color as the jian."
