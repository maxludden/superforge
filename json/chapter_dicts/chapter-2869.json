    "text": "\u201cJust using a hand to flip space and changing fate is very powerful.\u201d Han Sen felt a chill while watching this. He was suspicious about this Very High Leader being the person he went back in time to see. The performance gave people different feelings. \u201cThe Very High Sense practice Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level. It won\u2019t just flip space. It can even swap galaxies, change the sky, and swap the ground. It is not difficult, but no one of the Very High has reached that level before. People can swap a little planet but changing the universe\u2019s power is impossible.\u201d God paused and went on to say, \u201cFor the Very High to be able to practice to this level is something very rare to see in their history. Concentrating space into his hands, even god spirits like Sky Armor God could not do something similar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we break that power?\u201d Han Sen asked. He had never seen power like this before, so he did not know what to do about it.\n\n\u201cIn space, his hands will keep energy flowing,\u201d God casually said. \u201cThere are only two ways to get free. One method has you use your fastest speed to travel faster than a galaxy and escape the danger space. The other method is to blow up that space, thus resulting in nothing tying you up.\u201d\n\nJust as God said that, a beast\u2019s roar shocked the sky and shook the universe. In the space that Very High Leader had clutched, Golden Growler was getting bigger.\n\nIn the eyes of the audience, the space Very High Leader was holding was just the size of a fist. It was actually an area of space. Golden Growler\u2019s body was getting bigger. It was filling up that whole space. Then, there was a pang sound. A scary gold body blew up the space inside Very High Leader\u2019s hands. It broke out from the palm, becoming an extremely scary giant gold giant beast. The planets next to them were as small as a waterdrop.\n\nRoar!\n\nGolden Growler roared. The whole of the god geno list was shaking. The audience\u2019s hearts were shocked. They felt the roar exhibit an aura of murder and rage. The creatures without any courage felt their legs go weak. They fell. The next second, Golden Growler opened its mouth at Very High Leader. Very High Leader was so tiny next to Golden Growler. There was no way he was going to block the big, scary beast\u2019s attack. Very High Leader\u2019s expression did not change. His hands came together and started spinning. Then, something unbelievable happened.\n\nIt was like Golden Growler\u2019s lower body had a spinning wheel. Its body weirdly turned 180 degrees. The big mouth that was going to Very High Leader changed direction.\n\nGolden Growler turned around to bite him again, but Very High Leader spun his hands. Suddenly, the sky and the earth swapped. He and Golden Growler swapped positions in space, enabling Golden Growler\u2019s biting power to miss.\n\nMany creatures watching the fight were frozen, which included Han Sen. This method to swap the sky and change the ground had never been heard of before.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder the Very High is the No. 1 race in the big universe. This method is like God.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say this is stronger than God. Sky Armor God, who was killed by Dollar, was nothing much. He was not as powerful as Very High Leader.\u201d \u201cNot bad. Not bad. Very High Leader is the strongest person in the universe. That Golden Growler only has invincible giant power. Is he going to be trapped by Very High Leader?\u201d Upon seeing this, Han Sen was very shocked. Very High Leader\u2019s skills were similar to his Dongxuan Area, butt Very High Leader\u2019s power far exceeded his strength. Han Sen was able to learn something from Very High Leader\u2019s skill. Very High Leader being able to do this makes my control of the universal cogwheels more detailed. I should be able to do the same, but his method is obviously supported by a geno art. I do not have a geno art. If I am just going to have to explore this on my own, it will be kind of annoying.\n\nHan Sen felt very conflicted about this. He hoped that Very High Leader would perform this a few more times so he could learn the techniques he needed to.\n\nHe also wanted Golden Growler to find a way to break it. Otherwise, being played like that was useless, even if one did have a lot of power.\n\n\u201cTo be able to practice Very High Sense to this extreme, Very High Leader is not too bad.\u201d God seemed to admire the spectacle, but that power clearly did not surprise him.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He looked at God and asked, \u201cWhy do I think Very High Leader is more powerful than Sky Armor God. Is it an illusion?\u201d\n\nGod laughed. \u201cIt is not an illusion. Sky Armor God wanted his god personality back. He forced himself to combine with Deep Abyss Knight, who was only a butterfly. When Sky Armor God combined with him, he forced it to true god class. At the end of the day, Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s body was not enough. Also, Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s abilities were different from Sky Armor God\u2019s. It was hard for Sky Armor God to use all of his power. If he combined the true god class with a body of the same element, it would have been far more difficult for you to win. But talking about real power here, Very High Leader might not be weaker than Sky Armor God. To see which is greater, you would have to wait for Very High Leader to go to the geno hall. He will have to battle Sky Armor God to find out.\u201d\n\nAfter God said all that, Han Sen felt nervous.\n\nGolden Growler\u2019s body and power looked very mighty. He was almost invincible. He was much stronger than Han Sen and Han Sen\u2019s body now.\n\nNow, he was unable to touch Very High Leader. It did not matter how strong he was. Golden Growler kept trying to consume Very High Leader, who kept using his skills to change the sky and swap the ground. Very High Leader did not move an inch, but Golden Growler was not even able to ruffle his clothing.\n\nUpon seeing this, Zhang Xuandao complimentarily said, \u201cThis old man is getting stronger.\u201d \u201cAfter all, he is Very High Leader,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt is not a surprise to learn he has this sort of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like this will be his final fight,\u201d Zhang Xuandao said. \u201cSuccessful or not, he will be going to the geno hall very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Very High have had many people enter the geno hall, but none ever come back,\u201d the woman said. \u201cDo you think he will be able to return?\u201d \u201cIf I knew that, I would not be just sitting here. I would have gone to the geno hall and start killing,\u201d Zhang Xuandao sighed and said, \u201cIt is a shame that the rules for the top 100 of the geno god list are so weird. I thought I could fight him, but I can only challenge him once. I am afraid I am not going to find out.\u201d\n\nGolden Growler kept attacking uselessly, so he stopped jumping. He stood in space, looked at Very High Leader, and ceased moving.\n\n\u201cYou may possess the blood of the growlers, but you cannot win,\u201d Very High Leader coldly said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you concede and quit?\u201d \u201cWhy are you waiting? Our Little Mountain Leader never loses.\u201d The green-haired beast was angry. He suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cThis Very High Leader is, admittedly, quite good. The way he changes the sky and swaps the ground is rare to see in the universe.\u201d\n\nThe woman nearby looked serious. She nodded and said, \u201cThe Very High was able to become a high race not just through sheer luck. It looks like Little Mountain Leader has to use that skill. I cannot believe he has to use it in his first fight."
