    "text": "As everyone watched in confusion, the meaning of the two words of Sky Palace exploded, and something flew out into the air.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Yun Suyi, never having heard of anything like this happening before.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Yun Suyi was just as stunned as the rest. She had never heard of a physical item emerging from the sign that held the words of Sky Palace.\n\nAll the rest of the Sky were amazed, as well. The last thing they had expected was for an object to fly out of that sign. They stared at it blankly.\n\nThe thing that flew out of the sign looked like an elephant. It was white like jade, but only one foot long. The elephant\u2019s tusks appeared to be made of crystal.\n\nEveryone looked at that small elephant in befuddlement. They had no idea why it had suddenly appeared there.\n\nThe defensive systems of Sky Palace were rock-solid. It would be impossible for them to be unaware of a xenogeneic hiding out inside that big sign.\n\nThe small white elephant flew over until it was right in front of Han Yan. It then expanded, growing to the size of a mammoth.\n\nStrangely, after the white elephant appeared, the meaning behind the two words of Sky Palace disappeared. The sign went back to normal.\n\nThe white elephant reached out its trunk and wrapped it around Han Yan\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s muscles tensed. He thought the white elephant was going to harm his sister, and he leaped forward. After he took a step forward, though, he realized that the white elephant was just lifting her up to sit on its back.\n\nOnce Han Yan was astride its back, the white elephant turned around and headed deeper into Sky Palace.\n\nSeeing that the elephant wasn\u2019t a threat, Han Sen felt instantly relieved. But still, he made sure to follow closely behind them. Many Sky elders also hurried forward to examine the strange white elephant as it walked farther into Sky Palace.\n\nIt was so weird. No one had known that the Sky Palace sign had a white elephant hiding out in it. The situation was so odd that it was hard to believe.\n\nEven Sky Palace Leader came down for a closer look. He ransacked his mind for an explanation of where the white elephant had come from, but he couldn\u2019t come up with one.\n\nJust by feeling the white elephant\u2019s presence, he could tell that it was a deified creature. A deified creature had been hiding out in that sign, and no one in Sky Palace had known. That was simply embarrassing for the other deifieds inside Sky Palace.\n\nBut they knew immediately that the white elephant must have a long history with Sky Palace, so no one tried to attack it. They followed the white elephant, keen to see what it might do.\n\n\u201cMister Leader, what is this White Elephant?\u201d Han Sen was still worried about Han Yan, and so he asked Sky Palace Leader once the man arrived.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will assure her safety. I won\u2019t allow her to get hurt,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said as he continued to walk.\n\nWhen Han Sen heard him say that, he relaxed a little, but he still didn\u2019t feel calm. He felt even more worried. That was because it sounded as if not even Sky Palace Leader understood what the white elephant was and where it had come from.\n\nAlthough this entire scenario sounded a bit unbelievable-in which a deified creature had resided in Sky Palace without anyone knowing about its existence\u2014this was actually happening.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and followed the white elephant. The white elephant showed no sign of being hostile, though. And it was moving forward at a rather slow pace. Han Yan looked down, observing her mount quizzically. While she was surprised to find herself atop its back, she hadn\u2019t been hurt in any way.\n\n\u201cLittle Yan, are you okay?\u201d Han Sen asked as he followed the white elephant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. Is this some sort of induction ceremony for Sky Palace?\u201d Han Yan asked with curiosity.\n\n\u201cCan you get off its back?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Do you want me to come down?\u201d Han Yan asked.\n\n\u201cYes, come down for now,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Yan flew off of the white elephant\u2019s back. But as soon as she broke contact with the creature, the white elephant\u2019s trunk snatched her and made her sit down again.\n\nThe white elephant didn\u2019t hurt her, however. It placed her down gently and resumed its walk.\n\n\u201cLet her sit there for now. I promise not an ounce of harm will befall a single hair on her pretty head,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said with a squint of his eyes.\n\nA white elephant had flown out of the Sky Palace sign. That was mysterious, to say the least. All of the Sky Palace students thought this was amazing, and they were curious about what the white elephant was.\n\nBut most of the students were eventually stopped and prohibited from following the white elephant. Only the elders and other leaders of Sky Palace were allowed to follow beyond that point.\n\nThe white elephant carried Han Yan through the Sky Palace hall. Then, they came to the gardens of Sky Palace.\n\nThis was where the rulers of Sky Palace had lived down through history. Now, it belonged to the man who was walking next to Han Sen. Ordinary people weren\u2019t permitted entry.\n\nHan Sen and the others followed the white elephant in. It was like a natural garden, with mountains and the smell of grass. It was like a fairy\u2019s grove. Rare xenogeneic plants were scattered about here and there. Just the sight of them made Han Sen want to get out his knife and start cutting\n\nThe big white elephant carried Han Yan to the back of the garden. They went to a wall with a small pond beside it. The wall had two words that were roughly engraved: \u201cOuter Sky.\u201d\n\nThose two words were jaggedly carved. Even though Han Sen didn\u2019t know much about calligraphy, he knew those words had been written by a young man.\n\nBut how could a young man have made an inscription in this place? That was where the rulers of Sky Palace rested. Other people weren\u2019t permitted entry, and they surely couldn\u2019t leave evidence of their presence.\n\nThe white elephant walked in front of the mountain wall, then lowered its trunk into the water. As the water swirled around its trunk, the elephant seemed to be feeling around for something.\n\nEveryone looked at the big white elephant, having no idea what it was doing. After a while, the white elephant lifted its trunk from the water. It was holding something. The object was a box made of jade, and it was a foot long. The onlookers glanced at each other, unsure what the appearance of this random box signified.Sky Palace Leader looked at the jade box and frowned. He had an idea of what the box might be, but he wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nThe white elephant lifted its trunk and passed the jade box to Han Yan. And then, it lay down next to the pond and closed its eyes. It looked as if it had gone to sleep.\n\n\u201cHan Yan, come over here,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said to Han Yan, who had just received that box.\n\nHan Yan saw Han Sen nodding. So, she got off of the white elephant. This time, the white elephant didn\u2019t respond. It allowed Han Yan to move away with the box in her hands.\n\n\u201cOpen the box,\u201d Sky Palace Leader told Han Yan.\n\n\u201cPalace Leader, will there be danger inside the jade box?\u201d Han Sen asked worriedly.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sky Palace Leader shook his head, a strange expression on his face.\n\n\u201cIs this\u2026\u201d Yun Changkong\u2019s face changed. He seemed to come to a realization, and he looked at the jade box in astonishment."
