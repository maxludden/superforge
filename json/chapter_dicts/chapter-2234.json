    "text": "Han Sen moved his body and summoned both sets of dragon wings\u2014the ones on his back and the ones behind his ears. He held Bao\u2019er and evaded Night River King\u2019s black water wheel attack.\n\nNight River King looked crazy, and he roared, \u201cLet\u2019s send them to hell so they can wait for you.\u201d\n\nThe pair of Moon Wheel Blades did not lessen in their strength, and they kept creating scary black water wheels to send after Ji Qing and the others.\n\n\u201cI am afraid you will be disappointed.\u201d Han Sen looked at him mockingly.\n\nPang!\n\nA gold shield arose from Han Yan. It was the fourth Demon Bug King Bai Sema. It was not damaged by his attack, as the gold Bai Sema protected them and prohibited the black water wheels from reaching them.\n\nMany giant black water wheels came down on the gold Bai Sema, spinning in a bid to cut through it. But try as they might, they could not cut through the surface of the new gold Bai Sema.\n\n\u201cDamn it! He still has one more of those treasures?\u201d Night River King felt so angry. And in addition to that, he felt hopeless and sad.\n\nHe had done everything he could to try and kill Han Sen, but every attempt had failed. He hadn\u2019t even managed to hurt him in the least. The presence of the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema had hurt his confidence quite a bit. Without the help of the Ancient Warrior Statue, his power was not enough to break through the shield. His plan had completely failed. No one expected Han Sen to possess four of those treasures, and no one expected the tricolored shield to block a deified\u2019s attack.\n\nBut quickly, Night River King did find himself some hope, and that was because he saw Han Sen coming for him. He hadn\u2019t hidden himself inside the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema for protection.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have a fifth shield treasure.\u201d Night River King looked ugly as he roared. His body exploded with a burst of power as black water started popping off in every direction. The Moon Wheel Blade he was wielding was carrying a black water wheel toward Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s dragon wings flapped. He teleported past the black water wheel and rushed to Night River King.\n\nNight River King was so angry, and his blade was so fast. The black water wheels appeared everywhere. They were headed for Han Sen with an ardent desire to cut him up into pieces.\n\nHan Sen cast his Dongxuan Aura and used the Purple-Eye Butterfly, and then he teleported again. His speed and power wouldn\u2019t be up to Night River King\u2019s par.\n\nDodging Night River King\u2019s attacks were very difficult, of course. He had to count on his judgment and prediction abilities and use Break Space Flash to evade each and every black water wheel. By doing so, Han Sen came nearer and nearer to Night River King.\n\nTen thousand meters\u2026 five thousand meters\u2026 three thousand meters\u2026 two thousand meters\u2026 one thousand meters\u2026\n\nNight River King\u2019s mad attacks could not prevent Han Sen from inching his way forward. Finally, when Han Sen was only five hundred meters away from Night River King, Han Sen roared. He held his Ghost Teeth Knife and brought up the demonic knife air. He slashed toward Night River King.\n\n\u201cYou underestimate the power of one who is King class.\u201d Night River King was incredibly angry from Han Sen\u2019s provocations. The Moon Wheel Blade slashed toward Han Sen with a black water wheel spinning like crazy at its tip. It looked as if it were going to cut the world and Han Sen open.\n\nNight River King did not think Han Sen was an equal opponent. Without those horrible shields of his, Han Sen was little more than a cheap ant before him. Now that the ant sought to challenge him, it made Night River King angry, but it also gave him hope. He could not hide the fact that he had come to kill Han Sen. Even if he did kill Han Sen, his teammates would spread word that he had broken the shield and everything, but if he killed Han Sen and retrieved the item Edward wanted\u2026\n\nNight River King could discuss striking a deal with Edward and Ice Blue Knight King. Edward was willing to sacrifice an Ancient God statue for the item he wished to retrieve, so the item must be something good enough to keep him alive.\n\nAs Han Sen\u2019s knife air came to hit the black water wheel, Han Sen put away the knife air and teleported. This time, Han Sen teleported behind Night River King by a distance of about ten meters.\n\n\u201cDeath wish.\u201d Night River King knew exactly where Han Sen had appeared, and the moment Han Sen did appear, he slashed backwards toward him.\n\n\u201cIt was too close,\u201d Night River King thought. He didn\u2019t believe Han Sen could teleport away now.\n\nWhen he slashed, Night River King moved and saw Han Sen exactly there. He had only just finished teleporting, so it was too late to avoid the slash.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d Night River King roared like mad.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er!\u201d Han Sen did not move. His red body floated in the air, and he did not dodge Night River King. He only called Bao\u2019er\u2019s name.\n\nBao\u2019er was sitting on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, and she was clutching a white jade drum. Her little hand hit the drum.\n\nNight River King acknowledged the jade drum was from Planet Jade Drum, and it made his face change. He had spent all his power on the attacks, and he did not have enough reserves to repel the Jade Drum\u2019s sonic power.\n\nBut Night River King did not think a Jade Drum could do much of anything, because it was only Duke class. It was difficult for one to ever be King class.\n\nWith a King class body, he should have totally been able to withstand the Jade Drum\u2019s sonic force and then kill Han Sen. It was okay to allow himself to be hit by the sonic power.\n\nWhile Night River King was thinking, he saw Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand fall upon the Jade Drum, but the Jade Drum was different to the ones he could recall. There was a red scorpion printed on it.\n\nBefore Night River King could think again, though, a loud drum noise sounded inside his head.\n\nDong!\n\nNight River King felt as if his head had been pierced by a steel rod all the way from his head right through his entire body. He felt as if his head were empty, and he could not compose a clear thought after listening to the noise. He brought his hands up to clutch his head as he screamed.\n\nWhile Night River King was broken, the black water wheel that was about to hit Han Sen faded.\n\nAt that close range, a King class elite could not hope to block the power of a Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, especially without a defensive effort. Han Sen knew this because he had tested it while he was on Planet Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cNight River King, our feud really should end here.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife was carrying a scary knife air. It came slashing at Night River King, who was screaming while he clutched his head.\n\nNight River King wanted to kill Han Sen, and Han Sen wanted to kill Night River King.\n\nA scary knife air came across Night River King\u2019s throat. The power could break a mountain, but on Night River King\u2019s neck, it only imparted a light knife mark. Blood was drawn by the blade, but a complete slit of the throat was not achieved.\n\nA King class body was far stronger than a Marquise\u2019s. The slash could not cut through Night River King\u2019s entire neck; it could only just hurt him. But the pain brought Night River King a bit of lucidity.\n\nDong!\n\nBut before Night River King\u2019s head started to run again, another noise was heard. It made Night River King\u2019s head buzz once more. It felt like someone had used a hammer to batter his head and then dig his brain out. He screamed again.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s hand came down on the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, and she did not stop there. Her hands alternated to hit the Jade Drum continuously."
