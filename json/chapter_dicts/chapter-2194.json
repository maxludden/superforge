    "text": "The highly corrosive power of that black water was something like a whetstone. It looked like a grinder that could wear a diamond down into dust. It whirled continuously just outside the blue shield.\n\nNight River King was confident in his Night River Beast God. The geno art didn\u2019t have overwhelming strike power like Yisha_s Teeth powers, which could one-hit-kill almost any enemy.\n\nBut this corrosive and grinding power could destroy King class weapons. Even a deified item could be reduced to dust if Night River\u2019s attack bore down on it for long enough.\n\nNight River King didn\u2019t believe Han Sen\u2019s shield was deified. And even if he did, with Han Sen\u2019s Marquise power, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it at max capacity. Whatever the blue shield was, it wouldn\u2019t last long if Han Sen\u2019s rank was below the item\u2019s.\n\nThis was the rule that applied to all treasures. Night River King believed his power would be able to break Han Sen\u2019s shield and kill him. All he required was time.\n\nNight River King only hoped that no other Narrow Moon elite took notice of his actions before Han Sen was dead. If someone interrupted, that would ruin his night.\n\nSadly, Night River King was woefully uninformed about the differences between a beast soul and a treasure. A Marquise could not make use of all the power of a treasure, that was true. But that did not apply to a beast soul.\n\nA treasure required the power of its user to support its usage, but a user\u2019s power wasn\u2019t needed when it came to a beast soul.\n\nBeneath the black water wheel that was like a countless number of gears all spinning together, the Demon Bug Bai Sema was not incurring a single point of damage.\n\nThe half-deified Demon Bug Bai Sema, when it shrank far enough to only shield one person, provided a defense that could only be defined as insane. No opponent could break through it unless they were half-deified themselves. Only dust could be scraped off its surface.\n\nTo those with King class power, its resilience was mind-boggling.\n\n\u201cNight River King\u2019s power is quite interesting. His attack power isn\u2019t the strongest, but it holds a strong corrosive ability. And it\u2019s shaped to create a grinding action, as well. It\u2019s a pretty smart technique.\u201d Han Sen observed the black water that was spinning like a wheel, and as he did, he walked forward.\n\nThe Bai Sema followed Han Sen\u2019s movement, breaking away from the black water as it went.\n\nNight River King could see the mass of black water moving, and the blue shield was becoming lighter and lighter as it emerged from within. Han Sen was forcing his way out of the Night River Beast God.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful treasure.\u201d Night River King\u2019s face turned dim. He watched as Han Sen broke away from the water with his blue shield and walked away.\n\nBut Night River King seemed to expect this would happen. Unhurriedly, he put his hand to his waist and brought out a black blade. It was serrated, and its shape was like a crescent moon. He lifted it and slashed towards Han Sen.\n\nThe spinning crescent blade carried Night River Beast God power with it, too, and it was headed right for Han Sen\u2019s Demon Bug Bai Sema. The wheel power came against the surface of the Demon Bug Bai Sema hard, and a flurry of sparks flew at the contact. A loud screeching noise accompanied it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how much force you can really repel,\u201d Night River King murmured.\n\nThe crescent blade sent out an unbroken series of slashes, and the black water wheel came down on the blue shield again.\n\nHan Sen ignored it, though. He just kept walking across Planet Blade.\n\nNight River King had been very confident at one point. He would break Han Sen\u2019s shield before anyone else noticed, and when that was done, Night River King would kill him. That way, the matter would be finished. Even if it wasn\u2019t looked upon fondly, no one would bother raising an issue with Night River King\u2019s deed.\n\nPlus, Han Sen wasn\u2019t one of the Rebate. He was an outsider. If everybody hadn\u2019t agreed with this fact, then they wouldn\u2019t have agreed to split Yisha\u2019s legacy items up amongst themselves.\n\nBut the black water wheel that kept pounding the small blue shield was not proving effective. It was like a ferry wheel, grinding uselessly against the water.\n\nNight River King created many of those black water wheels. A lot of destructive power was now focused on the shield, but the blue shield\u2019s appearance hadn\u2019t changed. Han Sen didn\u2019t seem exhausted, either. It was as if he didn\u2019t have to use his own strength to keep the shield up.\n\n\u201cImpossible! No matter what the treasure is, it has to be feeding off his power.\u201d Night River King\u2019s face looked very gloomy. But still, he kept attacking the shield.\n\nAnd try as he might, nothing seemed to work.\n\nMany giant black water wheels hit the shield, making the shield look tiny beneath their mass and weight. After a countless number of them were used, the shield was still there. It was unfathomable, because that amount of corrosive power would have reduced the planet itself to space dust. But the shield still gave off the same blue light, unhindered and unharmed.\n\nNight River King was causing such a ruckus that it was only a matter of time before Moon Wheel King and the others took notice. And they did.\n\n\u201cWhat is Night River King doing? Knife has only just passed away, and already he seeks to kill her only student. What would Night River King\u2019s own student feel?\u201d Moon Wheel King looked grim.\n\nWhen Black-Moon King saw this, he himself looked very dim. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cNight River King, you have abandoned your own honor and tried to kill a student. But look at you: you have failed. You are a complete and utter embarrassment.\u201d\n\nThe few other Kings of Narrow Moon, witnessing the situation, looked on with confused expressions.\n\nThey were all well-acquainted with Night River King\u2019s power. They knew he wasn\u2019t the strongest, but if he had time, he should have been able to grind down a King class weapon.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s blue shield was not even quivering beneath Night River King\u2019s unrelenting attack. The Kings had never seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of treasure is that, though? It has that sort of defense even in the hands of a Marquise?\u201d everyone wondered.\n\nHan Sen stepped off the surface of Planet Blade. Night River King kept trying to kill him, but all his attempts were useless. He couldn\u2019t stop Han Sen from proceeding.\n\nRage and embarrassment warred across Night River King\u2019s face. Despite sacrificing his reputation in front of the other Kings, he hadn\u2019t even managed to mess up Han Sen\u2019s hair. Shame washed through him.\n\nNight River King roared to the sky, and more black water rose from him. His power exploded. His serrated crescent flashed towards Han Sen, who was still rising from Planet Blade.\n\nA flying crescent headed toward Han Sen, carrying the power of the black water behind it. It struck the blue shield with all force. The King class weapon kept spinning against the blue shield. It ground harshly against the shield, emitting many sparks and sounds. It lit up the entire sky.\n\nPlanet Blade was overtaken by the noise and lights, and all the creatures fled as far away as they could. Only the King class elites stayed to watch. Now, many of them saw the sparks in the sky.\n\nThe elites stared at the light show in the sky, which centered on Han Sen encased in his blue shield. Their eyes traced the lines of the crescent with its black water power. They stood in silence for a long moment.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Night River King\u2019s King class weapon? Isn\u2019t that the crescent blade? How\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did Han Sen do to provoke Night River King? What would inspire Night River to attack with the serrated crescent?\u201d\n\nThe sky erupted with sparks like there was an ongoing firework show. The serrated crescent kept grinding. But the Kings could see that Han Sen\u2019s shield had yet to crack, and the jagged teeth of the crescent blade were beginning to\n\nThe toothy crescent blade was going to lose its teeth. And even so, it was unable to break Han Sen\u2019s shield.\n\n\u201cRiver Night Beast God is failing already? It\u2019s really nothing out of the ordinary, huh?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s voice bellowed all across Narrow Moon. He ignored the crescent blade and kept flying with the wind.\n\nNight River King\u2019s eyes were bulging with fury, but he couldn\u2019t stop Han Sen from moving. He saw Han Sen leaving slowly, and as he did, he felt a mixture of hopelessness, shame, and anger. A fire burned in Night River King\u2019s chest, making his blood pulse savagely."
