    "text": "Everyone was frozen. They didn\u2019t know what was going on. Han Sen felt a sharp pain in his heart. He had no clue why the word water had just stopped above him.\n\nThe next second, the symbol on Han Sen\u2019s forehead fired away from him like a cannonball. It whooshed back up into the sky, flying into the leaves at the top of the tree and vanishing.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen was frozen.\n\nEvery royal child and guard in King\u2019s Garden stood as still as stone. They thought they must have been imagining things, and their eyes were opened wide in disbelief.\n\nThe king tree had stood in the center of the Extreme King territory for billions of years. There had never been a Kingese that saw its recipient, then high-tailed it back to where it came from.\n\n\u201cHaha! I cannot go on! I\u2019m laughing too hard! Old Sixteen is way too funny. The Kingese that fell escaped his clutch.\u201d Prince Nineteen held his belly while he laughed, tears of mirth welling in his eyes.\n\nThe water Kingese looked like a horny man, seeing a sexy woman with a great body. It quickly gave chase, but when it got close enough to see her face, it ran away faster than any rabbit.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u201d Bai Ling Shuang was shocked. She hadn\u2019t a clue what was happening.\n\nMiss Mirror squinted her eyes. \u201cIt looks like he isn\u2019t actually Bai Yi. The water Kingese was attracted by the Original Water King Body, but it noticed that there was a problem. And so, it decided to run back. I\u2019m pretty sure he is actually Han Sen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this? A fallen Kingese can go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never heard of something like this happen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince Sixteen looks a bit embarrassed. He is like a cooked duck that can still fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! Not only that, but he must be the first of the Extreme King to have a Kingese run away from them.\u201d\n\nThe princes and the princesses and the guards all exploded. This was the first time they had ever heard of such a thing. They were so hyped, it was as if they had been injected with chicken blood.\n\nHan Sen thought this was bad. \u201cDid the king tree notice that the Original Water King Body isn\u2019t really mine? Is that why the Kingese ran back? If that is the case, many people might become suspicious of my identity. I have suffered some really bad luck here. If I knew this might happen, I would have just settled for collecting some king air and left.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was depressed. As everyone chattered and laughed about what had happened, the top of the king tree lit up.\n\nThe king leaves were suddenly all so bright, and a Kingese fell down like a sun. It came from the top of the tree, flying down to Han Sen\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cCome! Come! Let us not have something bad this time. Come on!\u201d Han Sen begged awkwardly. If this went wrong, everyone would know that there was something wrong with him.\n\nThe Kingese symbol fell down. Han Sen could see it, too. That word was so solid, unbreakable. It was like a stone that had been made a billion years ago. It said, \u201cJi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s gay, why would I have a word like this? No, no, I\u2019m not gay at all\u2026 It must mean gene or base\u2026 It must be\u2026 It must be\u2026\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen honestly didn\u2019t care what the word was, as long as he had a word.\n\nEveryone who watched this was now looking at Han Sen, trying to see what was happening. Some were actually hoping that the Kingese would escape again.\n\nQuickly, the word landed on Han Sen\u2019s head. Everyone held their breath. They stretched their necks to look at Han Sen\u2019s head and the Ji word. They wanted to see if it would actually meld into him.\n\n\u201cCome on! Come down! Don\u2019t make this any worse!\u201d Han Sen was in a rush. He would have liked to just grab the word, cram it into his mouth, and swallow it.\n\nIt was a shame that grabbing Kingese symbols was impossible, though. If they could have, the royal children wouldn\u2019t have had to wait. They would have just grabbed the Kingese by themselves.\n\nHan Sen kept praying in his heart. The word Ji stopped one centimeter in front of Han Sen\u2019s head. It didn\u2019t actually touch down on his body.\n\n\u201cSh*t! It is playing around with me again.\u201d Han Sen wanted to cry.\n\n\u201cIt stopped\u2026 It stopped\u2026\u201d Someone sounded so excited by the sight. They sounded like a kid that had never traveled abroad before and was finally going, with the way they screamed. It was like they were visiting a foreign place.\n\nPrince Sixteen was getting really famous now. He was the first one to ever be abandoned by a Kingese.\n\n\u201cHahaha! This is so funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why do the Kingese refuse to touch down and meld into Brother Sixteen\u2019s body?\u201d\n\nThe whole of King\u2019s Garden exploded. They had never thought something like this might happen, but now they were. Their nosy souls were burning.\n\nBai Qing Xia, who was closest to Han Sen, was also confused. He didn\u2019t know what was going on with Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHuh? That is weird. The Ji word has stopped, but it hasn\u2019t left.\u201d Someone noticed this little issue, too.\n\nThe Ji word had stopped, but it didn\u2019t escape like the water one did. It hung above Han Sen\u2019s head as if it was in suspended animation.\n\n\u201cBrother, what the hell is this? If you are going to come down, then come down! Leave, if that is what you prefer. Why are you just hanging around here? There is no half-in, half-out. Are you just trying to scare me? Whatever it is you want to do, just get it over with.\u201d Han Sen rolled his eyes and stared at the Ji Kingese. He was nervous.\n\nHan Sen thought his luck had turned sour. He thought everything had gone awry. He had drawn too much attention in the Pavilion already. Now that this had happened, it was difficult for him not to appear suspicious.\n\n\u201cI need to be an honest person. I will never disguise myself as someone else again. I cannot deal with this kind of stress.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes were burning. The Kingese wasn\u2019t moving. It didn\u2019t come down, and it didn\u2019t go back. It just hung where it was.\n\nEveryone was confused, but somehow, the top of the king tree became super bright again. Many king leaves lit up like a tapestry of suns.\n\nVoila!\n\nThe suns began to fall like a meteor shower. Many Kingese fell down from the king tree. They were all coming for Han Sen like a galactic stream. It was like the stars were spilling forth in his direction.\n\n\u201cSh*t! What is this?\u201d Seeing all these flying Kingese symbols, Han Sen\u2019s heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest.\n\nAll of the royal children and guards looked on with wide eyes. Everyone was petrified."
