    "text": "Han Sen drew his Ghost Teeth Knife as he felt a chain of water wrap around him. It bound him tightly, and his arms were completely restrained.\n\nThe King class guard didn\u2019t move to attack. He just allowed his AoE to bring Han Sen closer. Han Sen\u2019s limbs were outstretched as he was brought to float before the King guard.\n\n\u201cYou think beating Prince Wuchang makes you a bad*ss? You\u2019re naive. Dukes are still Dukes. The gulf of power between a Duke and King is the same societal difference that separates royalty and slaves. It is the difference between the sky and the ground. It is the difference that separates the stars and the moon,\u201d the King class guard said. He reached for Han Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife. He intended to use Han Sen\u2019s own blade to kill him.\n\nWhen the King class guard reached for Ghost Teeth Knife\u2019s handle, Han Sen cast Jadeskin and Mutant Blood at the same time.\n\nHis flesh became jade, and his crystal blood melted. It was like boiling lava now, surging throughout Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nThe water that restricted Han Sen\u2019s body thinned. It didn\u2019t snap, but it was stretched. It couldn\u2019t stop what Han Sen was doing.\n\n\u201cThe monarchy can be overthrown. The skies and the ground can be reversed. The stars can be moved. Day and night can be swapped. Everything is in my hands.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s voice was as cold as steel. He grabbed Ghost Teeth Knife and swiped it at the King class guard. The Teeth power became a roaring, dark purple demon. It was going to eat the man.\n\n\u201cYou are just a Duke. How do you know how thick the sky is? Do you think the ground can be shaken? How bright are the stars and the moons, do you think?\u201d The King class knight didn\u2019t move. Instead, he threw a punch against Han Sen\u2019s knife air.\n\nThe green punch was like water. The Teeth power\u2019s demon knife air hit the water and created a ripple. It was just a swirl, like a drop of water into the sea, becoming one with the rest.\n\nThe King class guard came punching at Han Sen with the force of a tsunami. Han Sen was like a boat, rocking around on the crazy waves of the tumultuous sea, caught by powers that could overthrow and drown him any second.\n\nDong!\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s left hand hit the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum that was still tied to his waist. That sound was like the toxic stinger of a scorpion, and it was thrusting at the King class guard\u2019s head.\n\nThe guard\u2019s face changed. His green light was still bright and powerful, but it was too late for him to do anything about Han Sen\u2019s attack. The acoustics of the drum went straight into his head.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d the King guard screamed, and his AoE was disrupted.\n\nHan Sen pulled out the Thunder God Spike which was slung around his back. He used the lightning power to needle the King class guard who was still screaming from the drum\u2019s attack.\n\nBut Han Sen could feel that the Thunder God Spike was somewhat restricted. It was like he was trying to move it through the deep sea, and it was forced to slowly part the water as it slid forward. Even bullets would be slowed by that stopping power.\n\n\u201cD*mn it! The AoE is affecting me too much,\u201d Han Sen thought in frustration.\n\nBefore the Thunder God Spike struck the guard\u2019s body, the man clutched his head and retreated. He was able to avoid Han Sen\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cI clearly underestimated you.\u201d The King guard opened his hand, and a lance appeared in its grip. Lots of lance-waves came at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was still restricted by the guard\u2019s area-of-effect. His movement was slowed, and he was unable to dodge. He lifted the Thunder God Spike and tried to use it to repel the King guard\u2019s lance. He also pounded the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum again.\n\nDong!\n\nThe drum was like thunder, and the King guard had to use his power to protect himself. He was able to block the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s attack.\n\nThe Thunder God Spike in Han Sen\u2019s hand collided with the lance. The silver lightning and the green light came against each other, but the lightning wasn\u2019t repelled. It struck the lance.\n\nThere was a loud scream as the King guard was electrified. He almost dropped the lance in his hand, but he wasn\u2019t paralyzed for long, and he soon recovered. Han Sen had wanted to spike him while he was paralyzed, but he couldn\u2019t.\n\nThe King class guard was shocked by Han Sen\u2019s attacks. It was frightening that a Duke, even when he was submerged in a King class area-of-effect, could be so threatening.\n\nHan Sen was worried. The King guard was clearly stronger than Night River King had been. The guard had struck twice, but he hadn\u2019t hit Han Sen yet.\n\nThe King class guard wasn\u2019t looking at Han Sen with disdain. His eyes looked sharp, and his lance was like a dragon that was pointing at Han Sen. He wasn\u2019t willing to let Han Sen touch him with the Thunder God Spike.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was still bound by the AoE, and the guard was now being careful. This was going to be a dirty fight.\n\nThe guard was avoiding the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum and Thunder God Spike. He was wary of exposing himself to either weapon, and that was how Han Sen maintained their impasse.\n\nThe King guard\u2019s lance kept poking around Han Sen\u2019s defenses, but he couldn\u2019t get past Han Sen\u2019s Thunder God Spike. He was shocked by this, and he thought, \u201cThis Duke is still defending himself, despite being dead-center in my AoE attack? This guy really is something special. It is no wonder he was able to defeat Prince Bai Wuchang.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s power kept exploding out of him. He could barely hold off the AoE\u2019s restrictive properties, and doing so was requiring a great deal of energy. And if he ended up exhausting himself, beating his foe would be impossible.\n\nHan Sen found a chance. He jumped up and flapped his wings, intending to teleport out of the King\u2019s area-of-effect.\n\nBut the teleportation capabilities of the wings were too limited. He could only go one mile at a time, which wasn\u2019t nearly enough to separate himself from the King\u2019s area-of-effect. And now the King guard was coming for him.\n\nInside the area-of-effect, Han Sen couldn\u2019t compete with his opponent\u2019s speed.\n\n\u201cHe is a water element King. Being in a high-temperature place will be a disadvantage for him.\u201d Han Sen quickly turned and headed for the enormous lava valley.\n\nPang!\n\nBeneath the restrictions of that King area-of-effect, Han Sen\u2019s movements were slow. The King class guard managed to land a blow on his shoulder, and he felt water thrust into his wound.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and then jumped into the lava.\n\nThe King class guard laughed darkly. \u201cI thought you were worthy of respect. I didn\u2019t expect you to do something so foolish. Water is not a cold element. Do you really think fire will work well against water? I will show you how scary water can be when up against a fire element.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the King guard leaped into the lava without hesitation.\n\nThe King class guard traveled through the lava quickly, and Han Sen couldn\u2019t find a way to escape his area-of-effect. The scariest thing was the way that the water attack was heated up by the lava. The water orb became a region of scalding steam. Its binding powers grew stronger, and it seemed as if it was going to melt Han Sen\u2019s Galactic Lobster Armor."
