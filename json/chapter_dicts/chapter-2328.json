His ice powers didn\u2019t work on her very well, and when Han Sen saw that Cher was about to free herself, he knew that her escaping would result in him being exposed.\n\nBut killing Cher wouldn\u2019t exactly make him appear less suspicious, either.\n\nThis was Night Charm Town. It wasn\u2019t a place where people were murdered for resources like Knight\u2019s Paradise. In this town, people were required to follow the laws established by the Extreme King. Not even a prince could randomly murder someone with proper cause.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes flashed. Cher, who was currently crushed under Han Sen, was overwhelmed with both anger and fear. She had been fully confident that her Fox Eyes would work on Han Sen, so she had been caught completely off guard when he turned the tables on her.\n\nFortunately, her own powers were rather impressive. She was stronger than Bai Yi, and she had a high resistance to ice. She couldn\u2019t be bound easily.\n\nSeeing that Cher was about to escape the ice, Han Sen leaned over next to her ear and whispered, \u201cCher, do you remember Fox Queen?\u201d\n\nWhen Cher heard this, she shivered. Her attempts to struggle away from him suddenly ceased. Soon after, though, she returned to normal, trying to fight her way free as if she hadn\u2019t heard what Han Sen had just asked her.\n\nHan Sen knew which way the wind was blowing, so he let go of Cher and coldly said, \u201cI am very close with Fox Queen; if that claim was untrue, then you know that I would already be a dead man. So, you had better be quiet and talk. If something happens to me, something will happen to Fox Queen, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I believe you?\u201d Cher broke through the last of the ice that caked her body, but she didn\u2019t jump away after she freed herself.\n\nHan Sen brought his mouth close to Cher and spoke the two words quietly. \u201cRed Sleeve.\u201d\n\nCher\u2019s jaw went slack. Clearly, she was aware that Red Sleeve was Fox Queen.\n\nHan Sen now felt much safer. He laid down on Cher and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to invade your personal space, but I\u2019m sure you can understand my situation. Can you tell me how I might manage to get through this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are Han Sen?\u201d Cher wasn\u2019t stupid; not many of the Foxes were. She knew what was really going on, but she just found it hard to believe.\n\nHan Sen was a Duke, and Bai Yi\u2019s Return to Origin had failed. Han Sen had ended up killing Prince Bai Yi, then assumed the man\u2019s identity as a disguise. He was so brave it was almost impossible to fathom.\n\nHan Sen knew that he couldn\u2019t hide his knowledge of Fox Queen, but this was the best result he would be able to achieve, given the current circumstances.\n\nThey both had dirt on each other. Han Sen thought that a Fox wouldn\u2019t sell him out unless they absolutely had to.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Han Sen smiled at Cher.\n\nMany different emotions flickered across Cher\u2019s face. After a while, she gritted her teeth and said, \u201cWait for me on the bed. I am going to call the Pig lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. If I was willing to do that, why would I have exposed myself?\u201d Han Sen crushed Cher to the bed to keep her from moving.\n\nCher blushed and said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go, Bai Ling Shuang will notice. Do not worry; I will use a geno art to control the Pig lady. Put on your clothes and wait for me, just don\u2019t get off the bed. Only the bed isn\u2019t faced with a camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I will take your word on it this one time.\u201d Han Sen rolled over to the other side of the bed, grabbed his clothes, and put on his garments one by one.\n\nCher glanced at Han Sen and walked out.\n\nWhile Han Sen was pulling on his clothes, he receded into thought. When Cher came back, she brought someone who was three meters tall and had a waist that was eight feet wide. It was the Pig.\n\nBut it seemed as if the Pig lady was under a spell. Her eyes looked dull, and she listened to Cher\u2019s every command. She fell down on the bed, and the bed made a chorus of squeaky noises.\n\nCher looked at Han Sen and murmured, \u201cIn order to make this work, I need you to make some noise.\u201d\n\nNot long after, Cher took the Pig woman away. She came back and lay down next to Han Sen wearing only a bathrobe.\n\n\u201cHow did you disguise yourself as Prince Sixteen?\u201d Cher asked as she lay looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t difficult. What about you? You are so young, and you\u2019re surrounded by the elite of the Extreme King. Your life must be hard,\u201d Han Sen said with a broad smile.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you show a little gratitude? I just saved your life. If I hadn\u2019t, you would have had to do it with that Pig\u2026\u201d When she realized what she was saying, Cher blushed and stopped talking.\n\n\u201cOut of all the Foxes that I have met, you are the least shameless. You seem to be very pure, yet you\u2019ve also managed to achieve King class. You must be quite famous among the Foxes,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\nCher raised her red lips in a slight sneer. \u201cAre you trying to get information out of a Fox? You are too naive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are merely making a trade. You think too much.\u201d Han Sen coughed.\n\nHan Sen was very interested in Fox Queen\u2019s conspiracy. If a woman like Fox Queen was willing to disguise herself as a female guard, then something big had to be going down.\n\nHan Sen had intended to glean more information from Cher. She was so pure that she looked rather inexperienced. But she actually seemed smart enough to deprive him of hope.\n\nCher moved her face closer to Han Sen. She was facing him, and she was so near that she almost touched Han Sen\u2019s nose. They could feel each other\u2019s breath.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? I have standards, you know,\u201d Han Sen said with a blink.\n\n\u201cYou really are Han Sen?\u201d Cher asked curiously, still examining him.\n\n\u201cWe are sleeping together, and still you must ask that? I feel rather hurt.\u201d Han Sen lifted his shoulders in a light shrug.\n\nCher\u2019s eyes looked like moons. She smiled and said, \u201cI thought that we Foxes were very good at changing our identities, but you must be even better. You\u2019ve disguised yourself as Extreme King\u2019s Prince Sixteen and successfully avoided detection. Not even Fox Queen would have the courage to do what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learned a few tricks from Fox Queen that made it possible,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nCher\u2019s eyes looked bright. \u201cAre you close with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cClose. Very close. Fox Queen kind of wanted to marry me, but I didn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d Han Sen casually said.\n\nWhen Cher heard that, her eyes widened. She didn\u2019t believe the claim. \u201cLiar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I lie? Your Fox Queen\u2019s butt has a\u2026\u201d Han Sen supplied some helpful descriptive details.\n\nCher looked at Han Sen as if he was a monster. A while later she said, \u201cYou and Fox Queen\u2026 That\u2026 That\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI failed her when I turned down her proposal.\u201d Han Sen sighed. \u201cNow I can only make up for it by trying to help her and assuage her grief. If I can do that, I can die a happy man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to help Fox Queen claim our treasure?\u201d Cher felt touched as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen felt a ripple of relief pass through him; Cher was much easier to deal with than other Foxes. While she was King class and strong, she didn\u2019t have much practical experience."
