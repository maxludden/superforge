He went on ahead with Li Keer and Exquisite.\n\nThe bronze furnace continued to spit out fire behind Han Sen, creating a sentence that read, \u201cDon\u2019t go. There is danger!\u201d\n\nHan Sen asked the bronze furnace what the danger was, but it didn\u2019t elaborate. All it did was continue to warn Han Sen of some danger, and that he should stay away from there.\n\n\u201cYou wait for me here.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think there was any reason that he should be afraid; there were few creatures in the core area that could threaten him these days.\n\nThe three of them kept flying. The bronze furnace was too reluctant to follow them.\n\nAfter a short while of flight, the three of them saw a xenogeneic soaring through space. As soon as they noticed the xenogeneic, the creature noticed them, too. It roared and flew over to them.\n\nThe xenogeneic growled like a crocodile, but it looked to have been built out of red metal. Bat-like metal wings spread from the creature\u2019s back, and it flew very quickly.\n\nLights gleamed across the edges of its metallic body as it cast an area. Metal chains appeared within that area, shooting out and binding anything that moved.\n\nHan Sen and the others were tied down by those metal chains. Han Sen struggled and noticed that the metal chains were so strong, they were too hard for even him to break them.\n\nHan Sen summoned his strength, but suddenly, there was a flash. The creature was cut in half, and the chains that bound them vanished.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d Exquisite said coldly. Then, she flew over to the King xenogeneic and dug out its xenogeneic gene.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite is quite strong,\u201d Han Sen complimented.\n\nThe hit earlier was nothing short of perfection. It happened so fast that Han Sen hadn\u2019t even seen what skill she unleashed to destroy that xenogeneic. Her skills were strong, there was no doubt of that.\n\nBut it made Han Sen curious. It had been a long time since he\u2019d stayed in Sky Palace, but he had never heard of Li Keer or Exquisite in the time he spent there. With their powers, there was no way he could have avoided hearing stories about them.\n\nExquisite, with an absence of emotion, said, \u201cThat was an ordinary space cutting skill.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and said nothing. Space geno arts were difficult to practice. Exquisite made it sound as if the skill was nothing extraordinary, but Han Sen knew she was just acting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just arrived, and already we\u2019ve encountered a King xenogeneic. We are lucky. We should be able to earn a lot from this trip,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cAre the xenogeneics around here the same as that one?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYes. These xenogeneics are called Chain Demon Crocodiles. They rule this area. There are many Marquises and Dukes here. Kings and half-deifieds, also. There is a legendary crocodile god here, as well, but we have never seen it,\u201d Li Keer answered.\n\nHan Sen nodded. Then, the three of them proceeded. There were many Chain Demon Crocodiles in the nearby asteroids. Crocodiles began to emerge from the asteroid belts, and while Han Sen examined the creatures, Exquisite was already moving.\n\nExquisite immediately flew over to the Chain Demon Crocodiles, her white clothes trailing behind her. There were tens of thousands of them, but most of them were low level. Han Sen didn\u2019t see a single King class crocodile in their midst.\n\nJust as Exquisite was about to reach the hordes of demon crocodiles, her body suddenly vanished from sight. The geno art used by Exquisite was familiar to Han Sen. She had teleported.\n\nBut Exquisite\u2019s proficiency with teleportation abilities had already reached Space Teleportation. She was able to cross great distances with the skill. Han Sen was unable to see her amidst the crocodile group.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Han Sen heard a squeal. Then, Exquisite\u2019s body appeared before them again. In her hand, she held a xenogeneic gene that was shaped like a metal cogwheel. It was the same xenogeneic gene that could be found in the King class crocodiles.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. There was only one King there. Killing these lower-level ones is pointless,\u201d Exquisite said. Then, she flew away.\n\nHan Sen watched Exquisite leave. He thought of something, and a smile crossed his face. Then he followed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if Exquisite was deliberately stealing the King xenogeneics, but if this was to continue, Exquisite was going to kill all the Kings. If that happened, this trip would have been a waste of time.\n\n\u201cThe Sky can be so scary. I\u2019ve never heard of Exquisite before, but she is so strong.\u201d Han Sen then got to thinking about how he might steal the demon crocodiles from beneath her nose.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s speed, any crocodiles below King class had no hope of chasing after them. They would be left in the dust.\n\n\u201cThe giant planet up ahead has loads of demon crocodiles. Should we go there?\u201d Li Keer pointed at the planet as she spoke.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen nodded. If there were lots of crocodile Kings, then he wouldn\u2019t have to fight against Exquisite for the kills.\n\n\u201cThis planet is like a white dwarf. Its temperature and gravity are scary, so be careful,\u201d Li Keer warned them.\n\nHan Sen looked at the dark red planet and was shocked. Compared to ordinary stars, white dwarfs were very small.\n\nBut this white dwarf up ahead was very large. It looked like it would take forever for them to fly to it unless they used Space Teleportation. Luckily, though, the core area\u2019s space wasn\u2019t like ordinary space. There wasn\u2019t a lot of space between the planets like there was in the Alliance.\n\nThey entered the orbit of their destination, and Han Sen felt the heat immediately start to burn his body. A powerful force of gravity was pulling him down.\n\n\u201cThis gravity is very strong.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Even with his level of power, he could still feel the effects of that gravity. The mass of that planet was unimaginable.\n\nWhile it was an annoyance, Han Sen could still fly with that amount of gravity. As he dropped toward the planet, he felt like the powerful forces acting on him were slowing down everything around him. Even Break Space Teleportation was really slow now.\n\nQuickly, Han Sen discovered two Chain Demon Crocodiles lying on the planet\u2019s surface. This made Han Sen very happy, because the two Chain Demon Crocodiles were Kings. They had dark red metal armor that looked very intimidating.\n\n\u201cAre the demon crocodiles on this planet King class?\u201d Han Sen thought it was possible. The planet\u2019s temperature and gravity were scary, after all. Ordinary demon crocodiles probably couldn\u2019t survive such conditions.\n\nIf Duke demon crocodiles went to the surface, they probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to move there. The scary gravity would probably crush them, not to mention the insane temperatures that would likely melt their bodies."
