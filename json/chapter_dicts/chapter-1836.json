Gu Qingcheng had become a Noble on her first go, and that saved him a Magnet Fruit\n\n\u201cI will walk around and sign-up near your ship.\u201d Gu Qingcheng then left the abandoned building. She was not scared of the foreign world she had just been brought into. In fact, she was quite curious.\n\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t start up trouble while they\u2019re here.\u201d Han Sen felt rather depressed. Gu Qingcheng was pretty stubborn, and there was nothing he could do to put a leash on it.\n\nThey had a good start, anyway, and nothing bad occurred. Han Sen was confident So, he went back to the sanctuary and brought Xie Qing King on through.\n\nXie Qing King was even faster. After going in, he generated his armor immediately.\n\nA silver liquid oozed out of his body and wrapped him up completely. He generated a set of silver armor.\n\nJust like Gu Qingcheng, Xie Qing King evolved for a second time without hassle or issue. When the geno armor melted and became something else, he was left with a silver book.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of geno armament is that?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide as he looked at Xie Qing King and his silver book.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s head outside for now.\u201d Xie Qing King could not wait to get out of there.\n\n\u201cRemember to get yourself registered at the airship!\u201d Han Sen called out to Xie Qing King\u2019s back as he left.\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Xie Qing King hollered, but he didn\u2019t look back. All he did was raise an okay hand- signal.\n\n\u201cD*mn it! None of them are reliable. I need to find someone amongst them that is.\u201d Han Sen went back to the sanctuary and brought out Little Angel; she was a true heir of his.\n\nBut Han Sen had worried that Little Angel might end up like Golden Growler, and get taken by some entity.\n\nLittle Angel followed Han Sen request and began her process of evolution. Han Sen was focusing more on his surroundings right now, and if there was any movement, he\u2019d throw Little Angel right back into the sanctuary.\n\nLittle Angel had two shapes. One looked like a human lady, and the other would become a blonde-haired, white-winged angel.\n\nAs this was happening, Little Angel shone and became an angel. A holy light emerged from her body, providing her a holy light geno armor.\n\nBefore Han Sen could take a look at the armor, Little Angel was evolving for a second time.\n\nThe holy light armor melted into her.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic.\u201d Han Sen was nervous, seeing this. He was worried there might be an issue with her evolution.\n\nWhen the holy light blended into her body, Little Angel\u2019s body began to glow. Even her bones were giving off light Little Angel\u2019s body was mutating. This situation was mirroring what Han Sen had seen with Golden Growler.\n\nQuickly, Little Angel\u2019s body generated a set of angel armor. Before Han Sen could react, the holy light generated a transparent greatsword.\n\nHan Sen was frozen. Little Angel had indeed become a xenogeneic, but she still had a set of angel armor and an angelic sword.\n\nLittle Angel\u2019s body now looked like that of a valkyrie. And as this occurred, Han Sen suddenly felt something inside his pocket move.\n\nThe deified feather flew out towards Little Angel.\n\nThe feather hovered before Little Angel, and then burst into white light The light drifted down and melted into the sword.\n\nThe transparent greatsword displayed changes after the deified feather combined with it.\n\nThe transparent greatsword started to change. It still looked like a greatsword, but its shape also became feather-like. It was like a white-winged feather sword. Its size was no different than it had been, however.\n\nHan Sen was frozen, but he was very happy. The power she had put her at the zenith of what was achievable by a Baron. She was the cream of the Baron crop, and her sword had absorbed the deified feather. This meant Little Angel could become a deified being, for sure.\n\nHan Sen had saved himself the trouble of trying to refine the feather himself. This was a rare thing.\n\nLittle Angel exited from the xenogeneic mode and returned to the form of a human lady. Seeing this, Han Sen sighed. And he felt incredibly relieved, knowing what had happened to Golden Growler was not going to happen to her. Little Angel did not get consumed by the killing urge, and she remained the same.\n\n\u201cLittle Angel, wait here.\u201d Han Sen wanted to take Little Angel back. Letting her out alone was most certainly unsafe.\n\nBack in the sanctuary, he brought the silver fox through next On such a harsh planet, they\u2019d most certainly need Little Silver\u2019s healing powers.\n\nLittle Silver was the last to come through, but he was the one that had actually eaten the most geno fruits. So, he could generate his geno armor right away.\n\nLittle Silver stood motionless with a very elegant posture. The silver fur rippled and waved with a silver liquid. It blanketed his whole body and made him appear stiff like a statue.\n\nThe silver fox\u2019s evolution stopped here, though. He did not evolve a second time.\n\nLittle Silver looked disappointed in himself, and he walked over to Han Sen for comfort. He rubbed Han Sen\u2019s leg vigorously with his head.\n\nHan Sen crouched, stroked his head, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Being talented is nothing. With me here, no matter what becomes of you, you will be the best in my eyes.\u201d\n\nHan Sen then gave Little Silver the juice of a Magnet Fruit. Little Silver\u2019s geno armor showed some form of movement His silver fur began to melt and move around his body.\n\n\u201cIs he turning into a xenogeneic, as well?\u201d Han Sen felt rather nervous. The silver fox was not Little Angel, so he didn\u2019t know if Little Silver would remain his former self.\n\nThe silver light blended into Little Silver\u2019s eyes, turning them into a pool of silver. Lightning flashed and flickered through them.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He thought Little Silver\u2019s evolution would occur around the tail, and he didn\u2019t expect it to be his eyes.\n\nThe eyes grew brighter with a silver light The light dissipated after a while, but his pupils remained silver. When you looked closely, you could see the presence of a silver light within them.\n\nHan Sen had only planned on bringing the four of them to Planet Eclipse, but Zero also said she wanted to go. So, he brought her along with him, too.\n\nZero had done a lot for Han Sen\u2019s family, and she never complained or asked for anything, so Han Sen could not reject her request\n\nZero didn\u2019t say much, and when she arrived in the geno universe, she went to generate a geno armor. But before she could start, something happened."
