The ships landed amidst an enormous field of stones, and the passengers of the ships made camp nearby.\n\nOn Miss Mirror\u2019s orders, the Spring Rain members began digging into the stone field, unearthing even more rocks.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t instruct Han Sen to do anything, other than telling him to stay in camp. While he didn\u2019t have to do any digging, his ability to wander around as he wished was limited.\n\nHan Sen asked Miss Mirror what sort of place they had come to and what their mission was there, but she didn\u2019t answer him. She just told him that he would be safe as long as he stayed close, and he would be called for when the time came for him to work.\n\n\u201cThis is the xenogeneic space Ning Yue described. Ning Yue\u2019s little green sword came from one of the rocks that was found here. It looks like Miss Mirror\u2019s task here is the same as it was for the Hell. They want to excavate something out of all this stone,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He really wanted to join the others in the stone field, so he could examine the rocks.\n\nBut Miss Mirror was very firm that he shouldn\u2019t leave camp, so joining the others was out of the question.\n\nInstead, Han Sen spent his time studying his geno arts and absorbing King class xenogeneic genes.\n\nOn their second day in the xenogeneic space, something occurred in the stone fields. A few Spring Rain members had to be carried back to camp. When Han Sen heard the commotion and came over to see, he found that the unfortunate individuals were turning into stone. Not long after, their entire bodies were fully petrified. They were just a bunch of statues.\n\nMiss Mirror and the two deified elites tried to stop the petrification process, but they could do nothing. None of their attempts even seemed to slow the transformation.\n\nAfter this, the work in the stone fields was brought to a halt. Although they were no longer digging, Miss Mirror showed no sign of wanting to leave.\n\nMore ships arrived a few days later, bringing many different creatures to the camp. They were from a variety of different races, and all of them were Marquises or Dukes. They must have been brought there to become workers in the stone field.\n\n\u201cNing Yue.\u201d As Han Sen watched the workers line up to register, he saw a pretty woman with pink armor. He recognized her as Ning Yue, and he felt his eyes widen.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Not because Ning Yue was now a woman; Han Sen knew that little factoid already.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t strange that Ning Yue was actually there, either. Ning Yue would have been looking for a chance to come back, so he could find out what happened to his body. The Extreme King had recruited workers, so it was reasonable that Ning Yue had joined their ranks.\n\nHan Sen was simply surprised by what he wore. He had a little pink dress on, and he also had some pink earrings, rings, necklaces, and red flowers in his hair. He was like a pink lady, and he was genuinely pretty. If Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen Ning Yue before, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize him.\n\n\u201cOh no! What is wrong with Ning Yue? Even if his body turned into the body of a woman, it doesn\u2019t mean he has to dress up as one,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. The longer he watched Ning Yue, the more convinced he became that something was deeply wrong.\n\n\u201cHow to talk to Ning Yue alone?\u201d Han Sen wanted to ask him what had happened, but he wasn\u2019t permitted to talk to the workers. Even if he could, everyone would be watching. There was nowhere they could discuss matters privately.\n\nHan Sen thought about it overnight. And the next day, he barged into Miss Mirror\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror! Miss Mirror! You brought me here, and yet you aren\u2019t letting me do anything. You won\u2019t let me out, and you won\u2019t even let me go on the internet. What is this?\u201d Han Sen demanded.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, we couldn\u2019t stop the prince! He just barged in,\u201d the guards said tensely, trying to explain his sudden intrusion.\n\n\u201cYou guys can leave,\u201d Miss Mirror said in a cool voice. Her pretty eyes didn\u2019t even glance their way. Instead, she kept her focus fixed on the documents she was reading.\n\nAfter the guards closed the door, Han Sen said, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to let me out, at least allow me to do something. If I\u2019m stuck at home all day again, I am going to go crazy. And Bao\u2019er is just a kid. She can\u2019t remain cooped up all day, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the one who asked to bring her here. She is entirely your responsibility.\u201d Miss Mirror closed the file and looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou will be given your task when the time comes. But for now, your job is just to wait patiently in camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. I can do that, but can you at least make nicer food? Plus, I want Bao\u2019er to have a maid to look after her. That isn\u2019t too much to ask, is it?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWe are here to work. We aren\u2019t here on vacation.\u201d After a brief pause, Miss Mirror said, \u201cI will find you a maid. Now go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Find a pretty one, though. It annoys me if the maid is ugly,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cAre you looking for a maid, or are you looking for a woman?\u201d Miss Mirror asked sternly.\n\n\u201cI am Prince Sixteen. Is there something wrong with having a woman to please me?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cPrince Sixteen?\u201d Miss Mirror shot Han Sen a flat look.\n\nHan Sen coughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do anything. I just want someone to look after my kid. But you won\u2019t let me go out, and I must make myself look like more of a prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other concerns you would like to share?\u201d Miss Mirror asked, fixing Han Sen with another unnerving stare.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cIf there is nothing more you require, then go home. I have work to attend to,\u201d Miss Mirror said in clear dismissal.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now. Please be considerate when picking a maid for me,\u201d Han Sen said. Miss Mirror stared at him until he left the office.\n\n\u201cI wonder if Miss Mirror will just pick a worker? If she picks a worker, I think Ning Yue will have a high chance of being selected,\u201d Han Sen thought as he walked. It was all he could do, after all.\n\nIf Miss Mirror didn\u2019t pick a worker, then Han Sen would have to find another way to get some alone time with his target.\n\nThe next day, after Han Sen opened the door to take Bao\u2019er to the canteen to eat, he saw a pretty Extreme King woman standing directly before him.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, Miss Mirror asked me to serve you.\u201d The woman bowed to Han Sen, but her face was expressionless.\n\n\u201cNot bad! What\u2019s your name?\u201d Han Sen smiled at the woman.\n\nHe had been prepared for this possibility, so he wasn\u2019t disappointed. If Miss Mirror had picked any random person, Han Sen would have grown suspicious.\n\n\u201cFalling Leaf,\u201d the woman answered.\n\n\u201cFalling Leaf, huh? Not bad. Not bad. Miss Mirror didn\u2019t disappoint me. Come. Let\u2019s go find something to eat.\u201d Han Sen squinted slightly, lifting a smiling Bao\u2019er up to sit on his shoulder. Then the trio made their way to the canteen.\n\nWhile they ate, Han Sen turned to Bao\u2019er\u2019s new maid. \u201cFalling Leaf, your mission is to take care of Bao\u2019er. Satisfy all her desires. You cannot make her cry. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Falling Leaf answered, her voice smooth and emotionless."
