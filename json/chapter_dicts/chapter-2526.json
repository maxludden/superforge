    "text": "When he fought with his Gold Robot General, Han Sen was like a wolf entering a sheep pen. Wherever his swordlights went, his enemies fell to pieces. Those King class Steel Armors couldn\u2019t withstand the weakest of his strikes.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Steel Armor. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Steel Armor beast soul.\u201d\n\nAfter killing one hundred Steel Armors, Han Sen finally earned a beast soul.\n\nThe steel castle appeared to be tired now, though. Its speed had slowed, and not as many Steel Armors were coming out of its doors. It looked like a gasping beast after a long run.\n\nThere were fewer than two hundred Steel Armors, all-in-all. Before today, Han Sen would have had a hard time tracking down and eliminating that many. But the Gold Robot General went through them like a hot knife through butter. He mopped up the last of them in moments.\n\nWhen Han Sen turned to go after the steel castle, the space around it vibrated, trembling like it was being shaken by some cosmic earthquake. A crack in space opened behind the weird steel castle, and the monster entered the space crack and disappeared.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. The bronze furnace was happily munching on the bodies of the Steel Armors, placing them in its forge-like belly.\n\nBut because the furnace was small, after eating eight of the Steel Armors, it couldn\u2019t consume any more.\n\n\u201cWhere is the deified xenogeneic you were talking about?\u201d Han Sen asked the bronze furnace.\n\nThe bronze furnace whistled like a steam engine and spat out more fire. The fire became words, and they said, \u201cDidn\u2019t it just run away?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat steel castle was a deified xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen mumbled in surprise. And then he asked, \u201cCan I still find it?\u201d\n\nHe had wanted to see what else might be able to come out of the steel castle, which was why he hadn\u2019t tried to enter it. But now that it had run off, Han Sen was starting to regret his approach.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t find it,\u201d the bronze furnace said by spitting out words.\n\nHan Sen shrugged his shoulders. He turned around and rummaged through the broken Steel Armors for their xenogeneic genes. There was a steel cogwheel in each of their hearts. Those were their xenogeneic genes.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t going to swallow their entire bodies like the smithy furnace. He dug out the core xenogeneic genes and placed them inside Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nHan Sen put away the Gold Robot General beast soul. He didn\u2019t need it any longer.\n\nHan Sen was still collecting his core xenogeneic genes when he saw someone approach. He raised his head. It was that yellow-clothed woman again.\n\nLi Keer had followed the trail left behind by the bronze furnace\u2019s presence. She had been quite shocked to find that her Very High Sense couldn\u2019t pick up Han Sen\u2019s trail. Her only hope of finding him was to follow the leftover presence of the bronze furnace.\n\nAs soon as Han Sen came into view, Li Keer also saw the Steel Armors scattered all across that zone of space. She paused for a moment to stare at the sight, dumbfounded.\n\nShe recognized those Steel Armors for what they were. She knew that the Steel Armors came from a steel castle that was a core deified xenogeneic. She could only see the bodies of the Steel Armors, though. She didn\u2019t see the steel castle anywhere. The steel castle, she surmised, had probably run away from Han Sen.\n\nThat realization was stunning.\n\nDuring the fight with the Gold Armor General, Han Sen\u2019s main attack had come from Dragon One\u2019s deified treasure, the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger. Li Keer understood that.\n\nAt that point, Li Keer had doubted Han Sen\u2019s attack power. But now, Han Sen had chased the steel castle away all alone. She was no longer hesitant to believe in his capabilities.\n\n\u201cA King can battle deifieds? Although the core area\u2019s deified xenogeneics are weak\u2014akin to fake deifieds\u2014the results Dollar is achieving are still nearly unbelievable. Plus, he can somehow slip under my Very High Sense. Where does this human Dollar come from? Even the Extreme King haven\u2019t had someone this talented in the last thousand years,\u201d Li Keer thought to herself. Without hesitation, she went right up to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cLady Clothes, how much of a coincidence it is for you to show up here.\u201d Han Sen greeted her grudgingly, but he still acknowledged her as she drew near.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence. I have come looking for you,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cYou were looking for me? You aren\u2019t asking me to kill the bronze core tripod again, are you?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He wasn\u2019t interested in doing that, and if Li Keer didn\u2019t uphold her end of their bargain, he was just going to ignore her.\n\nLi Keer shook her head. \u201cI saw the words you left on my back. I saw them, and I\u2019m here to admit that I lost. I really did lose to you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He hadn\u2019t expected Li Keer\u2019s attitude to change so much. She suddenly wasn\u2019t so annoying to talk to.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say such things, my lady,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get to know each other a little better? Let\u2019s try this again. My name is Li Keer.\u201d Li Keer held out her hand and smiled.\n\n\u201cDollar.\u201d Han Sen shook her hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a little about you. If it is possible, I\u2019m interested in hiring you to kill the bronze tripod with me.\u201d After Li Keer lowered her hand, she smiled again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must disappoint you. I have something important that needs doing.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if Li Keer was nice or not; Han Sen had no interest in traveling with her. His plan to kill deified xenogeneics took precedence.\n\nLi Keer wasn\u2019t disappointed, though. She gently said, \u201cDon\u2019t say no just yet. How about hearing what I can offer you first?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought she would offer up a xenogeneic gene or something. It couldn\u2019t be anything spectacular, but since she was being polite and she wasn\u2019t an enemy, Han Sen was willing to let her say her piece.\n\nLi Keer rolled her eyes. She moved forward to stand atop the bodies of the Steel Armors. \u201cIf I\u2019m understanding this situation correctly, you have just slain a horde of Steel Armors and made the steel castle run away, yes?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Li Keer. He didn\u2019t confirm or deny her summary. His silence was an affirmation on its own, though.\n\nLi Keer\u2019s eyes brightened. She had already guessed what had happened, but now her conjecture had received confirmation. She was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\u201cThe steel castle of the core area isn\u2019t very strong for a deified, but you have managed to chase it off as a King class. Not many people in this universe could do such a thing. Dollar\u2019s name surely carries weight,\u201d Li Keer said, gushing his praises.\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He felt annoyed.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a kid who had never seen the world. He wasn\u2019t going to get cocky just because this woman was complimenting him. From what he could tell, Li Keer\u2019s praise was just wasting his time.\n\n\u201cYou have the power to kill core deified xenogeneics, but actually taking them down isn\u2019t as simple as beating them in a fight. Most deified xenogeneics won\u2019t remain in one place for you to deliver the final blow. Like the steel castle, they can be hard to find once they decide to flee. But I can find them. If you help me hunt a core bronze tripod, I can help you locate the deified xenogeneics you seek,\u201d Li Keer said with a wink."
