    "text": "\u201cAh, so opening the king body can attract the Kingese. I thought this was something special,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nAs he mulled this over, one leaf suddenly stood out among the galaxy of shining Kingese. The Kingese upon it was shining brighter than the sun.\n\nBefore Han Sen had even started focusing, the Kingese left the leaf and went straight for Bai Qing Xia.\n\nAmong the people that were watching the sight from afar, someone started screaming in excitement. \u201cIt moved! The Kingese moved! What is that word?\u201d\n\nMany of the royal children looked over to see what the voice was talking about. The Kingese that was shining like a sun seemed to be transparent and natural in its form. It was like looking at a beautifully polished piece of jade.\n\n\u201cFan!\u201d Bai Ling Shuang read the word out loud.\n\n\u201cFan, or pretty gem\u2026 Even the king tree things Prince Seventeen is pretty like a gem. He is a shiny thing himself, and so that is why Fan came down for him,\u201d Bang Canglang said coolly.\n\nThe word Fan was shining, and it landed on Bai Qing Xia\u2019s forehead. It melted into his flesh like a snowflake touching water.\n\nWhen that Kingese symbol blended into the man, Bai Qing Xia\u2019s attractive body looked even shinier. His skin was like the spotless surface of a beautiful jade. Any pale spots on his body seemed to have vanished, and he looked to have been rejuvenated. He looked very handsome.\n\nMany of the princesses were so jealous that it drove them a little crazy. They wanted the word Fan, too. They would rather have that than any of the other Kingese.\n\n\u201cHmph, he is just a pretty boy,\u201d Prince Nineteen scoffed. His eyes were betraying his true feelings, however.\n\n\u201cHe is so pretty. He has everything.\u201d A female guard sighed at the sight. She couldn\u2019t peel her eyes away from Bai Qing Xia\u2019s face.\n\nWhen Fan was totally blended into Bai Qing Xia\u2019s body, another king leaf erupted with a bountiful light. The second symbol flew down, headed for Bai Qing Xia\u2019s forehead once more.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Kingese. The Kingese was shining, but it wasn\u2019t very bright. It was very small, and it would likely bring comfort and calm to those trapped in a storm.\n\n\u201cYin!\u201d Han Sen had never seen the symbol before, but he could read and understand what it meant.\n\nBai Qing Xia saw the Yin drifting into his body. His jade-like light vanished. He looked like someone from heaven that had fallen down to earth to become nothing more than a commoner.\n\nLooking at him more closely would lead to a very different conclusion, however. It was like there was jade hidden among piles of sand. There was a light, just waiting to emerge.\n\nWhen it was truly unearthed, he would look so pretty.\n\n\u201cYin is fitting for him. Bai Qing Xia remained hidden for many years, and then, he started to impress people today. He deserves to have the word Yin.\u201d Bai Ling Shuang sighed. \u201cIt looks like we have another to compete against.\u201d\n\nAs the hidden word settled, another Kingese symbol fell from a king leaf. The next word was like fire, and it moved fiercely along its path. It seemed like it could ignore everything in the world.\n\n\u201cAo.\u201d Han Sen read the word out.\n\nPrince Nineteen grated out a laugh. \u201cSick Beauty was hidden for many years. Even when people humiliated him and made fun of him, he never said a word. He has always been little more than a turtle. Does he really deserve the word Ao? I\u2019m beginning to doubt the tree\u2019s infallible ability to sense the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAo doesn\u2019t mean crazy. Crazy is something on the surface, whereas Ao resides in the bones. This Ao is in the bone and the heart. Bai Qing Xia has been humiliated a lot over the years, but he never gave up his desire to win. He has kept going and going up until now, so he definitely deserves Ao,\u201d Bai Canglang said, shaking his head.\n\nPrince Nineteen snorted. \u201cFan, Yin, and Ao. That isn\u2019t bad. But that combination has no connection to the qualities of a king. It is nothing like Tian, De, Jun, Qin, or Shi. And it most certainly cannot compare with Ren, Yi, Li, Xin, Zhi, Zhong, Xiao Ti. Those three words aren\u2019t very useful, and I highly doubt Father will approve of them.\u201d\n\nBai Canglang looked at Prince Nineteen, but he didn\u2019t say anything in response. His face showed his silent disagreement.\n\nThe Ao landed atop Bai Qing Xia\u2019s head, and it combined with his body. It changed his body, giving him more of that overbearing power.\n\nHan Sen looked at him with much interest, and he thought to himself, \u201cThese Kingese symbols are quite powerful. They can change your genes and alter your body and senses. They can even affect your will. That\u2019s really quite amazing. If I can get a symbol associated with fire, my proficiency with the elements of fire will be much improved. Every word would certainly be useful, and the more words the better.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s next thought made him rather depressed, however. The words the king tree dropped were dependent on the king body that would receive them. Han Sen had stolen Bai Yi\u2019s Original Water King Body. If he used that body to gain Kingese, he would probably get the element of water. And Han Sen wasn\u2019t really interested in water. He was hoping to get Fan, or at least some word that would make him look more handsome.\n\nBut the king tree dropped what it wanted to drop. It always depended on how the king tree felt. People could do nothing to change it.\n\nAfter Ao, another symbol fell down. That word was full of hatred, which Han Sen could tell before he even saw it properly. Merely feeling the hate surrounding it was enough to know that it would bear the word Hen.\n\nSeeing this word, the royal children looked quite interested.\n\n\u201cIntriguing. Bai Qing Xia has hatred in his heart. Who does he hate, I wonder? Does he hate the lack of fairness or the people that used to bully him, perhaps? Or the high-class people above him?\u201d Miss Mirror saw Hen, and she smiled. She looked very interested in that.\n\nAfter the hatred of Hen, another word started to descend. It was called Shan. That was surprising. No matter what strength Bai Qing Xia was hiding, he didn\u2019t sound anything like a strong mountain.\n\nThe Kingese symbols continued to fall, and there had been eight words already. The king tree still hadn\u2019t stopped. More Kingese came down, falling through the leaves.\n\n\u201cThis is the ninth word. This Bai Qing Xia is on the verge of shocking everyone.\u201d All the princes and princesses looked on with wide eyes. No matter what that ninth word would be, it proved that Bai Qing Xia was talented.\n\nIf the ninth word was just some horrible Kingese, then it proved he was an evil individual. He couldn\u2019t be a leader if that was the case.\n\nAfter the ninth word combined with Bai Qing Xia, another king leaf lit up like a sun.\n\n\u201cThe tenth word\u2026 There have been ten words!\u201d Everyone was shocked. Gaining the king tree\u2019s approval nine times was already a glorious thing, but now, Bai Qing Xia was on the verge of getting ten words. This was extremely rare to see in the Extreme King. Everyone looked at Bai Qing Xia differently now."
