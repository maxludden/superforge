He himself had heard a woman crying once before, but then Moon Shadow God appeared. Han Sen believed it to be Moon Shadow God\u2019s voice.\n\nNow, with Yang Yun Sheng having heard the crying sound too, it was weird.\n\nYang Yun Sheng said, \u201cYou will probably laugh when I tell you this, but at the time I was trapped there and feeling hopeless, hearing the crying sound actually made me incredibly angry. I thought I was going to die anyway, but if I was going to be trapped and die, I preferred dying quickly. So, I ran toward the crying sound. I was going to fight that thing in the dark without caring about whether I lived or died.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so strange. I thought I was going to be killed in the dark. I chased the crying noises with the dark power still around me, but it was not as strong as before. My power was able to withstand the oppression of the dark. As I went, I stumbled across here and one long, bright lantern. When I arrived here, the sound of the woman crying was gone.\u201d Yang Yun Sheng tried to explain what had happened to him.\n\n\u201cWas Yang Yun Sheng following Moon Shadow God to get here? No way. Moon Shadow God was above the crack. If Yang Yun Sheng had chased Moon Shadow God, he would be above the crack as well. He also would have reached here a long time ago. He wouldn\u2019t have just arrived now.\u201d Han Sen looked at Yang Yun Sheng and asked, \u201cWhen was the last time you heard the woman cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot long ago,\u201d Yang Yun Sheng replied.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThat cannot be right. It seems like the woman crying wasn\u2019t Moon Shadow God.\u201d\n\nWhile they were talking, the sound of a woman crying was suddenly heard again outside the holy garden. It sounded as if it was there, but it wasn\u2019t there. It sounded very depressed. The sobbing almost made one\u2019s head itch.\n\n\u201cHere it comes again,\u201d Yang Yun Sheng said. \u201cIt\u2019s that sound!\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked outside the holy garden. The two long, bright lanterns outside the door were not very illuminated. Outside the garden was pretty much just darkness. One was not able to see anything.\n\nEveryone held their breaths for a while. Eventually, the crying sound disappeared. It was like the crying person had walked away.\n\nYang Yun Sheng pointed at the meat in the stone pot and said. \u201cDid you guys make this meat? Can I have some? I do not want to starve to death.\u201d That place was quite scary, so he felt as if he could die any second. Therefore, he did not mind eating something.\n\n\u201cThe meat is mine!\u201d Bao\u2019er jumped in front of the stone table and used her hands to protect the stone pot.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but he heard someone else coming from outside the holy garden. Someone else had arrived.\n\nThey saw an old man wearing a gold robe walk into the holy garden. It was Nine Thousand King.\n\n\u201cThis is the holy garden. You outsiders cannot just enter here!\u201d Nine Thousand King looked at Han Sen and the others. He looked angry. He was checking out Han Sen and the others as if to discover something.\n\nYang Yun Sheng looked fairly worried. They had just come to a place that was a bit safer and not life-threatening, yet it was where they again met Nine Thousand King.\n\nYang Yun Sheng knew Nine Thousand King was not as nice as Han Sen.\n\nNine Thousand King quickly looked at the stone pot and Wan\u2019er\u2019s statue inside the pavilion. He looked excited, but it was just for one moment. It could not escape Han Sen\u2019s eye though.\n\n\u201cAre you not going to walk away? Do you want to die?\u201d Nine Thousand King stared at Han Sen and walked closer to the pavilion. His body had dark gold markings on it. He looked strange. It was as if many weird centipedes were surrounding him.\n\nHan Sen did not speak. He stood in front of the pavilion and did not do anything.\n\nYang Yun Sheng was scared. Although he was a butterfly deified elite, Nine Thousand King was an old monster who hailed from Sacred\u2019s era. One was not able to tell how much he had evolved in all that time. He could have been one of the top true gods in existence. No matter, he was not able to beat him.\n\nSeeing Nine Thousand King approaching, Yang Yun Sheng appeared as if he was facing off a big enemy. Nine Thousand King did not even look at him. He looked at Han Sen, showing no care for him.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s body was becoming stronger. From what Yang Yun Sheng saw, it was like a giant monster that could break the sky and could not be beaten. He thought Nine Thousand King was going to perform a strong attack on Han Sen.\n\nInstead, Nine Thousand King walked right before the pavilion without making an attack. He used his power to suppress Han Sen and the others. He said, \u201cI am afraid to damage the leader\u2019s legacy. Do not make me break anything.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er laughed out loud and said, \u201cYou are just afraid of my father hurting you. You make it sound so nice.\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s face did not move. He coldly laughed and said, \u201cI have traveled across the universe following Sacred Leader and slaughtering countless true gods. Your ancestors, at the time, were probably drinking milk from nowhere. Killing you guys will be easy. I just want to earn some karma by letting you go. Do not misunderstand.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled at Nine Thousand King, but he did not speak.\n\nBao\u2019er ignored Nine Thousand King too. She used her spoon to pick up more meat from the stone pot.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s expression changed. He madly shouted and rushed toward the stone pavilion. He reached his hands out at Bao\u2019er. The air on his body turned into the aura of a dark gold centipede. He was coming for her.\n\nHan Sen jumped before the pavilion, clutching the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. He activated Medusa\u2019s Gaze. A weird light shone against the dark gold centipede air. It trapped them all in the air.\n\n\u201cFreezing skills are strong, but to me, the king, they are trifling tricks and nothing more.\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s eyes looked cold as he drew a blade from his waist.\n\nThe sword looked extremely weird. Han Sen had seen many rare swords before, but he had never seen a sword this weird.\n\nThe sword was two fingers wide and four feet long. It looked to have been crafted from blood jade. The weirdest thing was that the sword had eyes. From the tip to the handle, there were some weird eyes all across it. Some of them were open. Some of them were shut. Some of them were half-open. They all looked different from each other. They all lined up and looked extremely weird and disgusting. They made people feel very uncomfortable. It gave people goosebumps.\n\nNine Thousand King said, \u201cNine eyes go through a thousand ancients. One sword slashes the underworld. Under my nine-eyed sword, nothing can survive. I, the king, believe in good morals. I was going to let you guys go, but if you guys want to die, then it is not my fault.\u201d He then raised the nine-eyed sword."
