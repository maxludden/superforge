All the race lanterns were becoming bright and dark like they were going to be put out by a raging storm.\n\nWhen the geno hall fell, all the god temples were shaken away by the god light. It seemed as if the god temples and universe were dead. Aside from hopeless cries, there were no other sounds.\n\nEven the sky full of God Spirits went silent. There were only the sounds of breaking.\n\n\u201cSuch a disaster. I wonder how many creatures in the universe can survive all this.\u201d Sky Palace Leader\u2019s face was cold like ice. There were even all sorts of disasters in Sky Palace.\n\nThe White Jade Jing Tower and Jade City were revealed. A holy air came out from there. The holy air of the White Jade Jing was headed for Sky Palace. It made the people of Sky Palace cry. If there had been no elites and the support of the holy gourd vine, Sky Palace would have been broken by the holy air.\n\nOuter Sky was not faring any better. The ground cracked. Loads of holy air pillars came out like volcanic eruptions, making the ground leak. Xenogeneics were running around like mad. All law and order was broken.\n\nSky Palace and Outer Sky were like that too. Other xenogeneic spaces and normal planets were like that as well.\n\n\u201cThe universe is going to end.\u201d A hopeless fear was in every creature\u2019s heart. No one knew if they would survive this disaster.\n\nWah! Wah! In a stream, a Kate baby was floating. There was a sad crying sound. In the flood\u2019s roaring, it sounded quiet.\n\nIn a volcanic eruption, many cities and villages were destroyed. Some planets were even hit by asteroids and blew up.\n\n\u201cOpen it for me!\u201d Qin Xiu\u2019s eyes looked very passionate. With blood flame suppression, he crushed the geno hall\u2019s door. Shattered rocks were strewn everywhere.\n\nGod\u2019s body was crushed. He slipped into the geno hall. He stopped before the 10,000 lanterns. Behind him, many of the race lanterns were out.\n\nWhen each race lantern was put out, one of the high races was heavily damaged. It made the races that were already suffering disasters fare even worse.\n\nGod looked at Qin Xiu and said, \u201cOne person is making a billion races extinct. Is this really worth it?\u201d\n\nQin Xiu coldly said, \u201cWhen I was in my most hopeless time, there was only one person next to me. To me, this world only consists of this one person. There are billions of creatures, but they mean nothing to me. I do not need to care about them.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Qin Xiu kept pushing forward to suppress the geno hall. Each step Qin Xiu took resulted in God taking one step back. He was going to strike the 10,000 race lanterns behind him.\n\nAll the races knew that if the race lanterns were snuffed out, the geno hall would be done for. But no one was able to stop Qin Xiu. Even the strongest god could not prohibit Qin Xiu\u2019s march on the geno hall.\n\nQin Xiu wanted to walk forward even more. He wanted to destroy the geno hall, but he suddenly stopped. His gaze was frozen. He turned around and looked into space.\n\nThe hearts of the many hopeless races jumped. They did not know what happened. Why would Qin Xiu stop walking? It made them have a slight glimmer of hope.\n\n\u201cAt this time, what in the universe could make Qin Xiu care?\u201d Many elites were feeling both confused and nervous.\n\nMost of the high races were already there. Under the suppression of Qin Xiu, even a true god elite had dropped out of deified class. No creatures were able to combat Qin Xiu.\n\nThey were hoping and praying for a miracle to strike, but they knew the chance of a miracle was far too small.\n\nThey still looked in the direction Qin Xiu was looking. They were hoping for something, but they did not spy any strong presence from that direction.\n\nQin Xiu looked in that direction and said to himself, \u201cWhat is going on? Is this just my imagination? Why do I feel restless?\u201d He was feeling a strong sense of nervousness.\n\nSuddenly, the elites saw a white shadow slowly appear from that direction. It was not fast or have a powerful presence. It was like a morning sun rising into the sky. It walked into the geno hall\u2019s area.\n\nSky Palace Leader\u2019s eyes were the strongest. He saw the white shadow clearly, so he screamed aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s Han Sen! He is still alive!\u201d\n\nMany elites saw it clearly thereafter. It was Han Sen who had walked into the geno hall\n\narea.\n\nHan Sen was different from how he had been before. His body did not have the red fire. His body had a white color and was half-transparent. He did not look like a creature from the universe. He looked like a God Spirit.\n\nQin Xiu saw Han Sen step forward. His expression immediately changed. He stared at Han Sen as if he had seen something unbelievable.\n\n\u201cImpossible. The testing of super genes was not successful. How could a power like this exist\u2026 It cannot be the perfect super gene\u2026 It should have flaws like Wan\u2019er does.\u201d Qin Xiu was talking to himself.\n\nHan Sen stopped a short distance away. His Super God Spirit mode was still affected by Wan\u2019er\u2019s proximity. Han Sen looked at Qin Xiu and said, \u201cQin Xiu, leave Littleflower\u2019s body. This is your last chance.\u201d\n\nQin Xiu coldly said, \u201cI clearly underestimated you if your genes were able to evolve to this level. Even if you are so close to the super gene, you are still useless. Failure is failure. In front of Wan\u2019er, who is even closer to super gene, your power will be suppressed.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Han Sen coldly asked. The Story of Genes was running in his body. When The Story of Genes ran, Han Sen\u2019s body was in xenogeneic mode.\n\nXenogeneic mode and Super God Spirit mode were activated on Han Sen\u2019s body. It made his presence appear a bit strange. \u201cDollar\u2026 Han Sen is Dollar\u2026\u201d All the creatures of the universe were suddenly frozen. They thought it was weird for Han Sen to be using Super God Spirit body. Now, he had a xenogeneic battle body. It was clear to them now. Anyone was able to tell that Han Sen and Dollar were the same person. \u201cHan Sen and Dollar are the same person,\u201d Yisha said. She looked very conflicted. She could not believe it. Her eyes opened wide. She thought about the past and looked even more complicated. Her face turned green, and her face turned white and red. She did not know how to think or feel.\n\nOn Empty Mountain, the green-haired growler\u2019s mouth opened wide. He did not close it. Now, he understood why Golden Growler gave Dollar first place and adhered to what he told it.\n\n\u201cOh, my God! Godfather Han and Dollar are the same person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 This is unbelievable\u2026\u201d\n\nAt the end of the world, many creatures were frozen. They could not believe their eyes.\n\n\u201cThis guy. He has finally exposed himself.\u201d Wang Yuhang shrugged with his shoulders. He knew this would happen.\n\nThe people in Space Garden were not so surprised. Han Sen never told them anything, but most of them had figured it out."
