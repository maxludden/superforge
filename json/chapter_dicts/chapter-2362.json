    "text": "The rainbow sea conch kept running, but the fire across its shell couldn\u2019t be extinguished. It was like a flaming wheel blazing a trail through the water and across the sand. The fire refused to go out.\n\n\u201cThe little red bird, the harbinger of death!\u201d Han Sen was grinning like an idiot. Although he knew the little red bird had become a deified elite, being able to damage another deified elite like that was remarkably impressive.\n\nPlus, the little red bird had only recently become deified, so it could probably improve even more in the future. In time, it might grow up to become something like the Ancient Water God.\n\nThe little red bird cawed in pride. It flew to the rainbow sea conch, and Han Sen followed it while shouting, \u201cSave his last breath for me. I want to take the last hit!\u201d\n\nHan Sen chased after it, and the rainbow sea conch eventually found itself unable to move any farther. The meat inside its shell was boiling. The shell had turned translucent white, and it looked as if the creature was being barbecued.\n\n\u201cIs it still breathing?\u201d Han Sen drew his Thunder God Spike and ran at the fiend. It was a deified xenogeneic, and although Han Sen\u2019s chances of getting a beast soul out of it were low, he still wanted to try.\n\nThe fire around the little red bird\u2019s body vanished, and it floated down to land on Han Sen. It opened its mouth toward the rainbow sea conch and inhaled. The gold fire was pulled back into its belly.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Thunder God Spike slammed into the cooked conch meat, but it was like a blade hitting rubber. The spike would not go in.\n\nHan Sen gathered up all the power he could, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t penetrate the flesh.\n\nAs the rainbow sea conch\u2019s life faded, its body crystallized. It became more and more resistant to Han Sen\u2019s strikes.\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. The prize was right there in front of him, but he couldn\u2019t take it.\n\nNot long after, the rainbow sea conch was completely crystallized. Every inch of its body was a xenogeneic gene. It was like a piece of art made from rainbow crystal.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d The rainbow sea conch was very dead. Han Sen was unable to break its flesh, even though he used his Thunder God Spike to strike it.\n\n\u201cElectrocution is a type of damage, right? Will the final hit count as mine?\u201d Han Sen felt very nervous. The prospect of earning a deified beast soul was very enticing.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic deified hunted: Crystal God Conch. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had been dropped off at the pearly gates at heaven, only to fall way down into the fiery pits of hell. He had managed to get the kill, but he didn\u2019t get a deified beast soul.\n\n\u201cAnyway, at least I got the deified gene. That is the biggest reward,\u201d Han Sen mumbled to himself, but he still felt crestfallen.\n\nHan Sen sent the Crystal God Conch\u2019s body back to the sanctuaries. Lifeless items weren\u2019t destroyed in the sanctuaries, just like the baby Sun Raven\u2019s body.\n\nThe small black sea conches invading the blood kirin were gone. It was wounded, but it wasn\u2019t in any danger of death. With its lifeforce and recovery speed, it wouldn\u2019t take long for the blood kirin to be back in action.\n\nThe blood kirin began to feast on the flesh of the Move Mountain Sea Conch and what remained of the Electric Dragon. With gritted teeth, Han Sen gave the Move Mountain Sea Conch\u2019s xenogeneic gene to the blood kirin, as well. He wanted it to recover the power it had lost.\n\nIt was two days before he made it back to Underwater Town. By then, the wounds on the blood kirin were no longer visible, but it had yet to fully heal.\n\nThe blood kirin had been badly hurt by the Crystal God Conch, and the little sea conches had ravaged its organs. It had been really damaged. If it hadn\u2019t been given plenty of resources to heal, it would have taken a very long time for it to get better.\n\nHan Sen kept on exploring the underwater realms, but he was never able to find another King class xenogeneic. He didn\u2019t know why they had found two Kings and a deified in that one region.\n\nHan Sen wanted to go back to that cave and take a look, but he wasn\u2019t good at shrinking his body. That cave grew smaller the deeper it went. It eventually reached the width of a needle. Han Sen spent some time digging his way through but found nothing. He decided to give up after a while.\n\n\u201cI should take the blood kirin to King\u2019s Garden to heal,\u201d Han Sen decided.\n\nOf course, Han Sen had no intention of provoking the king tree again. He wanted to find a root king dragon there so he and the blood kirin could absorb some king air. If the blood kirin could absorb some of that king air, the healing process could be hastened.\n\nEven though Han Sen tried to keep a low profile, entering King\u2019s Garden still drew a lot of attention.\n\nIt was very hard to find a primary root king dragon that was unoccupied.\n\nHan Sen found one, and after looking closer, he smiled. He lifted his lips and said, \u201cWhat a shame! It is Prince Swordstar.\u201d\n\nHan Sen flew over to Prince Swordstar without hesitation.\n\nPrince Swordstar was sitting atop a primary root king dragon with a few of his guards. When he saw Han Sen coming toward him, his face changed.\n\n\u201cMy good little brother, haven\u2019t you heard that you should respect your elders? I am taking this primary root king dragon. Get lost,\u201d Han Sen said as he approached.\n\nPrince Swordstar was very annoyed that Han Sen had been released from prison by Miss Mirror. Now, hearing Han Sen say this, he was so angry that he shouted, \u201cI should respect our elders, but even if we give it to you, I doubt you\u2019d be capable of defending it! So, what is the point of you having it?\u201d\n\nOther princes and princesses knew that Prince Swordstar had brought Han Sen to the Sentencing Court. With Bai Yi\u2019s spiteful personality, everyone knew that he wasn\u2019t going to let go of the affront lightly. They turned excited eyes toward the brewing confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt looks like this big brother should teach you a lesson,\u201d Han Sen laughed coldly. His fist gathered up power, and he used the Extreme King\u2019s Shocking Sky Punch. He threw his fist toward Prince Swordstar, who was sitting on the dragon\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cGet them!\u201d Prince Swordstar barked, looking at the blood kirin in fear. He didn\u2019t dare fight.\n\nFour guards suddenly emerged from behind the dragon. Two of them were half-deified.\n\nOrdinarily, Han Sen would allow the blood kirin to fight. But the blood kirin was still injured, so he couldn\u2019t let him go forward.\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cLet this big brother teach you the invincible ways of a real Extreme King!\u201d\n\nAfter that, he sent an Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch toward all four guards.\n\n\u201cIs Bai Yi crazy?\u201d All the princes and princesses were shocked. They knew who Bai Yi really was.\n\nAlthough he had managed to claim the alpha statue and earn the protection of the Kingese, he still wasn\u2019t very high level. He was a first-tier King. With his power and Original Water King Body, he could fight a single half-deified, but it was simply arrogant to think he could take on four at once."
