    "text": "Han Sen stopped in his tracks. He couldn\u2019t figure out what had just happened.\n\nThe light spell was stuck to Seven Spirit\u2019s forehead. It shone brightly, and Qing Jun started to scream as it gleamed.\n\n\u201cWho dares to trick me in such a fashion?\u201d Sky God Qing Jun screamed. The gold fire began to lessen, and Han Sen saw a gold shadow writhing around Seven Spirit\u2019s body. It twisted as if it was in agony, which was extremely creepy to watch.\n\nAlthough he did not know what had happened, Han Sen knew his chance to act had come. Rather than continuing to watch the spectacle, he moved forward to swing his Ghost Teeth Knife.\n\nAs the knifelight slashed across Seven Spirit\u2019s body, Qing Jun and Seven Spirit lost control of the four-faced, eightarmed gold Buddha body form. He screamed in rage as Han Sen hit him, but it was useless.\n\nQing Jun\u2019s will was suppressed by the light spell. His scream turned to pain. He had possessed Seven Spirit, yes, but he could no longer exit the body.\n\nSeven Spirit\u2019s will was not strong enough to withstand the rhythm of the music. He could only watch as Han Sen continued to strike his hardy body.\n\nNo matter how strong his body was, though, it could not withstand a thousand hits. Lacerations began to appear across the gold Buddha body. Blood seeped out of the wounds, looking like liquid gold.\n\nHan Sen was cruel. He paid no mind to Qing Jun or Seven Spirit\u2019s cries.\n\n\u201cI will kill you\u2026 This has nothing to do with me\u2026 Kill you\u2026 It controlled me\u2026 You are killing a Buddha\u2026\u201d The four mouths spoke different words. Qing Jun and Seven Spirit were talking in tandem.\n\nHan Sen ignored them, though. He continued his rage of slashes.\n\nIf Seven Spirit had been controlled by Qing Jun, then the Buddha hadn\u2019t meant to kill Han Sen. But given how long Seven Spirit had been chasing Han Sen, why hadn\u2019t the Buddha tried to fight off Qing Jun\u2019s control?\n\nWithout a doubt, the Buddha had some reason to hope for Han Sen\u2019s death. It did not matter if Qing Jun had possessed Seven Spirit or not.\n\nSeven Spirit\u2019s roaring echoed across the heavenscape, but his struggles were futile. Han Sen delivered a thousand blows, striking Seven Spirit\u2019s neck over and over. Eventually, he was able to lop the head of four faces off. The gold blood squirted everywhere.\n\n\u201cMarquise-class xenogeneic hunted: Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha. Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha beast soul obtained. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nThat voice sounded inside Han Sen\u2019s head. He was glad he had managed to obtain some sort of reward, following the trial he had just been put through.\n\nSeven Spirit\u2019s xenogeneic body crumpled. The gold flames were not extinguished, though. The light spell was still sticking out of the fiery shadow\u2019s forehead.\n\nPang!\n\nThe light spell suddenly exploded. The gold flames shattered, and Qing Jun\u2019s roaring disappeared along with it. Nothing more remained.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs this was occurring, a ship departed the Buddha Kingdom. A man, dressed in rich clothes, was resting upon a seat. His mouth spoke words only meant for himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Qing Jun possessed someone. He had it coming. This damage will put him off for some time. What an *sshole, to think of touching one of the Han family.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen pulled out a bottle. He collected the blood of the Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha. Its blood was the xenogeneic part of its body.\n\nAfter everything was done, he took a look at the beast soul.\n\nViscount-class Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha: Soul Armor\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had seen armor beast souls before, and those were simply titled armor. Han Sen was unsure what soul armor meant. Without hesitation, Han Sen summoned the beast soul. A gold armor suddenly wrapped him up, and he could feel how powerful it was.\n\nIt resembled the gold armor for Geminis, but it looked like ordinary beast soul armor. It didn\u2019t look like anything special.\n\nHan Sen tried to generate power to punch with it, but as soon as he moved, the gold armor began to shine. A Four- Faced Eight-Armed Buddha appeared directly behind him, and when he punched, he did so with the Buddha\u2019s gold light. It had the same power that Seven Spirit had possessed.\n\n\u201cD*mn! This Soul Armor is strong.\u201d Han Sen was so happy, as he had never possessed armor like this before. Wearing the armor granted him the power of a Marquise. And since it was from Seven Spirit, it was even stronger than normal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if other people can see the Four-Faced Eight-Armed Gold Buddha that appears behind me. If they can, that might be bad,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he put the beast soul away. Then he looked over the Heaven.\n\nIn a hall of the Buddha, a candle went out. Burning Lamp Alpha\u2019s eyes widened, and many of the Nobles around him seemed stunned. Burning Lamp Alpha had not shown surprise in more than a thousand years.\n\n\u201cSeven Spirit is dead,\u201d Burning Lamp Alpha spoke slowly, with his face all twisted.\n\n\u201cWith Seven Spirit\u2019s power, there is no way Han Sen was able to\u2026\u201d The Buddha were in shock.\n\n\u201cHow\u2026 Wasn\u2019t Seven Spirit going to get the Knife Child?\u201d He knew he had misspoken when the Buddha King spoke the Buddha catchphrase.\n\n\u201cWhoever killed him must pay!\u201d Burning Lamp Alpha was calm, but his calm was frightening.\n\nSeven Spirit was his first student in a thousand years. Burning Lamp Alpha believed he had what it took to become deified. Now that he had simply died, Burning Lamp Alpha was furious.\n\n\u201cHan Sen\u2026 He\u2026 He\u2026\u201d A Buddha Duke that was watching over Heaven screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Clear Sea Buddha frowned at the Duke.\n\n\u201cHan Sen has reached the end!\u201d The Buddha Duke looked strange.\n\n\u201cWhat? He did? I thought he wasn\u2019t on the list.\u201d Clear Sea King did not believe it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he has. Come take a look.\u201d The Duke was having trouble explaining, so he waved at the Buddha mirror and instructed it to reveal Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nAll the Buddha Kings could clearly see that Han Sen had reached the other end.\n\n\u201cHe entered Heaven with Seven Spirit. Now he is making it out, and Seven Spirit is dead. He must have killed him.\u201d Burning Lamp Alpha stood up from his lotus seat. He walked towards the door of Heaven."
