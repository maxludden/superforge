As he approached to take the test, though, the guard asked that Han Sen wait a day.\n\nKing spirits and super creatures were unable to guard there every day, so the top-dogs upstairs would have to hold a discussion and see who would best supervise the test.\n\nUnfortunately, there was nothing Han Sen could do about that. So, he had no choice but to wait an entire day.\n\nThe spirits, creatures, and humans on the fourth floor were curious about what was going on.\n\nGoing to the fifth floor was quite the event, as it was a challenge beyond comprehension. What made it so remarkable was that a human was attempting to ascend. Humans were small and not worthy of much recognition in that shelter or anywhere else in the sanctuary, so learning the species of the challenger sparked the interest of everyone and everything there.\n\n\u201cOld Zhao, is Han Sen human?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked Cheng Hu and yep; he most certainly is!\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Do you think humans can actually reach the fifth floor?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but Qiu Ping said he was unable to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be great if he managed to succeed.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the palace on the fifth floor, three spirits and seven creatures sat before a table in deep discussion.\n\n\u201cDry Bone, it should be your turn this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me? Why don\u2019t you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid I would kill the boy in one hit. It would be a shame to simply terminate someone who has managed to come this far,\u201d Baby Ghost said.\n\n\u201cYou are much weaker than me; you actually think I\u2019d be unable to defeat him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We both know I am far stronger than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? Stronger? I\u2019m going to beat the sh*t out of you!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Bring it, you dry, crusty sack of bones!\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up; both of you!\u201d a female king spirit commanded. Immediately, Dry Bone and Baby Ghost went quiet and remained in their seats.\n\nThe seven creatures that were watching the discussion now turned to look at the female spirit. Their expressions were full of serious concern for the matters they were supposed to discuss.\n\n\u201cThis should be decided by Mister Immortal, but he\u2019s practicing right now, so we can\u2019t disturb him. Should I make the decision, then?\u201d The king spirit looked into the eyes of each.\n\nThe super creatures were fine with her making the decision, and Dry Bone and Baby Ghost said, \u201cQing Jun? Yes, you should be the one to decide.\u201d\n\nQing Jun panned the room until her eyes fell on Dry Bone. She told him, \u201cDry Bone, it is you who should go this time. Do your best and do not relent. Show us the true extent of your strength if you wish to share the Sky Fruit.\u201d\n\nDry Bone King said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone, prepare yourselves. We will go to another Sky Fruit in two days,\u201d Qing Jun said.\n\nThe super creatures promptly left, leaving only Dry Bone and Baby Ghost behind.\n\n\u201cDry Bone, you aren\u2019t going to kill him, are you?\u201d Baby Ghost asked.\n\nDry Bone answered, \u201cMister Immortal needs people. If that human is this strong, killing him means I am working against Mister Immortal. Of course I won\u2019t kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Qing Jun? It sounds like she wants you to kill him,\u201d Ghost Baby said.\n\nDry Bone said, \u201cIt has been twenty years. She is still unable to get over that business with the humans. I won\u2019t adhere to her command. And besides, if the human really is king-class in strength, I wouldn\u2019t be against having him sit on this same table as us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if he is not as strong as we have been led to believe?\u201d Baby Ghost asked.\n\nDry Bone laughed until his bones creaked, and then he said, \u201cThen I don\u2019t mind helping the mistress out.\u201d\n\nHan Sen waited in the shelter overnight. Eventually, a king spirit came to see him and bid that he go to the nearest Martial Hall.\n\nMany creatures and spirits had gathered there already. They all looked on Han Sen with grand curiosity, eager to see whether or not a human might actually be able to reach the fifth floor.\n\nA giant skeleton, clad in bone armor, stood inside the arena awaiting his combatant. He was four meters tall and looked frightening. His eyes were like red gemstones that were alive with an evil flame.\n\nHan Sen entered the arena and observed his opponent. It was a skeleton, but not creamy and dusty like the average one. Its bones looked to be composed of jade, and they glowed.\n\nThe bones of the skeleton had no gaps in between the joints, and it looked like a fire-forged warrior, straight from the pits of hell.\n\n\u201cYou are the human who wants to enter the fifth floor.\u201d Dry Bone examined the human before him, wondering whether or not he had the king-class power he was expecting.\n\nAs the red eyes peered at Han Sen, their brightness faded to indicate disappointment. His eyes were able to read Han Sen\u2019s fitness level.\n\nHan Sen had the strongest fitness he had ever seen a human possess, and he was leagues ahead of every other human.\n\nBut it still wasn\u2019t in the realm of strength a king-class spirit possessed.\n\n\u201cWith a fitness level like that, I doubt he\u2019s of the strength Mister Immortal is looking for. I suppose I\u2019ll just have to do Qing Jun a favor,\u201d Dry Bone King thought to himself.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nDry Bone King wasn\u2019t going to waste any more time on Han Sen than he had to. He clicked his fingers and said, \u201cIf you can last half an hour, you pass the test.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Dry Bone threw a punch towards Han Sen. The shockwaves it unleashed gave the punch the feeling it could sunder a mountain."
