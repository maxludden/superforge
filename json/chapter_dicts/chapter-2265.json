    "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me Han Sen is your fake name,\u201d Fox Queen said, smiling at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMy name is Han Sen. San Mu is just a nickname. Only close family and my bestest friends call me by that name,\u201d Han Sen said shyly.\n\nFox Queen rolled her eyes, but she wasn\u2019t going to push the subject any further. She looked back at Edward and the others and asked, \u201cAnd who are you people, exactly?\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King told her, \u201cWe are Ice Blue Knights of the Extreme King. Please do not misunderstand our intent, for we are only here to apprehend the criminal traitor known as Han Sen. We didn\u2019t mean to offend you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he do to incite your wrath?\u201d Fox Queen asked with curiosity. \u201cThis is quite the hunting party you\u2019ve assembled.\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King and Edward frowned. They had told her they were Extreme King deliberately, knowing that the name was feared all across the universe.\n\nBut when they looked at Fox Queen\u2019s face, they saw no hint of fear or trepidation. Their attempted name-drop had failed quite spectacularly.\n\nThe Shapeshifting Foxes weren\u2019t one of the top races, and even a deified fox should have been afraid of the Extreme King. However, Fox Queen seemed entirely unperturbed.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know was that the Extreme King only rose to prominence after Fox Queen had been incarcerated in the palace. Their name meant little to her, as they were a minor race back in her heyday.\n\n\u201cHe is a traitor in the Ice Blue Knights. It was difficult for us to locate him. Being the slithering, tricky little snake that he is, he managed to escape. He eluded us for a while, but we traced him all the way to this place. It was never our intention to offend you,\u201d Edward went on to say. His face was straining under the weight of his forced sincerity.\n\nHan Sen and Fox Queen had only exchanged a few words in front of Edward, but he could tell that the relationship between them wasn\u2019t very warm. So, he didn\u2019t mention the relic he sought.\n\nHan Sen had to be keeping the relic somewhere on his person. That meant they had a chance. If Edward mentioned the relic, and it was claimed by a deified being, they stood no chance of reclaiming it.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s face looked like stone. She held a cord of power and used it like a whip to lash Edward, who was still hanging in the air upside-down. His face was gashed as the whip tore so deeply into his flesh that it exposed the bone of his skull. Blood began to dribble through his hair.\n\nEveryone was shocked. Fox Queen did not say a word as she continued the whipping. A short time later, Edward was covered in open wounds and dripping blood.\n\n\u201cI was lying to people before your great-grandmother was even born. And you think you can deceive me? Do you want to die?\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s gaze was hard as she looked at the blood-soaked Edward. \u201cLet me ask you again: why are you chasing him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stole something very important from us! That is why we have been chasing him,\u201d Edward said.\n\n\u201cAnd what is this thing?\u201d Fox Queen frowned, but she stopped hitting Edward.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is!\u201d As Fox Queen started to move her hand, he immediately said, \u201cWe discovered an ancient city in the desert. Han Sen snuck in and stole an item from that city, although we\u2019re not sure what it was. If you would like to know what he stole, then you will have to ask him.\u201d\n\nFox Queen looked carefully at Edward and the others, then she turned to Han Sen. With a smile, she said, \u201cMy good brother San Mu, it looks like you\u2019ve already retrieved the item from that city you mentioned. Very good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did take something from that old city.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s eyes looked sharp. Even to her, any item that had belonged to the Sacred Leader would be quite tempting.\n\nHan Sen smiled. He had no intention of revealing the stone plate to anyone. He merely said, \u201cSister, which you would prefer: this item or your freedom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very greedy. I want freedom and the item.\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s cord of power suddenly moved. It was headed for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen shot off to the side hall, wanting to race right into the hellish skeletal gate.\n\nAs soon as Han Sen appeared in the side hall, Fox Queen\u2019s cord of power was already on him. But suddenly, a bird\u2019s nest appeared in Han Sen\u2019s hand. Inside it, there was a red egg.\n\nThe cord of power could bind a half-deified elite easily, but when it touched the bird\u2019s nest, it snapped like dry twine.\n\nAs the attack dissipated, Han Sen flapped his wings and escaped through a slither-of-a-gap between the substance chains coming for him. Then he leaped straight through the hellish skeletal gate.\n\nFox Queen was shocked. When she entered the White Bone Hell after him, Han Sen was already gone. She had limited power and mobility in that place, so she could only stand atop the skeleton mountain and glower after Han Sen. She couldn\u2019t chase him any further.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, do you want to grow old and die inside the White Bone Hell?\u201d Fox Queen squinted as she looked around.\n\n\u201cThere are worse ways to die than in the company of a pretty lady like you.\u201d Han Sen stood far away atop a distant peak and smiled at Fox Queen.\n\nFox Queen didn\u2019t say another word. She returned to the palace.\n\nBack inside the palace, Fox Queen looked at Edward and the others. She waved her hand, tossing everyone other than Mister White through the hellish skeletal gate.\n\n\u201cBring Han Sen and the item back to me, or die here,\u201d Fox Queen commanded. Edward and the others were then tossed into the hellish skeletal gate.\n\nAs the others shakily stood up and began moving off into the White Bone Hell, Fox Queen turned back to Mister White. \u201cYou know how to break the restrictions of this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a little.\u201d Mister White nodded.\n\n\u201cBreaking the front gate\u2026 That was no easy task.\u201d Fox Queen raised her lips in a slight smile.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw Edward and the others fly into the White Bone Hell face first, he knew exactly what was going on. He immediately retreated to the blood kirin\u2019s lotus mountain.\n\nEdward and the others stared mutely at the white bone world around them. They were just as stunned as Han Sen had been when he first entered that place.\n\nCrime concentrated as he activated a special power. In a few seconds, he detected Han Sen sneaking his way over to the lotus mountains. \u201cHe\u2019s over there!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King barked the command, and they all took off in pursuit of Han Sen.\n\nThe White Bone Hell was so large that it would be difficult to find Han Sen again if he got too far away from them.\n\nAnd because of Fox Queen\u2019s implied threat, they now had even more motivation for retrieving that relic.\n\nIce Blue Knight King was the fastest of the bunch, so he arrived at the lotus mountain first. Just as he was about to enter, however, he suddenly felt a blood air rise from the lotus mountaintop.\n\nHe had been sprinting forward at full speed, and his momentum kept him from changing direction quickly. He gathered up his strength and sent a wave of deep blue power against the tide of red.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe blood air ripped straight through Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s deep blue power. The attack tore through the armor on his chest without even slowing down, and blood began to spurt from his chest with unnatural speed. It was as if some power was sucking the blood out of him."
