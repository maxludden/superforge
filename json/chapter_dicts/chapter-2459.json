    "text": "The woman quirked her lips into a smile. Running her hand through her hair, she said, \u201cBecoming Super Gene means killing these guys who call themselves God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you trying to do that?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He knew how scary those beings were. But luckily, they couldn\u2019t directly attack the beings of the universe. Their powers were much stronger than any creature within the geno universe. Not even deified beings could be compared to them.\n\nThe woman and Sacred Leader had wanted to kill these self-proclaimed gods. And Han Sen shared their insane desire. He just wasn\u2019t strong enough right now, so he didn\u2019t know how he would eventually bring the gods down.\n\nBecause of this, Han Sen had no plans to kill a god just yet. When he had been inside Destiny\u2019s Tower of the Extreme King, he had only seen the statue of a god. If the black crystal armor hadn\u2019t helped him, he would have been incapable of defeating the thing.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t imagine how scary things might have been if he faced a real god.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why Sacred Leader was pursuing this goal, but I know I had my reasons,\u201d the woman obviously, obviously not wanting to share her actual reason.\n\n\u201cHaving a Super Gene can allow a person to kill those gods?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cAccording to my research, yes. That is correct.\u201d The woman nodded, speaking with certainty.\n\nBut then the woman shook her head, smiling wryly. \u201cBut our research still failed. We discovered a method that could turn a body into a Super Gene, but there was no creature in this universe that could use this method. It was like we were holding a candle, and we knew we could light it, but we didn\u2019t have a single match to do so. We were so close to dispelling the darkness, but we couldn\u2019t. That was the difficulty we faced. The thing that we lacked to complete The Story of Genes seemed like an insurmountable barrier. It made all of our efforts seem fairly pointless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs The Story of Genes that difficult to practice? There really wasn\u2019t anyone across the entire universe who could use it?\u201d Han Sen asked in confusion. After all, he had already learned The Story of Genes.\n\nThe woman thought for a moment, then said, \u201cThis problem is very complicated, and explaining it fully would take some time. Let me use an analogy instead. A horse needs to eat plants for energy, so it can stay alive and run. However, a car requires fuel in order to operate. You cannot give the horse fuel, and you cannot give the car grass. This description isn\u2019t perfect, but it sort of gets across what I mean. The Story of Genes has many requirements, and there is no creature in the universe that can satisfy every one of them. You cannot lack in any department.\u201d\n\nHan Sen pretended to understand, but he actually rather confused. He started to ask another question, but he just didn\u2019t know how to explain what he didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cWho are those people that call themselves Gods? Why can only those with a Super Gene kill them?\u201d Han Sen returned the conversation to the initial question.\n\n\u201cThat question is also complicated. To put it simply, these gods are creatures, but they exist in a different way than we do. It\u2019s like the difference between corporeal life forms and spirits. But the reality is more complicated, especially when one tries to understand how they interact with our universe.\u201d The woman paused, and then she went on to say, \u201cAnd you asked why those with a Super Gene can kill those who claim to be gods? It all began with a test conducted by the Sacred Leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat test?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t answer Han Sen. She stood up and said, \u201cOkay, the garden\u2019s clean now. Don\u2019t you dare make this place dirty again! If you do, I\u2019ll turn you into a pig.\u201d\n\nHan Sen still hung in the air, not daring to touch the ground. He was worried she really would do what she claimed. Considering the woman\u2019s power, she probably had a stronger gene-altering skill than Burning Lamp Alpha did.\n\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what sort of test the Sacred Leader conducted,\u201d Han Sen said to the woman as he hovered in the air.\n\nThe woman turned around and looked at Han Sen. \u201cWhy do I have to tell you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know how to respond. She had no connection to him, and she didn\u2019t owe him anything. There really was no reason for her to tell him.\n\nPang!\n\nWhile Han Sen\u2019s mind raced for an answer, the woman returned to the house and slammed the door.\n\n\u201cShould I tell this woman I have practiced The Story of Genes? If I tell her, I might learn more secrets from her. But she also might catch me and use me as some sort of lab rat. That would be bad.\u201d Han Sen found it to be quite the dilemma, and he was torn on what to do.\n\nThe woman had said Han Sen wasn\u2019t allowed to touch her stuff. Han Sen didn\u2019t want to upset her cleanliness and OCD, so he flew over the fence and landed on the ground outside. He sat there, looking up at the yellow clouds. He pulled out the Wanjie Rubix Cube and sent a video to the Treasure Identifier Elder.\n\nWhen the Treasure Identifier Elder had played Han Sen last video, it had drawn the focus of all the other races.\n\nThat light-yellow clouds became the focus of many elites. When this new video came out, many factions were able to confirm Han Sen\u2019s location based on the changes in the cloud patterns.\n\nBut because the demon spirit was probably close by, no one dared to go.\n\nThe Extreme King wasn\u2019t very concerned about it, though. Bao Qin had retreated after he was injured, but the Extreme King had hurriedly sent out more deified elites to prowl through the Tianxia System.\n\nHan Sen sat on the island for hours, trying to decide whether or not he should tell the woman that he had practiced The Story of Genes.\n\nSuddenly, the sea of clouds rumbled. Many giant cloud dragons came roaring out of the veil, pulling the Sea Demon Car to the island.\n\n\u201cThe demon spirit is here!\u201d Han Sen was shocked, and he hastily decided to run.\n\nThe woman hadn\u2019t killed him, but that didn\u2019t mean that the demon spirit would spare him.\n\n\u201cYou come in,\u201d said the woman. He looked up to see her head poking out a window.\n\nHan Sen answered by running into the garden.\n\n\u201cFeet.\u201d The woman frowned.\n\nHan Sen quickly jumped into the air. He flew through the garden, then floated into the house, being careful not to touch anything. He hung in the center of the building, as far away from all of the house\u2019s contents as he could get.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything, and don\u2019t make a noise,\u201d the woman advised him with a frown.\n\nHan Sen nodded but made no further answer.\n\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d The woman smiled, pleased with Han Sen\u2019s performance.\n\nJust like the previous two times that Han Sen had seen, the demon spirit stood outside the fence and stared up at the window. The woman ignored him for half the day, becoming grumpier with every second that passed. In the end, she couldn\u2019t help but open the window and shout at him.\n\nWhen the woman grew tired of yelling and subsided into silence, the demon spirit left. It was as if he had come there just so the woman could shout at him. Whatever was going on between the two of them, they obviously had a lot of history.\n\nHan Sen was curious about the relationship between the woman and the demon spirit, but he knew it would be best not to ask the woman just yet. He could see the anger and scorn still etched deeply into her face.\n\n\u201cDo you want to know who that is?\u201d the woman asked. She turned around, her intense eyes landing on Han Sen like physical weights.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Han Sen shook his head without thinking. He felt fear when she asked him, and he knew nothing good would come from that particular answer.\n\nThe woman was shocked, but she laughed. She narrowed her eyes slightly as she examined Han Sen. \u201cDo you want to know what sort of test Sacred Leader conducted?\u201d"
