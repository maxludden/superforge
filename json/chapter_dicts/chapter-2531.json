    "text": "After Dia Robber departed, Han Sen and the others continued their search for the Sea Sky Eye. They were unable to find the Sea Sky Eye, but they did find royal knights of the Extreme King.\n\nWhen crown prince Bai Wan Jie saw Han Sen and the others, he brought the royal knights with him to fly over and meet with them. He looked at Dollar and said, \u201cBrother Dollar, this is a coincidence. I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas the crown prince been looking for me?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Bai Wan Jie. He frowned and thought, \u201cWhy would Bai Wan Jie be here? And why has he brought so many royal knights with him? Surely, it cannot be for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess. I would like to hire Brother Dollar to hunt a xenogeneic. Please, name your price,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of xenogeneic are you looking to kill?\u201d Han Sen had a bad feeling about this.\n\n\u201cThe Sea Sky Eye,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said simply, not trying to hide his intentions.\n\nThe name rippled over Han Sen and the others in a wave. They couldn\u2019t believe such a coincidence had come about. Bai Wan Jie had picked this time to come and kill the Sea Sky Eye.\n\nLi Keer\u2019s face looked shocked, but in her heart, she had known that this might happen. She didn\u2019t really need to kill the Sea Sky Eye. She had only asked Han Sen to kill a xenogeneic with her so that she would have an opportunity to get close to him.\n\nShe knew the Extreme King wanted to slay the Sea Sky Eye, which was why she had picked this deified in particular. She wanted to see how Dollar might react to the Extreme King stepping on his toes. If Han Sen offended the Extreme King, she could step in and smooth things over. That way, Han Sen would owe her a favor.\n\nHan Sen hesitated, but he still admitted the truth to Bai Wan Jie. \u201cMy Prince, I am sorry. I have already accepted the task of slaying the Sea Sky Eye.\u201d\n\nBai Wan Jie\u2019s eyes widened. He looked at Dragon One, squinted his eyes, and asked, \u201cDragon One, the Dragon have just hunted the Gold Armor General. Now you are here to hunt the Sea Sky Eye? You are richer than I thought.\u201d\n\nDragon One shook his head. \u201cThis time, we aren\u2019t the ones who have hired him. The Dragons aren\u2019t after the Sea Sky Eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who? The Destroyed?\u201d Bai Wan Jie looked at Han Sen with a raised eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIt is me.\u201d Li Keer immediately stepped forward, not waiting for Han Sen to answer.\n\n\u201cAre you from Sky Palace?\u201d Upon seeing Li Keer there, Bai Wan Jie frowned.\n\nSky Palace wasn\u2019t stronger than the Extreme King, but they had the Very High backing them up. Because of that, the Extreme King had to be careful about offending the Sky.\n\nThe Extreme King\u2019s name was enough to back down the Dragon and the Destroyed, but it couldn\u2019t put much pressure on Sky Palace.\n\n\u201cWhat if I am?\u201d Li Keer replied coldly.\n\n\u201cCompetition is good fun. Let\u2019s see which of us has what it takes, then.\u201d Bai Wan Jie smiled. Then, he spoke to Han Sen. \u201cIf Brother Dollar is willing to help us, then no price is too high. I believe you know all about the power of the Extreme King. We can offer you much help, so you can kill the Sea Sky Eye with far greater ease.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Prince, thank you, but no thank you. Business is established on the foundation of trust. I have already accepted Li Keer\u2019s task. I must keep my promise to her,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I won\u2019t force you to help us. If you change your mind, however, come and look for me.\u201d Bai Wan Jie nodded, then led the royal knights away.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, the Extreme King isn\u2019t like an ordinary high race. You might not be afraid of them in the core area, but if they come after you outside the core area, you are sure to encounter a lot of trouble.\u201d Dragon One frowned at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t afraid of the Extreme King. It would be impossible for the Extreme King to find him, and even if they could, he had already offended them. Insulting them further couldn\u2019t make things any worse than they currently were.\n\n\u201cIf Brother Dollar thinks something is amiss, then we can cancel our deal,\u201d Li Keer offered gently.\n\nHan Sen laughed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hunt the Sea Sky Eye, that\u2019s fine. But if you still want to, I will do my best to help you kill it.\u201d\u2018\n\n\u201cOf course I want to hunt the fiend, but I don\u2019t want to bring you unnecessary trouble,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind trouble as long as I can earn money.\u201d Han Sen chuckled again.\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter Bai Wan Jie left with his people, Nightmare Knight approached and said, \u201cMy Prince, Dollar is going to hunt the Sea Sky Eye. What are we going to do about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us find Sea Sky Eye first. We will have to kill it before he does. We cannot miss it this time,\u201d Bai Wan Jie rumbled.\n\nAt first, he had wanted to ask Dollar for help. That way, there would be a greater chance of success, and many rare Extreme King items and resources wouldn\u2019t have to be wasted. But he had failed to hire Dollar, and he was now in competition with the man. Bai Wan Jie couldn\u2019t dwell on this too much. He needed to kill the Sea Sky Eye before his opposition. He couldn\u2019t accept having another repeat of what went down with the Gold Armor General.\n\nGiving up the Gold Armor General hadn\u2019t cost Bai Wan Jie too much, but he couldn\u2019t just abandon his hunt for the Sea Sky Eye. It wouldn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThe people of the Extreme King were fervently seeking the Sea Sky Eye. Han Sen knew he couldn\u2019t search any faster than the Extreme King could, so he didn\u2019t bother searching by himself. He decided to follow the Extreme King.\n\nIf they found the Sea Sky Eye and had a battle, things would quickly become chaotic. He might have an opportunity.\n\n\u201cKeer, can you tell me what the Sea Sky Eye does?\u201d Han Sen watched the Extreme King look for the Sea Sky Eye like mad, and he found his curiosity piqued.\n\nLi Keer hesitated, but then said, \u201cI suppose I can tell you. The Sea Sky Eye core xenogeneic gene is the primary material for creating Sky Eye replicas.\u201d\n\n\u201cSky Eye replicas? Like Sky Palace\u2019s Sky Eyes?\u201d Dragon One grunted. He looked at Li Keer in disbelief.\n\nLi Keer nodded, but she didn\u2019t elaborate any further.\n\nDragon One\u2019s face was shocked. \u201cI see. No wonder Bai Wan Jie wants to kill the Sea Sky Eye so badly. With their power, killing most deified core xenogeneics would take more valuable resources than they stand to earn if they are victorious. If Sea Sky Eye can make a replica Sky Eye, however, the price they are paying will be worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Sky Eye?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion. He had been in Sky Palace for a long time, but he had never heard of them before.\n\nDragon One looked at Li Keer and didn\u2019t answer Han Sen.\n\nLi Keer laughed harshly and said, \u201cThe Sky Eye is the primary defense of Sky Palace. All of Sky Palace\u2019s defensive systems depend on their Sky Eye. In regards to the strength of the defensive systems, Sky Palace\u2019s defenses are stronger than the Extreme King\u2019s. And that is all because of the Sky Eye. The Extreme King want to kill the Sea Sky Eye to create a defensive system as powerful as the Sky\u2019s. While this core xenogeneic might not yield a genuine Sky Eye, it could greatly increase the defensive power of the Extreme King.\u201d"
