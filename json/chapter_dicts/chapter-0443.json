    "text": "The snow spider and the black bird which were severely injured tried to escape in the chaos. However, the creatures from the spirit shelter threw themselves at the two sacred-blood creatures, preventing them from leaving.\n\nIf it were under any other circumstances, either the snow spider or the black bird could easily fight or even killed these creatures. However, they had just been severely injured and almost killed by the monster, which made it hard for them to even breach the siege of the creatures.\n\nThe aristocrat spirit did not pause at all, attacking the snow spider with the spear in her hands.\n\nHan Sen suddenly understood that the aristocrat spirit had the same plan as he did. She wanted to get rid of the monster in order to pick up some easy gains.\n\nGo ahead. I wonder who the real winner would be. Han Sen watched the fight from behind the ice wall and chuckled inwardly.\n\nAlthough both the snow spider and blackbird were dying, they were, after all, sacred-blood creatures. With her primitive and mutant creatures, the aristocrats spirit still suffered a great loss trying to kill them.\n\nBodies of ice-armored beasts were lying everywhere. More than half of the ice-armored beasts had been injured or died. Several mutant creatures were also killed and injured. The aristocrats spirit did not change her expression, as if she did not care about the death of the creatures at all. She was focused on looking for the weaknesses of the two sacred-blood creatures.\n\nIt was easy to tell that the aristocrat spirit\u2019s purpose was not to kill these two sacred-blood creatures, otherwise she would have done so already.\n\nThe snow spider and black bird were injured too seriously. Wrapped by the spider silk, the black bird could hardly move. If the aristocrat spirit meant to kill it, she had had the opportunity a long while ago.\n\nObviously, it was not what she wanted. It seemed that she wanted to enslave the two sacred-blood creatures, which was why she did not want to kill them. The two sacred-blood creatures had been injured really bad. It looked like they were about to die.\n\nThe snow spider had a weaker physique, so it could barely stand at this point. Bleeding all over, it was about to die at any minute.\n\n\"Squeak!\" The snow spider suddenly made a weird sound at the aristocrat spirit, taking back all eight spider legs, and lay on its stomach.\n\nSeeing the behavior of the snow spider, the aristocrats spirit immediately brandished her spear to signal the creatures to stop their attacks on the snow spider and turn to the black bird instead.\n\nThe aristocrat spirit walked up to the snow spider and held the spear horizontally. With ripples passing her body, her armor turned into the priest rope again, and the red stripes disappeared from the crystal spear, which then turned to a staff.\n\nShe held the sparkling crystal staff high and touched the head of the snow spider with the gemstone sitting on top of the staff.\n\nThe snow spider shivered, wanting to get away from the sparkling staff, but in the end, it only squeaked softly and accepted.\n\nSeeing her staff was about to touch the head of the spider, the female spirit could not help smiling.\n\nHowever, at this very moment, she quickly changed her expression. Moving quickly to the right, she was already too late.\n\nA figure suddenly flashed past the aristocrat spirit, holding a dagger that looked like a wolf tooth backward and slashing it at her neck.\n\nThe aristocrat spirit stepped back, her staff falling to the ground. She covered her snow-white neck with both hands, staring at the grinning man with the dagger in his hand. Blood was welling between her fingers.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your help. I will never forget you. I will go to your place another time to thank you by asking for your service,\" Han Sen said to the female spirit with a smile. Without any pause, he jumped to the kneeling snow spider and stabbed his dagger into its face.\n\nSqueak!\n\nThe snow spider squeaked painfully, trying to stand up, but it was too late. Han Sen moved the dagger to slice the spider\u2019s head open, and blood and brain squirted from the injury. The snow spider fell to the ground.\n\n\"Sacred-blood creature snow spider killed. No beast soul gained. Eat its meat to gain 0 to 10 sacred geno points.\"\n\nHan Sen lamented the fact that he did not gain a beast soul when hearing the voice.\n\nSeeing that Han Sen killed the sacred-blood snow spider, the aristocrat spirit bristled and tried to say something. However, when she opened her mouth, blood jetted out, and she turned into scattering sparkles with no words left.\n\n\"Rest in peace,\" Han Sen said quietly, running toward the other sacred-blood creature, the black bird.\n\nThe creatures that followed the aristocrats spirit scattered and the ran away after she was killed. Han Sen did not have time to pay them any mind. Both primitive and mutant creatures were always abundant, which he had plenty of opportunities to kill. However, it was very hard to find a sacred-blood creature, so he could not let this chance go.\n\nThe black bird was no stronger than the snow spider. It did not cost Han Sen any efforts to behead it.\n\n\"Young sacred-blood creature evil-blooded condor killed. Beast soul of evil-blooded condor gained. Eat its meat to gain 0 to 10 sacred-blood geno points.\"\n\nHearing the voice in his mind, Han Sen was so thrilled that he almost jumped. A sacred-blood creature beast soul! That was his first sacred-blood beast soul in Second God\u2019s Sanctuary. A sacred-blood beast soul in Second God\u2019s Sanctuary was much stronger than a super beast soul from First God\u2019s Sanctuary. Without the ability to kill super creatures in Second God\u2019s Sanctuary yet, this was already the best beast soul Han Sen could get his hands on at this point.\n\nThe other creatures had all run away, and Han Sen was in no mood to chase after them. He could not wait to see what type of beast soul his newly gained one was.\n\nHan Sen was looking forward to having a shapeshifting beast soul the most, or a beast soul armor would do as well.\n\nThe former could enhance his ability to fight to a great extent, while the latter could increase his survival rates significantly. They were both great options.\n\nType of beast soul of evil-blooded condor: glyph.\n\nSeeing the introduction to the newly gained beast soul, Han Sen was dazed. What kind of beast soul is a beast soul glyph?\n\nBecause there were too many types of beast souls, all they learned in school was some common types. As human became stronger and stronger in God\u2019s Sanctuary, more creatures had been killed and more types of beast souls were known. There were many newly discovered beast souls that one had to explore oneself.\n\nOf course, if one reported the discovery of a new type of beast soul to the Alliance, some rewards could be claimed after the type was verified."
