    "text": "It was a shame Han Sen did not find any other true god xenogeneics inside Nine-Defense Palace. He could not do this again.\n\nAfter exiting Nine-Defense Palace, Han Sen noticed Bao Ying had been waiting for him outside the place.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Han Sen asked while looking at Bao Ying.\n\n\u201cThe king wants to see you on your way out,\u201d Bao Ying said.\n\n\u201cBai King wants to see me? Is he going to reveal things to me?\u201d Han Sen tried guessing the reason. He followed Bao Ying to the top floor of the Extreme King tower where Bai King was.\n\nExtreme King Tower was a practice room for all the Extreme King\u2019s kings to use. Aside from the king, no one could make use of it. Not even their closest allies, wives, or children were permitted access.\n\nYet, Bai King had been willing to meet him in that place. If that was true, something was definitely going to happen.\n\nHan Sen knew that it was unlikely for him to be capable of defeating Bai King as he was, but he was confident that he had the chops to escape. He carefully entered the Extreme King Tower.\n\nBao Ying did not follow because she did not have permission to set foot inside Extreme King Tower.\n\nExtreme King Tower\u2019s furnishings were fairly simple. The inner area was made of stone. It looked like yellow jade. It gave people a warm and relaxed feeling. It was a totally different architectural style to the rest of the Extreme King\u2019s places.\n\nThere were no exotic xenogeneics around. Nor were there any powerful treasures lying about. One could not even see xenogeneic materials there. The furnishing were all very simple.\n\nHan Sen walked to the Extreme King Tower\u2019s top floor, but he did not see anything special along the way.\n\n\u201cHoly Baby is here! Come in!\u201d Bai King\u2019s voice boomed from the top floor. The closed stone gate opened.\n\nHan Sen saw Bai King sitting upon a yellow jade stone. He was wearing casual clothing. If his presence hadn\u2019t been so special, would not have been able to tell that the person before them was the leader of the Extreme King.\n\n\u201cSit down.\u201d Bai King pointed at the stone chair next to him.\n\nHan Sen did not mind this, so he sat down as he asked, \u201cMy King, why have you asked to see me?\u201d\n\nBai King smiled at Han Sen. \u201cToday, I have come looking for you because there is something I need your help with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very weak, so how can I help?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYou should know that I have many sons and daughters. Although they are not all talented, they are not bad. So, there is something that has really annoyed me about this. If you were me, which son or daughter would you give the throne to?\u201d Bai King seemed to be very troubled. He was holding his jaw.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. \u201cThis is a big matter that concerns the whole of the Extreme King. I am just an outsider. I should be holding my tongue!\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not expect Bai King to ask him about that.\n\n\u201cYou are my only student, so you are not an outsider,\u201d Bai King casually said. \u201cThere is no need to worry. Just tell me how you feel.\u201d\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Han Sen said, \u201cI do not really know much about your sons and daughters, but I have heard the most talented one is Bai Wuchang whereas the smartest one is Bai Wanjie.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen said that, an evil thought crossed his mind. They were two biological brothers that had the same mother and same father. If Bai King was really going to choose one of them, there was every chance they would end up fighting for the throne.\n\nBai King seemed to see through what Han Sen was thinking. He squinted his eyes, looked at Han Sen, and said, \u201cI am not allowing you to decide, so you can ask me a harder question. You just need to tell me who you would choose if you had to pick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was me, I would select Bai Wanjie.\u201d Han Sen knew being evil and manipulative with Bai King would not work. So, he just answered him straight.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Bai King looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\n\u201cBai Wanjie is already a crown prince,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cIf you select another crown prince, there is bound to be trouble. Plus, Bai Wanjie is very successful already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said Bai Wuchang is more talented,\u201d Bai King said. \u201cWhy not pick him?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter how talented someone is as a fighter. He might be strong, but that does not mean he can manage an entire nation. Compared to Bai Wanjie, I would say Bai Wanjie is a better manager.\u201d In fact, that was how Han Sen really felt. He was not a qualified manager either, so his own affairs were messy. Fortunately, Zero, Little Angel, Huangfu Jing, Qin Xuan, and the others were helping him. Without their help, it would be hard for him to maintain order whether he was in Planet Eclipse or Space Garden. A lot of problems would easily arise without them.\n\nBai King nodded and stopped talking about it. He paused and said, \u201cRight now, Wanjie and Wuchang and a few other sons and daughters are deified. I am planning to open the Starter King\u2019s Land for them to practice inside, but Starter King\u2019s Land is very dangerous. Even by leveling up to deified, venturing there does not mean they are guaranteed to return. So, I need people to protect them. When their lives are threatened, you must ensure they live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are countless Extreme King elites. Aren\u2019t there many true god elites to? Just send any.\u201d Han Sen knew Bai King wanted him to babysit them, but he did not want to go babysitting.\n\n\u201cI can find a way to protect them, but that would ensure they depend on their bodyguards,\u201d Bai King said with a laugh. \u201cIt will hamper their practice, so it must be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely cannot do this. With the little power I have, I can barely protect myself. How am I supposed to protect them?\u201d Han Sen shook his head. In the time he had, he would prefer to kill a few more xenogeneics to fill up his deified gene tally.\n\n\u201cYou can, and that is because you are Dollar,\u201d Bai King said with a smile.\n\nWith a wry smile, Han Sen thought \u201cAh, you were able to tell I was Dollar.\u201d He did not admit it, but he did not deny it. \u201cWhy are you giving such an important task to an outsider like me?\u201d he asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about me protecting them but failing in some capacity? Then all your sons and daughters would end up dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d Bai King said with certainty. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not know what to say. He did not know why Bai King was this confident and being so nice.\n\nBai King paused, smiled, and said, \u201cEven if they all end up dead, I can make a few more babies. I am not that old yet.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was speechless. He could not refuse this task, so he accepted it. After all, he had taken so many goodies from Bai King, so it was hard to refuse the offer.\n\nAside from protecting the sons and daughters, Bai King told Han Sen that he could also practice in Starter King\u2019s Land. This would help Han Sen level up.\n\nHan Sen was confused about that, so he just nodded."
