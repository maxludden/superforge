    "text": "Han Sen and company walked across Sodi for several hundred miles, and in that distance, he was unable to kill a single xenogeneic. There were too many Dukes and Marquises already taking advantage of the planet\u2019s offerings. Han Sen saw many Dukes and Marquises fighting and killing xenogeneics before he could reach them. No one was leaving Han Sen a single xenogeneic to fight himself. And if Han Sen drew close to the others, they\u2019d stare him down as if they were ready to start a fight if he took another step.\n\nHan Sen walked forward, hoping to head deeper into the mountains. Han Sen was at the foot of the rise when Qing Li and a number of other Rebates approached. \u201cHan Sen, are you here to kill xenogeneics? Well, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just taking a look around.\u201d Han Sen coughed.\n\nQing Li lifted her lips. \u201cWe have been walking across these mountains for over half the day, and we haven\u2019t been able to locate a single xenogeneic. Those b*stards down there are going to kill them all before we get a chance to.\u201d\n\nThe few Rebates of Duke and Marquise class looked tired. Everyone was using the excuse of finding the traitor to exploit the Six Star xenogeneic space. And because of that, the Rebate were losing so much.\n\nBut they had to relent and allow this due to the pressure that the Destroyed were putting on them. If that powerful race hadn\u2019t been leaning on them so heavily, the Rebate would have never let them in.\n\nAs the two were speaking, however, someone else approached. It was a group of the Destroyed. Most of them were Marquises, but the leader of the bunch was a Duke.\n\nThat team of Destroyed were out in pursuit of the traitor. But when they saw Han Sen, they immediately looked hostile.\n\nThat was because in Metal World, Han Sen had taken the effort to protect the other races. The Destroyed there, however, had been completely wiped out. And after those events, no other race was very fond of the Destroyed. Their reputation had taken a tumble, and they had paid a high price. That was why they were not fond of Han Sen.\n\nBut still, they did not actually try to attack him. They just looked at him with distaste. They were still in territory that belonged to the Rebate, after all, and they weren\u2019t arrogant enough to fight him there.\n\nJust as the Destroyed were about to leave, the face of the Duke leader changed. He shouted at the mountains, \u201cBarr!\u201d\n\nHan Sen and the others looked in the direction that he had called. They saw a man with bone armor. He was carrying a bone knife that was around two meters long on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the Destroyed?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Barr with a quizzical expression.\n\nBarr had three faces, but he did not have the traditional six arms. His three faces were different than those of the Destroyed, as well. The three faces were all masculine.\n\nQing Li\u2019s face changed, and she quietly said, \u201cDo not provoke him. He is, for lack of a better word, abnormal amongst the Destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Han Sen quietly asked.\n\nQing Li quickly explained, \u201cHe is a mix between one of the Destroyed and someone of another race. He is very talented, but also very cruel. The Destroyed love violence, but even they call him by the name of Born Destroyer. See how scary he is?\u201d\n\nA Rebate Duke quickly told Han Sen, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We cannot provoke him. He is also a part-time hitman, and he\u2019s killed geniuses that belong to all races. Many powerful people have died by his hand. To me, it sounds like you might be in danger.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned, but he did not move. He had noticed that Barr was already coming after him. Barr\u2019s energy had already locked onto him, and he couldn\u2019t run.\n\nHan Meng\u2019er felt Barr\u2019s focus on Han Sen, as well. She stepped in front of Han Sen and summoned her Death Goddess bow. She pulled its string, and a black beam arrow manifested. The arrow tip was trained on Barr.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy? Put the bow down!\u201d Seeing Han Meng\u2019er lift a bow and aim it at Barr, Qing Li and the others started to freak out.\n\nA person like Barr would merrily murder someone if they were only suffering a bad mood. Han Meng\u2019er was now pointing her loaded bow at him, so they imagined it to be something of a death wish.\n\nThe group of Destroyed were coldly smiling at them. But even though they were of the same race as Barr, there was an element of fear in their faces. They didn\u2019t want much contact with Barr, either. And now, one of Han Sen\u2019s people was aiming a bow at him.\n\nThe few Destroyed started to backtrack a little, so they could comfortably watch the show that was about to unfold. It seemed as if a killing fest was about to begin.\n\nHan Meng\u2019er did not put the bow down. She coldly watched Barr approach, and as she did, her bow gathered up more power.\n\nShe was only a Marquise, and Barr was a Duke. But Barr was hostile to Han Sen, and so she wouldn\u2019t back down.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, tell her to stand down!\u201d a Rebate Duke next to Qing Li said.\n\n\u201cThere is no need,\u201d Han Sen said coldly.\n\nThe bow in Han Meng\u2019er\u2019s hand was fully-charged. Without a moment of hesitation, she fired at Barr.\n\nThe arrow had been created from a formless swirl of black smoke, and it became almost impossible to see as it flashed towards Barr. It flew near him, ready to perforate his heart.\n\nEveryone was shocked. They thought Han Meng\u2019er was incredibly brave to take the first shot at Barr.\n\nThe Rebate Dukes didn\u2019t dare say a single word, though. They were afraid Barr would go crazy on them all. So, the Duke pulled on Qing Li and the others to leave. They wanted to get as far away from Han Meng\u2019er and Han Sen as possible, so they could avoid getting involved in their dispute.\n\nThe Destroyed stepped back even more, as well. They were still smiling coldly. They looked at Han Meng\u2019er as if she was a dead woman.\n\nBarr was not only a cruel fellow. The others did not know much about him, but the Destroyed most certainly did.\n\nHe had been given the title of Born Destroyer by the leader of the Destroyed himself. He was the strongest out of all of the Destroyed.\n\nIf Barr had been a pure-blood Destroyed, his talent would have most certainly given him the opportunity to become the next leader of the whole Destroyed race.\n\nAlthough Barr had not received much support from the Destroyed, he still did far better than most others of the Destroyed. Especially those of the same level as he was. And because he loved killing, his name was deeply associated with cruelty. He was also more famous than most Kings of the Destroyed because of all this, too.\n\nBarr had once slain a Dragon Duke. Dragon One pursued him across a dozen systems in retaliation, but he managed to get away. While he was running away, he killed many Dragon Dukes and Marquises, too. That made the Dragon look really bad, and it gave Barr\u2019s notoriety an enormous boost.\n\nDragon One was a King, but he failed to chase down a Duke. And Barr had killed many of the Dragon. That was why he became famous.\n\nBarr saw Han Meng\u2019er\u2019s arrow come right for him, but the speed he used to approach had not changed. He did not use the bone knife slung behind his shoulder. Instead, he reached out his hand to grab the arrow."
