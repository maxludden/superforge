    "text": "The melting point of Planet King Kong\u2019s stone was very high, so the lava itself was incredibly hot.\n\nHan Sen was wearing his Galactic Lobster armor and had his Jadeskin firing on all cylinders. But even so, he still felt like his skin was being singed.\n\nFortunately, he could withstand the heat. With hesitating, he dove deep into the lava.\n\nThe lava wasn\u2019t transparent like water, so his eyes were useless once he was under the surface. Instead, he had to use his Dongxuan Aura to examine his surroundings.\n\nThe stream of lava was far vaster than he had expected from the surface. After swimming down for a while, Han Sen still hadn\u2019t located the injured blue metal wolf. He couldn\u2019t see the far reaches of the lava, either. It was like he was lost in the middle of an endless sea.\n\nHan Sen frowned, but after a minute, the Dongxuan Aura detected a creature swimming through the lava nearby.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t just one. Han Sen quickly realized that there were many xenogeneics swimming through the lava.\n\nHe was surrounded by rock dragons that were at least one hundred meters long. They were all playing together in the lava.\n\nHan Sen could feel their presences in frightening detail. They were all King class, at least, and there were many of them. Han Sen sensed at least a dozen.\n\nFortunately, the rock dragons didn\u2019t seem interested in Han Sen. Perhaps he was too small, and he was thus unable to snare their attention.\n\nA thousand-meter-long rock dragon swam smoothly past Han Sen, and he decided to jump onto that stone body like a little lizard. He latched onto the rock dragon\u2019s skin and let it carry him forward.\n\nIn that endless lava sea, finding an injured blue metal wolf no longer seemed like a realistic goal. However, if the rock dragon horde wasn\u2019t hostile, then using a rock dragon to look around seemed like a good idea.\n\nThe rock dragon swam through the lava for a while, and eventually it dove deeper into the sea of lava.\n\nThe temperature rose around them, and Han Sen felt as if his skin was burning. Fortunately, the scales of the rock dragon were cool. They weren\u2019t changing in accordance with the temperature of the lava, and pressing himself against them made Han Sen feel a whole lot better.\n\nThere were many xenogeneics in that lava sea. They were all either fire or rock elementals, but when they encountered the dragon horde, they all moved aside. None of the creatures wanted to start a fight with the dragons.\n\nBut still, there seemed to be no sign of the blue metal wolf anywhere. It made Han Sen wonder. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t suitable for the blue metal wolf. Why would he come here?\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen mulled over the question, he suddenly felt a wave of pressure sweep over him. And then, that burning sensation quickly disappeared.\n\nHan Sen noticed that all the lava was gone. He opened his eyes and what he saw shocked him.\n\nThe burning lava was being held aloft by some invisible power. It created a sky of lava, and below the lava sky was a dreamy-looking island. There were pools, mountains, flowers, and trees there. White clouds hung all around it. It looked like a slice of heaven.\n\nA lake lay in the middle of that island, steaming like a giant hot spring. The blue metal wolf was having a bath inside the lake. It looked very tired, as if coming to the island had been a much-needed vacation.\n\nThe rock dragons were now flying around the island. They wanted to enter the lake as well, but they appeared to be too afraid. Instead, they kept roaring at the metal wolf.\n\nThe blue metal wolf continued its bath contentedly, ignoring the noisy dragons.\n\nHan Sen could see that the wounds of the blue metal wolf were almost healed. After the days it had spent in the lake, it seemed almost completely restored to health.\n\n\u201cCan the water of that lake heal things?\u201d Han Sen looked at that lake.\n\nThe lake looked very clear, and he could see the spring water bubbling up at its center. The steamy air was rising, but he couldn\u2019t detect anything particularly special about it.\n\nThe lake was surrounded by mountains, trees, and vines. Some flowers were opening between the clouds. If it wasn\u2019t for the lava sky, it would have looked like some sort of holiday resort.\n\nPerhaps the rock dragons finally succeeded in annoying the wolf, because the creature stood up from the lake and roared back at them.\n\nThe rock dragons looked all shocked, and they surged back up toward the lava sky. They left the weird island below the lava.\n\nAs Han Sen considered the island, he concluded that the island might have been where the rock dragons lived. The blue metal wolf seemed to have taken it away from them. Perhaps that was why they were forced to leave.\n\nAnd the blue metal wolf might have just been using the lake on the island to heal itself.\n\nHan Sen was disappointed. The blue metal wolf\u2019s wounds had almost healed. Even the King class rock dragons were now scared of the beast, so Han Sen stood no chance.\n\nHan Sen released his hold on the rock dragon\u2019s body and dived out of the lava sea. He wanted to return to the valley so he could go back to slaying xenogeneics.\n\nHan Sen followed the winding path of the valley. After walking a thousand miles, he found a few more Rock Demons. He killed them and obtained their xenogeneic genes, but he still hadn\u2019t received one of their beast souls.\n\nSuddenly, he saw a shadow drop from the sky. It broke the atmosphere, heading straight for Han Sen.\n\nUpon seeing the shadow, Han Sen\u2019s face paled. He turned around with the intent to leave immediately, but that shadow was far too quick. It landed directly in front of Han Sen to bar his way.\n\n\u201cWhat? You are leaving so soon after seeing me? Do you not like me?\u201d That shadow was a beautiful female guard. She smiled at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cGuard Red Sleeve, I have only met you once. I simply didn\u2019t recognize you. How could I possibly not like you? I\u2019m just in a hurry to hunt xenogeneics. If there is nothing else you desire, then I must go.\u201d Han Sen turned around and started to leave.\n\nRed Sleeve smiled and said, \u201cMy good little brother, in the King\u2019s Garden, I believe you recognized your big sister, correct? Why would you say that?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shivered and forced a wry smile. He knew he couldn\u2019t hide anymore. He turned around to face Red Sleeve, and her body had already changed. She had snow-white ears and a fox\u2019s tail. Her face had transformed into one that Han Sen knew very well. It was Fox Queen.\n\n\u201cI see that my sister\u2019s face looks the same as ever. You still look so pretty. I am so happy to see you.\u201d Han Sen smiled, but his mind was in a rush about how to escape.\n\nFox Queen was bold enough to disguise herself as one of the Extreme King and get close to Prince Fourteen in the process. She must have planned something big. Now that Han Sen had learned that she was among them, there was no way she would be willing to leave him alive.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t shown that he recognized her before, hoping that she wouldn\u2019t realize he had recognized her. He thought it would take a while for her to find out that he had discovered her secret, and so he hadn\u2019t expected her to come for him so soon."
