    "text": "Han Sen was very eager to keep reading it. He continued reading what was in the back of the notebook. He wanted to learn more and find out what the black-crystal stone was.\n\nBai Mo had mentioned that the black-crystal stone could open the tunnel between two worlds. Qin Xiu might have made use of the black-crystal stone to enter the geno universe.\n\n\u201cIf things were like that, then that is a fair explanation. If Qin Wan\u2019er was born in another world, the Wan\u2019er in this world would have been impossible for him to revive. It would have been useless no matter what Qin Xiu attempted. That is unless he accessed another world and found a Qin Wan\u2019er that was born there and brought her back.\u201d Han Sen had figured out why Qin Xiu went to the geno universe.\n\nAlthough life worked in a cycle, a person never really died. On the other hand, reincarnation did not mean the same person was alive beyond the veil.\n\nWithout the feelings and memories of a past life, even if she was still alive, the Qin Wanler from that life and the Wan\u2019er from the other life would have had no shared connection.\n\nTo Qin Xiu, the Wan\u2019er he had found was just a Wan\u2019er that was a Witch. That was not his real sister, Wan\u2019er.\n\nThe reason Qin Xiu wanted to take Wanler back was so she could combine with the body of her past life and recover her memories. To do that, he needed to open the path between the two worlds. The geno hall prevented that from occurring. So, Qin Xiu had to break the geno hall and bring Wan\u2019er back. \u201cIf Qin Xiu really used the black-crystal stone to go to the geno universe, he should have been able to use the black-crystal stone to bring Wan\u2019er back. There was no reason he had to stir up as much trouble as he did. If I get that black crystal, that would be the relic Bai Mo described. Why did it appear in the first sanctuary in the sanctuaries? Why was it not in Qin Xiu\u2019s hands? It was such an important item. With Qin Xiu\u2019s powers and planning, there was no way he would have lost it. Have I analyzed this all incorrectly? Who knows? Maybe something happened.\u201d Han Sen thought about all of this for a long time, but he could not get the answers he sought.\n\nThe content in the back of Bai Mo\u2019s notebook detailed what occurred after he found the old faction\u2019s relic and the ruins. Because the original star was destroyed, that old faction no longer existed now. Bai Mo tried everything he could to find out more about it.\n\nMaybe they were blessed, and Bai Mo found a lead. Although he could not find the leader of that old faction, it enabled him to find the relic and stone stove. Inside the stone stove, there had been a weird skill. It was the older version of The Story of Genes.\n\nBai Mo had given the relic and The Story of Genes that had been copied to Qin Xiu, who approved him to research it even further. Although he did not find out the secrets of The Story of Genes, they found out the use of the relic.\n\nAccording to the notebook, in the end, Qin Xiu was in Ancient Big God Mountain. He used the relic to enter Bai Mo\u2019s antimaterial world. It was the universe Han Sen had been born in.\n\nAfter Qin Xiu left, Bai Mo continued to research The Story of Genes, but it was very slow going with almost zero progress.\n\nThe notebook ended there. Bai Mo no longer wrote about himself, and he had not written anything about why the stone stove contained the egg of a gold-winged peacock.\n\nRegarding Mo Li\u2019s two gene races, whether their presence there was a coincidence or not, it was still a mystery that Han Sen was unable to shine a light on.\n\n\u201cThis is very bad. Qin Xiu used the black-crystal stone to reach the geno universe. Although the black-crystal stone turned into a black-crystal armor in my Sea of Soul, that was beyond my control. It pulled me here, so using it to take me back is likely impossible.\u201d Han Sen stared into the Sea of Soul and observed the black-crystal armor. It was unmoving, just hanging where it always was. Although he felt the black crystal armor, because he practiced The Story of Genes, it made him have a special connection to the black-crystal armor.\n\n\u201cBoss! What do you want? Say something. I am a man with a wife and kids. I want to go and see her. Give me a holiday. Let me go home for two days or perhaps even just one day.\u201d Han Sen whispered to the black-crystal armor. He was almost kneeling, but the black-crystal armor did not react. It was still dead, lying where it was.\n\nIf he was able to drag the black-crystal armor out of him, Han Sen would do just that and beat up the black-crystal armor with all his might. But he was unable to control the black-crystal armor.\n\n\u201cBai Mo\u2019s notebook said the relic can fasten the evolution of a gene race. It enables the juveniles to level up fast. In a very short amount of time, it can become an adult. It is even possible to accelerate their development into an ultimate mode. It can also make a low-rank gene race mutate into a higher rank. This function is similar to the black-crystal stone in the sanctuaries. Now, it is a set of armor. Those abilities are useless now.\u201d After thinking about that, Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide. An evil smile crossed his lips. \u201cYou broken piece of armor! You are trying to trick me. Do you think I cannot deal with you?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes looked bright. He was making commands to the gold-winged peacock king in the Sea of Souls.\n\nAfter the gold-winged peacock king received Han Sen\u2019s command, it made a very light scream. It flapped its wings and flew over to the black-crystal armor. It opened its bird beak. Its maw suddenly grew bigger. It swallowed the black-crystal armor.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how long you can stay there for. If possible, try not to make a sound,\u201d Han Sen madly thought. He watched the gold-winged peacock king, which had just eaten the black-crystal armor.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen saw the gold-winged peacock king glow with gold light. Some light came out of its body. It was like silk. It wrapped up his body and quickly formed a giant golden egg. It trapped him inside.\n\nBy this time, Han Sen had researched the information of quite a few gene races. He knew this gold-winged peacock was becoming an adult.\n\n\u201cDoes the black-crystal stone\u2019s function still work?\u201d Han Sen had a weird look on his face. He thought the black-crystal armor would fight back, but it did not fight back in the least. It let the gold-winged peacock king use its powers to transform.\n\nThe gold-winged peacock transformation was something that could be completed in a short amount of time. Han Sen watched it for half a day. The gold egg had yet to display any sort of movement. By then, the ship had docked on Turin Planet.\n\nMister Yang and Li Bing Yu came looking for Han Sen. The three of them said goodbye to the crew of the ship and hopped off.\n\n\u201cBai Mo said Qin Wan\u2019er\u2019s body was sealed in a mysterious place in the Qin Kingdom\u2019s palace. It was Qin Xiu that did it. If Qin Wan\u2019er really did go through a reverse tunnel as I did, and if that is true, I will have to go to the capital of the Qin Kingdom.\u201d Han Sen thought of that possibility.\n\nWhile Han Sen was deep in thought, he suddenly heard the crack of a whip and some nasty voices. \u201cStop playing dead. Get moving.\u201d A noble guard was holding a thunder whip. He used it to keep striking the people that came off the ship. Those people were all dressed in tattered clothing. Most of them looked injured. They cried awfully loud when they were hit.\n\nHan Sen noticed that the ship they had been on was used for human trafficking. \u201cFor such a developed kingdom, how can there be slavery?\u201d Han Sen frowned."
