    "text": "\u201cWhat are you digging?\u201d Han Sen wondered. He knew that he couldn\u2019t steal whatever it was from the Nine-Life Cat, as ten thousand fitness wasn\u2019t much in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t use his geno armor in the sanctuaries, so he knew he\u2019d be unable to beat the Nine-Life Cat. Fortunately, he still had Destiny\u2019s Tower, and that meant he wasn\u2019t afraid.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s something good in there, I just don\u2019t know what it is. If you help, I\u2019ll count you in for a share of the profits,\u201d Nine-Life Cat said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what it is that\u2019s in there, how do you know it\u2019s something good you can profit from?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe him.\n\n\u201cTeehee. You should know a bit about this. This is God\u2019s Ruin, but it is a crystallizer ruin, also. I know there is something about the crystallizers here, and we\u2019ll find out what it is exactly when we\u2019ve dug it out,\u201d Nine-Life Cat said.\n\nNow Han Sen knew this was God\u2019s Ruin, and it was no wonder why it looked strange.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s dig it out together. Count me in for that share of the treasure.\u201d After that, Han Sen started digging out the grave alongside Nine-Life Cat Then, he thought to himself, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know I would be here. He wouldn\u2019t count me in if I wasn\u2019t here. We don\u2019t have a grudge, but there\u2019s surely no chance he\u2019d want to harm me, right?\u201d\n\nThey both kept on digging into the grave that looked like a little mound of soil. It was very solid. All of Han Sen\u2019s fitness, with the use of Taia, could only allow him to shovel just a tiny bit of soil.\n\nThe soil was like steel, and it was incredibly difficult for them to dig through. After digging only a meter, Han Sen was sweating through his clothes.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with this soil. There can\u2019t be treasure inside, surely.\u201d Han Sen spoke as he continued digging.\n\nNine-Life Cat said, \u201cThis is the crystallizer\u2019s crystal soil. It\u2019s composed of crystallizer material rendered into dirt. It\u2019s all fairly useless.\u201d\n\nHan Sen kept on digging and asked, \u201cHow do you know something good resides in here? There are lots of graves here, all identical. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything outstanding about this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! I know because I am the Nine-Life Cat. Keep digging. Something must be in here.\u201d Nine-Life Cat smiled.\n\nAfter digging for a while, Han Sen felt as if something was wrong. Soon, he started to hear a strange noise.\n\nHe stopped and tried listening to it. He decided that the sound must have been the wind, as there was nothing remarkable about it.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, do you hear that noise?\u201d Han Sen asked the Nine-Life Cat.\n\n\u201cWhat noise?\u201d Nine-Life Cat perked his ears, but there was nothing. He went back to digging.\n\nHan Sen focused, and after not hearing anything more, he returned to the work at hand.\n\nAfter half a day, they had dug a two-meter-long hole that was three meters deep. Then, they finally found something.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had struck something hard. He brushed away the crystal dirt and found a portion of a big metal board.\n\nThe part that was revealed looked to have been made from silver. There were some words on it, too, but he couldn\u2019t read what was written. It wasn\u2019t the usual ancient human text that the crystallizers traditionally used.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Keep digging. Dig it out.\u201d Nine-Life Cat hurried Han Sen along when he froze.\n\nHan Sen followed the edges of the metal board and dug out its shape until he unearthed it all. It was a square-shaped silver board around forty centimeters long. It was full of text, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t discern a single word of it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how thick it was, as some of it was still beneath the soil. The visible portion was at least five centimeters thick. There was something there, but it wasn\u2019t anything unpleasant Han Sen felt much better, seeing this, so he kept on digging with renewed vigor.\n\nBut when he dug, he began to feel as if something was wrong. It wasn\u2019t actually a board. It was very long. Han Sen dug another half a meter, but he couldn\u2019t bring it all out\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what is this? It cannot be a coffin,\u201d Han Sen said thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coffin. The crystallizers didn\u2019t bury; that\u2019s something only humans do,\u201d Nine-Life Cat said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not a coffin, then what\u2019s in there? What is this?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cWho told you it might be a coffin?\u201d Nine-Life Cat said, rolling his eyes as he did.\n\n\u201cIf it is not a coffin, then what is this?\u201d Han Sen repeated.\n\n\u201cThis is the greenhouse of a crystallizer,\u201d Nine-Life Cat said.\n\n\u201cGreenhouse?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s jaw dropped.\n\nHan Sen had never expected some sort of greenhouse.\n\n\u201cStop asking stupid questions and keep digging,\u201d Nine-Life Cat said.\n\nThe metal board was very long. They dug four meters of it out, and they still weren\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working! It is almost out. Keep going!\u201d Nine-Life Cat used his paws to push the board, and it moved a little.\n\nHan Sen did not know what to say. They had been there for so long, it would have been terrible if they ultimately walked away empty-handed.\n\nAfter digging for another two hours, they managed to dig the entire board out. They stood it up against the wall of the cave they were in. The board was six meters long, forty centimeters wide, and forty centimeters high. There was a lot of text scrawled across it.\n\nHan Sen tried to carry it out, but he could not. Even using all his strength, he could barely lift the thing.\n\nHan Sen felt very strange. If Old Cat said that it was a greenhouse, then that might have meant all the graves were plants. They should have been digging out seeds, not a giant metal board, right?\n\nBut before Han Sen could get answers, he and Old Cat had to get it out of the hole. They both lifted it as if it were a heavy tree. They flew together and brought it out of the pit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s finally out!\u201d After they flew up out of the hole, Han Sen and Old Cat dropped it back on the ground. After wiping the sweat from his brow, Han Sen froze when he saw what was before him.\n\nFor some reason, there were many pairs of eyes looking back at them both."
