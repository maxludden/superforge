It shivered at his touch, like he was brushing against a dragon or a tiger.\n\nSwords had sword souls, and bows had a spirit of their own, too. The higher level it was, the harder it was for others to make use of it. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra powers to activate the treasure. He was able to make use of most treasures, but that was because most treasures didn\u2019t already have owners. This Wind String did have a master, and even with Han Sen using his Dongxuan Area powers, it resisted. He was unable to pull the string back.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fingers hooked onto that tender-looking string. Slowly, he cast his Jadeskin power. The fingers upon the string turned to ice, and the power he used became grander.\n\nBut that string still wouldn\u2019t budge. No matter how hard Han Sen tugged at the string, it refused to be drawn. It didn\u2019t look as if it was ever going to happen.\n\nAutumn Wind was delighted to see this. He said, \u201cMy Wind String has a mind of its own. Not just anyone can make use of it. Why don\u2019t you try using a different bow? I won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like my bows to be a little stubborn,\u201d Han Sen said inscrutably.\n\nAutumn Wind quietly said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind you trying, but you can\u2019t keep these two girls waiting for too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait. We can start right now. This is the first arrow,\u201d Han Sen said. Then he pulled an arrow out of the quiver.\n\nHan Sen felt comfortable when he held the arrow. There was a sensation that was difficult to describe. When he was in the sanctuaries, he had frequently used a bow. And he was always the best when it came to using them. When he was in the Blackhawk Military Academy, he came first place in an archery competition. Han Sen liked using bows.\n\nBut he had yet to find a bow that was strong enough in the geno universe, and when it came to ranged engagements, he could always make use of Spell\u2019s arsenal. He rarely used bows anymore.\n\nEven if he found a good bow beast soul, he would sooner give it to his daughter Han Meng\u2019er.\n\nHan Sen thought it would be a while before he had to make use of a bow again. He didn\u2019t expect he would have a chance to use his bow in this sort of situation.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to hold a bow again.\u201d Han Sen sighed. He lifted the arrow, pressing it against the string of Wind String.\n\n\u201cWhat is this guy hoping to achieve? He couldn\u2019t pull Wind String\u2019s string, so what is the point of putting an arrow on it? Is the arrow going to launch itself?\u201d Everyone thought what Han Sen was doing was so weird.\n\nEveryone could tell Han Sen didn\u2019t have enough power. He had pulled Wind String\u2019s string twice, and it wouldn\u2019t budge. It clearly couldn\u2019t be drawn.\n\nAutumn Wind put out his hands and said, \u201cActually, I really don\u2019t mind you making use of a different bow.\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored him. He raised the bow and the nocked arrow, and he cast Jadeskin. Then, he pulled back on Wind String\u2019s string.\n\nA scary power surged through Han Sen\u2019s fingers. He tugged on the string, but it was refusing to move. Han Sen was applying too much strength, though. He pulled so hard that the string dug into his fingers until it reached his fingerbones. It completely bypassed the protection of Jadeskin.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t force it. Even a deified elite might have trouble pulling the string of Wind String,\u201d Autumn Wind cautioned.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t heed his words. He continued to pull the string, as the power of his fingers became stronger.\n\n\u201cSir, run!\u201d While everyone\u2019s focus was on Han Sen, a Demon was frowning at Ji Yang Sheng, who was still hitched to the rickshaw.\n\nJi Yang Sheng pretended not to see him, but the Demon King who had called out to him was in a hurry. He didn\u2019t move forward to save Ji Yang Sheng, though. He was the only Demon there. The true Demon elites had yet to show up.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with the prince? Is he retarded? Why isn\u2019t he running?\u201d Demon King wondered.\n\nHan Sen was obviously focused on the bow right now, so the Demon had no idea why Ji Yang Sheng was refusing to run while he had the chance.\n\nThe Demon kept making signals to Ji Yang Sheng, the man\u2019s constant waving made the prince very angry. He turned his head away from the man. Inside, he was thinking, \u201cAre you stupid? Of course, I would run if I had the chance to. I wouldn\u2019t need a reminder from you. Han Sen is right next to me, and those two women can\u2019t be provoked. I can\u2019t risk trying to run away.\u201d\n\nThe Demon saw that Ji Yang Sheng was now refusing to look his way. So, he moved around the crowd, getting back into Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s line of sight. Once he was sure the prince could see him, he started signaling again.\n\nJi Yang Sheng eyebrows were lowered in a deep frown. He wanted to slap that brain-damaged Demon. He wasn\u2019t going to run away now. If he started to run, the two women Han Sen had with him would believe he was trying to escape. It would look very bad if he was captured once again, and this time in front of a large audience.\n\nJi Yang Sheng ignored the idiotic Demon and closed his eyes.\n\nEveryone could see Han Sen was using all of his strength, even though the string was digging into his flesh. He was still unable to draw the bow, and that made them happy.\n\n\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re the Daddy of all Gods? Even if you were, that is a bow. You\u2019re the God\u2019s Daddy, not the Bow\u2019s Daddy. Why are you insisting on wrestling with this bow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis ego\u2019s gone out of control. He experienced a big fight and is now confident he can do everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! I can finally witness Han Sen make a fool of himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWind String isn\u2019t that easy to operate. If it was that easy, it wouldn\u2019t belong to the Aichi.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nAs everyone discussed the bow, Han Sen\u2019s eyes hardened. A robe of grey feathers appeared around him, giving off a rainbow light.\n\nThe crowd of onlookers could see the rainbow glow coming from Han Sen, but they couldn\u2019t make out the details of the robe or the symbol that had appeared on Han Sen\u2019s back. The peacock had already spread its tail. The glory of its light surrounded Han Sen.\n\nOnce Han Sen received the peacock king\u2019s buff, his Jadeskin fingers glowed like a rainbow. The power running through his hands surged to a truly horrifying level.\n\nAs that scary power rose through Han Sen, Wind String finally began to move. Inch by inch, the bow was being drawn. The dragon-like tendon-string was quivering madly. It made the sound of some ancient predator roaring. It sounded like a thunderstorm. People nearby thought that their eardrums were about to pop.\n\nEveryone in the crowd felt this way. They stared, dumbfounded, as Han Sen pulled Wing String\u2019s string back. They were too shocked to say anything.\n\nWind String could be drawn by force. Just like the Bona generals, who had been half-deified and focused on pure strength. With the combination of their strength, their powers reached a deified level and pulled back Wind String\u2019s string. They had only done so once, though.\n\nThings never turned out well for the people that forced back Wind String. There was a deified elite who once managed to pull back Wind String\u2019s string. After forcing it to obey his will, extremely bad luck fell upon him.\n\nEveryone could now see that Han Sen had managed to draw Wind String. As much as they were shocked, they were really happy about this.\n\nThey were surprised Han Sen was able to draw Wind String, and they were excited to find out whether or not bad luck would fall upon Han Sen like the others that made use of it."
