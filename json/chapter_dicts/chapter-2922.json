    "text": "The dragon head, horn, and beard all rose as the dragon moaned. Its voice pierced through the universe and space. It made the snow mountain and ice mountain collapse. The ice fields broke.\n\nHan Sen was hanging in space. He used all of his power with the Dongxuan Aura to suppress the dragon\u2019s cry. His body was shaken. He felt as if he would fall apart any second.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very powerful xenogeneic.\u201d Han Sen grabbed the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze and blocked the dragon\u2019s sprinting cry. He activated the image on the face of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. The pretty lady\u2019s eye had some weird, cold light. It landed on the black-scaled dragon.\n\nHan Sen wanted to strike first. He wanted the black-scaled dragon to freeze on the stone mountain.\n\nThe dragon\u2019s eyes were like bottomless black holes. It looked into the weird eyes of the Medusa. It looked like two black holes were creating a vortex that sucked the Medusa\u2019s eyes into them. The body of the creature did not get frozen.\n\nHan Sen wanted to start the Medusa\u2019s Gaze again because the black-scaled dragon\u2019s eyes could absorb the staring light. Other bodies would not have been able to block the light.\n\nBefore Han Sen activated the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, the black-scaled dragon\u2019s head raised. Its body kicked up a black cloud of smoke. The dragon\u2019s mouth opened and spat something out.\n\nHan Sen had the traditional culture\u2019s effect. He thought the black dragon would be spitting out some dragon ball to play with him, but the dragon\u2019s mouth did not spit out a dragon ball. It was a lantern.\n\nIt was a black stone lantern. Based on its appearance, it looked like a geno hall race lantern. But the lantern did not have a race mark. The lantern was burning with a fire that possessed a holy white color.\n\nThe white flame was glowing brightly. It made the old stone lantern more mysterious and serious.\n\nHan Sen instantly reacted. When the big goldfish described the treasure, it mentioned something about stone and fire. Han Sen had no idea what that meant. Now that he saw the stone lantern, he realized what it was.\n\n\u201cThe treasure the big goldfish spoke about was this lantern, but the stone lantern is inside the dragon\u2019s mouth. Even if I close my eyes and walked there, how was I supposed to retrieve the lantern from the dragon\u2019s mouth?\u201d Han Sen did not understand, but things were already in motion. He could not waste time thinking about things like that. To freely collect the stone lantern, he needed to kill this xenogeneic. Afterward, he would get the black-scaled dragon\u2019s xenogeneic genes. That was like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nHan Sen thought about that before doing anything.\n\nThe stone lantern flew out of the dragon\u2019s mouth. The black-scaled dragon reached a claw out. It put the stone lantern in front of its dragon mouth and blew fire into it.\n\nAs the black dragon presence went through the flame, it turned white. It was like a tide going for Han Sen.\n\nThe dragon presence covered the entire area. Unless Han Sen risked teleporting to unknown space, he could not evade that scary dragon presence.\n\nHan Sen gathered up all his power. He held Bao\u2019er and placed her behind the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. He used the shield to block the dragon presence that came with the lantern fire.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt a scary power strike his shield. His arm almost broke. The shield hit his body, which sent him flying. He flew through space for what seemed like forever. As the dragon presence messed with his senses, he kept his body tight to stabilize himself.\n\nHan Sen felt as if his body had been shattered, but he still had the shield in his hands. He was shocked. The surface of the shield was burning with a holy white flame. It was just like the flame on the stone lantern.\n\nThe white flame had no heat, so it did not burn the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. The white flame was quickly spreading across the shield. It seemed as if it was going to be devoured in no time at all.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan powers. He tried to put out the fire on the shield, but he could not stop it. He watched the shield become surrounded by a white flame. He did not want it to spread onto his hands, so he had to let the shield go.\n\nAs Han Sen let go of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, the shield was surrounded by white flame. The purple, metal-looking shield looked like it was surrounded by a holy white flame. It actually looked kind of looked holy.\n\nThe black-scaled big dragon\u2019s talons suddenly moved. Han Still did not have complete control of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. It was flying toward the black-scaled dragon. Once it got closer, the dragon grabbed it with its talons.\n\nHan Sen saw that the big dragon\u2019s eyes were full of disdain. With the talons wrapped around the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, the weird woman on the front opened her eyes. She fired out a weird light.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face suddenly changed.\n\nThe Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze was not normally something a stranger could take and use, but the black-scaled dragon was somehow able to do so. That was a bit difficult to believe.\n\nThe Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze could only be used by the Gana\u2019s special element power. Han Sen used the Dongxuan Sutra to simulate Gana powers. That was how he was able to make use of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze.\n\nThe black-scaled snake dragon had a different element from the Gana. Han Sen was certain about that. So, how was it able to activate the shield?\n\nTime did not grant Han Sen the chance to think about it too much. Seeing the Medusa\u2019s Gaze light about to land on him, he flashed away. He teleported out to dodge the light emitted by the shield.\n\nHan Sen understood the Medusa\u2019s Gaze quite well. The black-scaled dragon kept on firing Medusa\u2019s Gaze like bullets. All of those Me kept being launched, but not a single one was able to harm Han Sen.\n\nNow, Han Sen\u2019s teleport skill could have him teleport away in the galaxy. The Medusa\u2019s Gaze light could not keep up with his teleportation speed.\n\nThe black-scaled dragon continuously attacked and repeatedly failed. It seemed to lose patience. It opened its mouth wide and spat out some dragon presence. This time, the dragon presence did not go through the stone lantern\u2019s flame. It was like a black cloud covering the sky and ground. It did not allow Han Sen to move.\n\nHan Sen looked at it. There were waving watermarks on his body. The dragon\u2019s presence covered the sky and earth. It looked extremely murderous, but it could not get close to Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nHis Time Ghost beast soul delayed time in the area. It made the dragon presence unable to reach Han Sen."
