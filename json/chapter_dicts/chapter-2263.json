    "text": "As the sword-like weapon was slowly removed, the mysterious symbols on its surface began to leap and dance like mad. It looked as if countless fairies of silver thunder were dancing across it.\n\nThe silver lightning still crackled out of the sword. It was like there was a silver dragon now flying around the cavern.\n\nBecause the lightning was too strong, Han Sen had to fall back and away from the black kirin\u2019s corpse. Even the blood kirin itself stumbled back.\n\nThe blood kirin was looking very excited. It kept retreating, but its eyes never left the black kirin\u2019s body.\n\nLittle Silver\u2019s lightning was growing to frightening strength. The hilt of the sword was firmly in the grip of its maw. It forced the sword completely out of the black kirin\u2019s body.\n\nThe sword was only one and a half meters long, but its shape was very strange. The blade was split into three sections, and each of its points was sharp. It looked like an army spear.\n\nAs he watched the lightning springing from the blade, Han Sen could immediately tell that the weapon was profoundly special. It might have been a deified weapon.\n\nDong! Dong!\n\nLittle Silver leaped off of the black kirin\u2019s back. It loosened its grip on the handle and let the silver sword clatter to the ground. Then Little Silver let its powerful lightning fox form dissipate.\n\nAlthough Little Silver didn\u2019t seem to be injured, it did look exhausted.\n\nHan Sen quickly picked up Little Silver and offered him one of the blood pears. Little Silver shook his head at the fruit and lay down on Han Sen\u2019s chest instead. It closed its eyes, looking very, very tired.\n\nUpon seeing the silver sword come free of the dead creature, the blood kirin leaped towards the black kirin\u2019s corpse with exuberant joy.\n\n\u201cWhat a sweet creature. All it wanted was for its mother to rest in peace. It\u2019s rare that I get to see something this touching.\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide. The blood kirin ran over to the black kirin\u2019s body and used its teeth to rip off a chunk. The blood kirin tore into the corpse, eating ravenously.\n\nThe blood kirin used its claws to tear the body apart, and viscera and gore flew everywhere as it feasted.\n\nHan Sen froze for a while, his face growing a little pale. His initial assumpted seemed to have been very wrong. He didn\u2019t know anymore if the black kirin was indeed the blood kirin\u2019s mother. If it was, the blood kirin really was a monster.\n\nBut that sort of made sense. The blood kirin was born from a dead body. It had spent its life consuming the White Bone Hell\u2019s blood bone air. Its very existence had come from death and cruelty. Eating the corpse of its own mother to gain strength wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility.\n\nIt was still an incredibly heartless act, though.\n\nHan Sen was planning to put Bao\u2019er and Little Silver back inside Destiny\u2019s Tower. If the blood kirin went mad after consuming the black kirin, they would have to run.\n\nBefore he could grab her, Bao\u2019er ran over to the silver sword. She reached her hand out to grab it before Han Sen could shout a warning.\n\nWhen Bao\u2019er\u2019s came down upon it, the blade no longer released that silver lightning. Bao\u2019er dragged the sword back over to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDad! This sword is awesome. We should take it with us.\u201d Bao\u2019er held the sword out to Han Sen as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t dare take the sword, though. Just because Bao\u2019er hadn\u2019t been electrified, that didn\u2019t guarantee that Han Sen wouldn\u2019t get shocked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Dad! It is fine now. The blade isn\u2019t dangerous anymore.\u201d Bao\u2019er winked.\n\n\u201cPfft, why would Dad be afraid? I\u2019m not scared; I\u2019m just cautious. This is the behavior of a mature man.\u201d Han Sen blushed. He reached out to take the silver sword.\n\nJust as Bao\u2019er had told him, the sword didn\u2019t crackle with lightning when he touched it. It really did behave like an ordinary weapon now.\n\n\u201cWeird. Why has the sword become normal after leaving the black kirin\u2019s body?\u201d Han Sen looked at the blood kirin still gorging on the black kirin. He then thought of something. \u201cMaybe the black kirin\u2019s body triggered the power of the sword? Maybe that is why it remained active. The electricity kept the blood kirin from eating the black kirin. It had to have the sword removed first.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if his guesses were correct, but it didn\u2019t matter anymore. Han Sen went to check out the sword. The symbols of thunder across it were delightful to see. They made the sword look absolutely beautiful. It didn\u2019t even look like a weapon; it looked like an art-piece wrought in silver.\n\nAfter witnessing its power, Han Sen agreed with Bao\u2019er. He couldn\u2019t tell what level it was, but he was fairly sure that it had to be a deified weapon.\n\nWhen he looked at the blade more closely, he noticed that a few words were engraved on the back of the sword. He was able to read them. It was of the common language in the geno universe, and it said, \u201cThunder God Spike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that must be its real name.\u201d Han Sen raised the weapon carefully in front of him. He tried to put his own power into the Thunder God Spike, in order to trigger the weapon\u2019s power. Unfortunately, he could not get it to work.\n\nNo matter what power or skill he used, nothing could trigger the lightning of the Thunder God Spike.\n\nHan Sen decided to use the Dongxuan Sutra to simulate Little Silver\u2019s lightning power, then he focused that power on the Thunder God Spike. The lightning symbols of the Thunder God Spike began to move. They were like silver snakes running up and down the blade.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra was merely Marquise class, so the lightning power he could simulate wouldn\u2019t be that strong. Only a small amount of the Thunder God Spike\u2019s power was summoned, but even so, it was already very strong. It was stronger than if Han Sen used all of his power with Jadeskin.\n\n\u201cThis thing is definitely a deified weapon!\u201d Han Sen felt so happy. The Thunder God Spike didn\u2019t hurt him when he activated it, either. That meant he could use the weapon in combat.\n\nHan Sen put the Thunder God Spike into Destiny\u2019s Tower, and thankfully, it didn\u2019t resist like the Jade Drum had. The Jade Drum was a living creature, but the Thunder God Spike was just a weapon.\n\nHan Sen was very lucky to have found the weapon, but it would be dangerous for him to carry a deified treasure in plain view. Unless it was direly necessary, Han Sen planned to keep the weapon hidden from anyone who might want to steal it.\n\nHan Sen put Bao\u2019er and Little Silver back into Destiny\u2019s Tower. The blood kirin was still eating the black kirin\u2019s body. It was a small creature, but its stomach was large. The black kirin\u2019s body was like a mountain, but a big chunk of it had already disappeared.\n\nThe blood kirin ate its fill and grunted in satisfaction. Then it moved back and made a rumbling noise to get Han Sen\u2019s attention. It tossed its head at the black kirin\u2019s body, as if it was inviting Han Sen to eat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can eat it.\u201d Han Sen shook his head. His body was already filled with unprocessed Ghost Bone power, so it didn\u2019t matter what he ate right now.\n\nBut the blood kirin\u2019s invitation was still reassuring. The beast didn\u2019t seem like it was ever going to be hostile to him."
