The blue lightning enveloped him, increasing his power and speed. Whenever he struck an enemy, they\u2019d become paralyzed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good!\u201d Han Sen was delighted with the results. Although it wasn\u2019t a berserk beast soul, and it hadn\u2019t opened its tenth gene lock, Disloyal Knight was far stronger than it used to be. If it consumed more lifedrops and became a berserk beast soul, it\u2019d become as strong as Xie Qing King, Han Sen wagered.\n\nHan Sen summoned Golden Growler and put the lobster on its back. Then, they all returned to the shelter to have themselves a barbecue.\n\nHan Sen washed the lobster out and put the meat on the grill, as Bao\u2019er drooled uncontrollably. When they both sunk their teeth into the tantalizing-looking lobster meat, their faces turned sour as if they had taken a swig of curdled milk. It tasted awful.\n\nBut despite the fact that they couldn\u2019t enjoy it, all the others considered it a treat. Each and every other super creature had a bite, and they were loving it.\n\nGhost Eye and Snowball made sure to sit down in front of Han Sen and Bao\u2019er, stuffing their face with the lobster meat. They made squelching noises and let their lips hang to show how much they were enjoying the food, while those two could not.\n\nHan Sen then decided to pick up Bao\u2019er and return to the Alliance.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go eat some real food. We\u2019ll let them enjoy their dog food,\u201d Han Sen sternly said.\n\n\u201cWe need to eat something much better!\u201d Bao\u2019er affirmed.\n\n\u201cOf course! And for tonight, we\u2019re going to dine on the best food money can buy. Order whatever you want, Bao\u2019er, I\u2019m made of money!\u201d Han Sen kindly, albeit boastfully, proclaimed.\n\n\u201cMONEY!\u201d Bao\u2019er shouted in response, raising her fists in the air.\n\nHan Sen drove an aircraft to Roca Planet and went to the most expensive restaurant there. It was called Doria.\n\n\u201cSir, what would you like to eat, this fine evening?\u201d the waitress asked, while presenting a menu. Even Bao\u2019er was given one.\n\nIn this era, where proper labor practically did not exist, having real human staff just went to show how high-class the restaurant was.\n\n\u201cGive me your finest, madam. The best this place can provide, I\u2019ll take it!\u201d Han Sen proudly said.\n\nBao\u2019er, with a more serious tone of voice this time, just shouted, \u201cMONEY!\u201d\n\nThe waitress wasn\u2019t sure what to respond, as she had never encountered such a peculiar duo before.\n\nBut then, someone from behind mocked them out loud by saying, \u201cHas someone just won the lottery, and wants to flaunt his new-found, but bound to be short-lived wealth? Everyone here became rich before you did. Pah! The gall.\u201d\n\nHan Sen saw a middle-aged man sitting with a pretty woman. He was well-dressed, but his face left much to be desired. He looked at Han Sen with incredible disdain.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He didn\u2019t think they were speaking too loud, and the man obviously had a chip on his shoulder, to pick on total strangers. But Han Sen was the president\u2019s son-in-law, and he didn\u2019t want to make this a point and embarrass the president by beating him up.\n\nSo, Han Sen just picked up the menu and ordered a few portions of the most expensive food that was available.\n\nThe man heard what Han Sen ordered and said, \u201cStop pretending you are rich, dear boy! If you were that noble, go upstairs and eat amongst the nobles, dining on noble food.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned, hearing that voice again. He came here to spend a night relaxing in the comfort of fine dining. He hadn\u2019t expected that someone so wretchedly annoying would choose to pester him all evening.\n\nBao\u2019er didn\u2019t want to hold back her hatred of the man, though. The fire of murder blazed in her eyes, and she was now clutching her gourd. It was evident she did not like people bullying or complaining to Han Sen, and so she wanted to absorb the man.\n\nHan Sen noticed what she was going to do. With a racing heart, he had made sure to stop her. If something like that occurred, the Alliance would be thrown into shock and turmoil; particularly so, given Bao\u2019er\u2019s origin.\n\nWhen the waitress was about to confirm the order, an old man approached Han Sen.\n\n\u201cManager?\u201d The waitress thought she had done something wrong, and that was why he had stepped forward.\n\nThe wages for Doria employees were incredibly high, and she was given complimentary flesh in the First God\u2019s Sanctuary. The last thing she wanted was the loss of her job.\n\nThe old man smiled at the waitress and signaled for her to step back for a bit. Then, the manager turned to Han Sen and bowed. He said, \u201cDear Mister Han, we have prepared the top-floor garden exclusively for you. Chef Shirley will prepare the food for you, and only you. You will be given her undivided attention.\u201d\n\nA profound silence fell over the restaurant as everyone turned to look at them in shock.\n\nNo one could buy their way into the garden, but it provided unparalleled views of the city. Not even Sacred-Blood Aristocrats could get a seat there. And the last person who was able to get Chef Shirley to prepare their food was Jiang Bichen.\n\nEveryone looked at Han Sen in awe. They were in disbelief, seeing Doria provide such a worthy offering.\n\nWhen a few people recognized Han Sen for he was, one of them proclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s Han Sen! That\u2019s our first Super Aristocrat.\u201d\n\nHan Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and followed after the manager. He did not want to revel in the limelight and remain the focus of everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nThe man who had mocked Han Sen was glum, and a dire look had fallen upon his face. He rushed out of the restaurant without even finishing his meal.\n\nHan Sen took Bao\u2019er to the top floor, and there, he saw a beautiful woman in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Han Sen was shocked when he saw the woman."
