    "text": "Han Sen wished to spar with Ghost-Sword Prince for a while longer, but the snake had commanded his troops to commence an attack on the shelter.\n\nHan Sen opened his eighth gene lock, which made Taia gleam with a dark purple light and look like calcified blood.\n\nHe had managed to collect many sacred-geno points up to this point, so he\u2019d be able to last a while longer.\n\nTaia\u2019s blade swung right before Ghost-Sword\u2019s face.\n\nAnd then, with a sudden blaze of additional speed, Han Sen kicked things up a notch. His fierce blade accelerated, forcing Ghost-Sword to raise his greatsword and attempt a block.\n\nDong!\n\nBut the greatsword did nothing to repel Taia. In an instant, the mighty greatsword was broken. Taia continued its forward thrust, directly towards Ghost-Sword\u2019s chest.\n\nTaia was an incredibly strong sword, but its strength was determined by its wielder. If Han Sen wasn\u2019t half the man he was, the blade\u2019s strength would most likely have been similar to z-steel.\n\nIf you were a weak person, Taia would have been useless.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra imbued the blade with the power of blood, and it bolstered its strength by a huge degree. It lent it the mighty force that drove the current attack.\n\nGhost-Sword was too pompous to expect such a thing to occur, and so, it was too late for him to evade it.\n\nJust as this happened, the pigeon on the spirit\u2019s shoulder flashed with a green light. It flew down to shield its master\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cAwesome.\u201d Han Sen was made even happier. He had done all this for the sole purpose of killing that creature.\n\nBlood sprayed everywhere as the blade severed the bird\u2019s head from its neck.\n\n\u201cSacred-Blood Creature Green Falcon killed. No beast soul gained. Consume its flesh to gain zero to ten sacred geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nGhost-Sword\u2019s disposition only curdled after this, though. Enraged, he drew a longsword to replace his now-broken greatsword and attacked Han Sen madly.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body looked red, but he did not dodge the attack. Instead, he allowed the longsword to pierce directly into his chest.\n\nHe didn\u2019t fall, though. Instead, he looked cold, as if this had all been predicted beforehand. It was as if the entire fight had been calculated already. He dashed forward and brought himself directly in front of Ghost-Sword.\n\nThis scared Ghost-Sword. He had expected to be able to cut Han Sen in half, but instead, he felt his own head depart his body. In Han Sen\u2019s hand, droplets of a red substance dripped from Taia\u2019s blood-soaked blade.\n\nThe army that had accompanied Ghost-Sword all fled, as he was zapped back to his spirit stone.\n\nIn the manic scramble of creatures that were tripping over themselves to escape, Lin He and a few others ran out to nab a few easy kills. They had never been so happy.\n\nThey used to be terrified of fighting, and they had only just escaped the coming of a spirit that sought to conquer them and had, in fact, succeeded. It was a great relief to see victory achieved so easily.\n\nIn the past, it took a large amount of planning with a high volume of people to secure a win, but this was swift and only required the help of a few individuals. It was unbelievable.\n\nAt midnight, in Holy-Sword Shelter, a man pounded a stone door with one hand, hold a torch in the other.\n\nThe door opened, and the man went inside and closed it behind him.\n\n\u201cBrother Seven, why are you here?\u201d a bearded man asked.\n\nBrother Seven set the torch in a wall mount, and with much excitement, said, \u201cJunhao, Holy-Sword Emperor was just yelling at his son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one he proclaims to love so much?\u201d Qin Junhao asked.\n\n\u201cYes, that one. He failed in trying to reclaim his own shelter!\u201d Brother Seven said.\n\n\u201cWhich spirit was able to beat a spirit that has eight of his gene locks open?\u201d Qin Junhao wondered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even a spirit. It was a human. It was one of us!\u201d Brother Seven couldn\u2019t quell the giddy excitement that drenched his speech.\n\n\u201cAre you serious? How is such a thing possible?\u201d Qin Junhao\u2019s facial expression suggested that he was struggling to believe what he had just been told.\n\nBrother Seven, finally starting to get a grip on his composure, explained, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but this actually happened. I got the story from the horse\u2019s mouth; I heard Ghost-Sword talk about it himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good news, then. Finally, humanity seems to be accomplishing something in this place. I must tell you, though, this sounds like a person I\u2019d very much like to meet,\u201d Qin Junhao said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you say that, for I would very much like you to go meet with this person,\u201d Brother Seven said.\n\n\u201cHow can I even arrange such a meeting?\u201d Qin Junhao was stuck in this shelter, unable to leave.\n\n\u201cI have an idea, but they are probably unaware of Holy-Sword Emperor and what he is capable of. We have to warn this man, and the people that accompany him.\u201d Brother Seven paused, and then went on to say, \u201cHoly-Sword Emperor is on his way to Phoenix Desert. This is our window of opportunity to act. Now is the time we would do best to warn them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t leave,\u201d Qin Junhao said.\n\n\u201cI have a method, a way in which you can leave. But if you are caught, you will be in grave danger.\u201d Brother Seven now spoke with a tone of dark gravitas.\n\n\u201cDanger means nothing to me, if it enables me to warn others and possibly save them,\u201d Qin Junhao said with pride.\n\nBrother Seven nodded and went on to explain his plan, and then he said, \u201cI must accompany Holy-Sword Emperor. If you make it back to the Alliance, tell my wife I cannot return the favor.\u201d\n\nQin Junhao looked shocked, and asked, \u201cIs he going to Emperor Mountain?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he can go there now with the gift he was given.\u201d Brother Seven now possessed a wry smile.\n\nQIn Junhao quickly suggested, \u201cBrother Seven, come with me. Perhaps we can return to the Alliance together?\u201d\n\nBut Brother Seven shook his head and said, \u201cYou have to do this alone. You have a higher chance of making it by flying solo. If I come with you, they\u2019ll immediately come after me, and we\u2019ll both be killed.\u201d\n\nQin Junhao wished to say something, but Brother Seven interrupted him and said, \u201cWhen you find these people, tell them to return to the Alliance. Otherwise, they\u2019ll never be given the chance to again.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven provided a map to Qin Junhao and said, \u201cThis is a map I have drawn. I have worked on it for many years, and it is done from memory. It includes the location of God Mountain. If humanity ever goes for a full-blown war with spirits one day, this may be of great service.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven spoke as if he\u2019d be dying soon, and he gave many of his secret possessions to Qin Junhao."
