    "text": "Han Sen tried to simulate the energy flow of the little minks. He could do this by transforming the Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s power into the power the little minks possessed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be difficult to do, as the little minks had only just been born. But it actually took Han Sen seven or eight days to simulate their energy.\n\nAround this time, the little minks got hungry. They came out to eat again. After every meal, they returned to the red mist orb. They always tried to enter the red copper palace, but they failed each time.\n\nSeeing the little minks going back into the red mist orb, Han Sen finally finished simulating their powers. He then tried to put the new energy into the red mist orb.\n\nWhen the power hit the red mist orb, Han Sen felt the red mist orb respond, as if it had a weird power of its own. It sucked Han Sen right inside.\n\nDong!\n\nThe red mist orb fell on the floor, and Han Sen had entered it. He could see a lot of red mist, in addition to the big red copper palace.\n\nHan Sen walked through the mist and headed straight for that elusive palace. The seven minks kept on looping around the palace, unable to find an access point that would grant them entry.\n\nSeeing Han Sen, the seven little minks looked surprised. They surrounded Han Sen, jumping and screaming. They then ran for the main door.\n\nThey lined up. Some of them used their claws to push, some of them used their bellies to push, and some of them used their backs to push. They tried their hardest to push against the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nTzi! Tzi!\n\nThe little guys pushed so hard to no avail, then turned their attention to Han Sen to ask for his help.\n\nHan Sen had seen things like this many times before. If the seven minks wanted to enter that place so badly, there must be something valuable inside.\n\nHe didn\u2019t hesitate. He placed his hand against the door and pushed with the minks, trying to force it open.\n\nBut the door was like stone. Han Sen tried his best to get it to move, but it wouldn\u2019t budge an inch.\n\nHan Sen looked at the door and found no indication of a lock. He frowned.\n\n\u201cTzi! Tzi! Tzi! Tzi!\u201d The little minks kept pointing at something, trying to tell him something.\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Han Sen looked at them, but he could not speak their language. He couldn\u2019t understand them.\n\nLuckily, the Dongxuan Aura could allow him to read minds, at least a little. The minks kept on running and pointing, and eventually, he heard a sound. It was a simple sound, but Han Sen could guess what they meant.\n\nHan Sen tried pushing the door again, but this time, he used the little minks\u2019 power to do so. He was simulating them, yes, but he could still use the energy flow far better than the minks themselves could. When he pushed, the red copper door slowly opened.\n\nThe little minks were delighted. They lined up and helped Han Sen push.\n\nThe door was opening slowly, and when the opening reached one foot wide, the seven minks could not wait any longer. They hurriedly shuffled themselves inside. Han Sen couldn\u2019t wait either, and so he squeezed in through the gap. And on the inside, the palace really shocked Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen immediately noted how elegant the place had looked from the outside. It had led him to believe that it was some sort of ancient relic, but now that he was looking at the interior, the palace was shining with lights. It looked very scientific. It was different from what he was expecting.\n\nThe seven minks ran inside the palace as Han Sen followed. There were many strange tools and gizmos, and he felt as if he was entering the research quarters of some alien base.\n\nHan Sen saw there was a large throne inside the palace, though. There was a ten-meter-tall machine sitting on it, curiously enough. It looked like an old model of Alliance warframe. It was so old that it looked like a medieval knight. It was clad in heavy armor and everything.\n\nUpon further inspection, Han Sen realized that the knight did not have any electrical devices attached to it. It was built from what he assumed to be red copper. It sat on the throne, and it gave no indication of possessing a life force. Even so, it gave the threatening feeling that it could get up and fight whenever it wished to.\n\nThe seven little minks raced under its feet, then they climbed its copper body until they reached the heart. They pushed and squealed. What they were doing was anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nBoom!\n\nAmidst Han Sen\u2019s confusion and wonder, the knight did indeed stand up off the throne. It lurched to its feet with a jerking movement and shook the minks off of its body.\n\nIn the knight\u2019s empty eyes, a red light started to gleam. The light looked like some sort of warning beacon. Near the knight\u2019s heart, the red light grew stronger. It fired a red light towards the red minks, and all seven of them disappeared.\n\nAnd then, Han Sen saw the knight start to move. It was approaching him quickly. Its red copper body gave off a sense of foreboding.\n\nAnd shortly after, it was right next to Han Sen. It reached out its big hand and tried to pick Han Sen up.\n\nHan Sen frowned, and so he quickly retreated and evaded the hand\u2019s grip. But the armored knight bent its legs and unleashed a horrible power. It suddenly accelerated forward and ran before Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He used the Jadeskin\u2019s godlight to punch against the knight\u2019s hand. A metal noise rang out following the collision, but the knight was not hurt. Han Sen\u2019s hand, however, was left feeling numb.\n\nHan Sen summoned his rabbit shoes and evaded the knight\u2019s hand that was coming for him again. He thought the armored knight could not catch up with him.\n\nBut the knight\u2019s speed increased again, and it actually revealed itself to be faster than the rabbit shoes. It caught up with Han Sen way too quickly, and Han Sen was unable to dodge. It simply grabbed Han Sen\u2019s body as easily as one would a doll.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, but it was then that he realized the knight\u2019s hand was not exerting force. It put Han Sen in its palm and did not hurt him.\n\nThe knight\u2019s hand moved near its heart. That was where the little minks had been sucked into.\n\nHan Sen simulated the power of the little minks and then placed his hand against the knight\u2019s heart. Quickly, the knight\u2019s heart lit up again. The light shone on Han Sen, drawing him in."
