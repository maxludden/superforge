    "text": "Back in Space Garden, Han Sen had been troubled by the situation.\n\nAlthough he was able to use Han Sen\u2019s identity to reject the proposal, Han Sen had tried his hardest to save Golden Growler. This was a good opportunity. If he rejected the offer, Bai King might grow suspicious. Although Dollar and Han Sen\u2019s looked different, ordinary people would not suspect them as being the same. Unfortunately, people like Bai King knew Dollar was the Holy Baby. If Dollar and Han Sen were not able to show up at the same time, he could start thinking things weren\u2019t the way he presumed them to be.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThis is far too troublesome for me, but I have no choice. I have to decline the offer.\u201d He was not able to think of an adequate solution.\n\nIf he waited any longer for other humans and spirits to develop, by the time he was true god, he could find someone else to disguise themselves as him. Right now, that was too difficult.\n\nBzzt! Bzzt!\n\nWhile Han Sen was thinking, he heard a buzzing noise. It was like something was rapidly flapping its wings next to his ears. He looked closer. He did not know when it had appeared, but there was a small bee next to him.\n\nHan Sen thought it was weird. How was a xenogeneic bee able to fly there? Where he lived had the protection of a bai sema. A xenogeneic of that level could not bypass the bai sema.\n\nPang!\n\nThe little bee turned into smoke, and a beautiful little girl fell out. She fell right into Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\nHan Sen discovered it was Bao\u2019er who had fallen out. \u201cBao\u2019er!\u201d She was wearing a big pair of sunglasses.\n\nBao\u2019er was clinging to Han Sen\u2019s neck. She laughed and asked, \u201cDad, where have you been lately? Why don\u2019t you play with Bao\u2019er anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have recently\u2026\u201d Han Sen thought of something. He slapped his legs and switched the topic of conversation. \u201cHow could I forget about the sunglasses?\u201d\n\nIn the next moment, Han Sen developed rabid excitement. He quickly picked up Bao\u2019er and asked, \u201cBao\u2019er, can you use these glasses to look like Dad?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er tilted her head with confusion as she asked, \u201cI can, but why would I want to look like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cJust quickly tell me how long you can become me for.\u201d\n\nOne\n\nBao\u2019er thought for a moment and said, \u201cYour body of energy is strong. If I want to become you, it will cost me a lot of power. It will last around one hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hour? That is almost enough.\u201d Han Sen was quiet a moment and then said, \u201cTry becoming Dad now.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er was very nice. She used her sunglasses to scan Han Sen. Not long after, she successfully turned into Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCan you use this?\u201d Han Sen reached out his hand. His hand had the flame of the Xuan Yellow Sutra.\n\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Bao\u2019er reached out her hand. Her hand was just like his. She had the Xuan Yellow Sutra\u2019s flame.\n\nHan Sen was very happy. He used a few geno arts. He soon found out the geno arts Bao\u2019er could use were his xenogeneic geno arts.\n\nThey included Blood-Pulse Sutra, Xuan Yellow Sutra, and Jadeskin. She was able to use those geno arts.\n\nThe Dongxuan Sutra and The Story of Genes were something she was unable to cast.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He transformed into xenogeneic battle body mode and told Bao\u2019er, \u201cWhat about this? Can you look like me right now?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er used her sunglasses and scanned him again. She successfully turned into the Han Sen xenogeneic mode. Like before, while she was in xenogeneic mode, she was only able to use Jadeskin and Blood-Pulse Sutra. She was still unable to use the Dongxuan Sutra and The Story of Genes.\n\nRegarding the Super God Spirit mode, no matter what mode she was in, Bao\u2019er could not make use of it.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cIt\u2019s just enough. Bao\u2019er can use xenogeneic mode to disguise herself as Dollar, and I can come out representing myself Han Sen.\u201d He gave Bao\u2019er the evil lotus ring, sky bone armor, and kill sky hammer to see if she could effectively use them.\n\nBao\u2019er used the evil lotus ring and sky bone armor. The evil lotus ring shone with a purple light. It turned into a purple shadow that covered her body.\n\nThis was the evil lotus bai sema. It had good resistance to every power. It was good stuff for the purpose of surviving.\n\nThe sky bone armor had a knife light. It was like many knife lights protecting Bao\u2019er. The sky bone armor was a very rare armament that could attack and defend. The knife light protected the body to provide powerful defense, and the knife light was also like a saw that could strike things. It was very powerful.\n\nThe kill sky hammer was able to break space in a single hit. The power it possessed was ridiculous. Any bai sema would break under the kill sky hammer.\n\n\u201cWhen Bao\u2019er enters xenogeneic mode, she is very powerful. With these three god personality armaments and me next to her, she should be fine. She will just leave if anything bad happens.\u201d Han Sen thought this was doable. He explained things to her once and asked if she wanted to take part.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er can become Dollar-Dad. That will be so fun, Bao\u2019er will love it.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked very excited.\n\n\u201cMoment God\u2019s power is unpredictable,\u201d Han Sen told Bao\u2019er. \u201cYou need to be careful. Listen to my commands. You will enter the god temple later, and you will be the first one to leave. You cannot risk fighting Moment God. Just pretend and swing the hammer a few times. Your father has got this.\u201d\n\nLittle Angel had been drinking geno fluid by the gallon, and she was almost maxed out. She still probably would not catch up and be at what was required for the fight in that god temple just yet.\n\nThe next day, Han Sen had to meet up with Fox Queen. He became Dollar and wore the Sky God Crown. He returned to his God of Wealth Temple.\n\nThe God of Wealth Temple had just opened. Fox Queen secretly came before the god temple. While still outside, she said, \u201cI am Fox Queen. Please, let me see you Mister God of Wealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Han Sen stood atop his altar. He looked very serious when he spoke.\n\n\u201cGreetings, Mister!\u201d After Fox Queen entered the temple, she bowed.\n\n\u201cWhat I promised you is possible,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. \u201cWere you doubting my power?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never dream of doing that. It\u2019s just the Nine-Spin Destiny Mirror is too important to the Fox race. That is why I feel very nervous. Please forgive me.\u201d Fox Queen was very scared as she kowtowed. At the same time, she was very excited.\n\n\u201cHmph. Take it.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. The Nine-Spin Destiny Mirror appeared in the air. It flew toward Fox Queen.\n\nWhen Fox Queen had the Nine-Spin Destiny Mirror in her hands, the Sky God Crown displayed a message in Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cWish fulfilled. Received 300 lifespan. An additional requirement master and slave contract is available.\u201d\n\nMany lifespan years flew out of Fox Queen and went toward Han Sen. Han Sen witnessed his lifespan increase. He had a lifespan of another 300 years. His total lifespan was almost 3,000 years now.\n\nHan Sen also saw that Fox Queen\u2019s forehead had a mark that said, \u201cGod of Wealth\u2019s Wealth.\u201d It had some special connection to the Sky God Crown."
