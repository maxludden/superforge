    "text": "Han Sen wanted to go back, but Barr was hounding him. He wasn\u2019t going to let Han Sen return to his friends.\n\nToxic Dragon Old Six missed his attack, but he did not stop. He ran towards the Feather woman, with a toxic light leaking from his fist. He really was like a toxic dragon.\n\nThe Feather woman kept dodging, though. She maneuvered as gracefully as a dancer. She was just a Marquise, and yet she was acquitting herself well against the Duke Dragon Six. He was unable to land a single blow on her.\n\nA few of the Destroyed Dukes were headed for Little Angel. They looked murderous and cruel, and it was clear that they planned to destroy her.\n\nAs those attacks came down on Han Sen\u2019s group, a blue light suddenly shone from Han Meng\u2019er. It shielded Little Angel, Zero, Little Silver, and Little Star.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Destroyed Dukes hit the blue shield, but none of their attacks were able to do anything.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s using Han Sen\u2019s defense treasure!\u201d One of the Destroyed Dukes frowned. They knew Han Sen\u2019s shield was impervious to damage, even from something that was King class in power. So, they knew right away that they\u2019d be unable to hack their way through the shield.\n\n\u201cGood! If they have the defense treasure, then that means Han Sen has nothing to protect himself. We finally have an excuse for killing Han Sen!\u201d The Destroyed Duke that spoke looked cruel. He headed for Han Sen, who was leaping through the air, still engaged in combat with Barr.\n\n\u201cStay back! He is mine!\u201d Barr shouted and swung his knife at the approaching Dukes.\n\nThose Destroyed Dukes were almost struck by Barr. They all had to scramble and leap away, which left them angry and shocked.\n\n\u201cBarr! What are you doing?\u201d a Destroyed Duke shouted at Barr.\n\n\u201cI told you that he\u2019s mine, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Barr grunted as he moved in to attack Han Sen. Those Destroyed Dukes came to a standstill in mid-air, their faces turning green from Barr\u2019s rude refusal to accept their help.\n\n\u201cIgnore him! Find the traitor first,\u201d commanded a Destroyed Duke with hard eyes.\n\n\u201cYes, Mister Dia Robber.\u201d That group of Destroyed Dukes complied immediately, and so they all descended on the city and the women in it.\n\nThe Destroyed weren\u2019t the only ones doing this, though. Everyone started to attack the women who were of a different kind to themselves. They were all desperate to find the traitor.\n\nJust as Han Sen expected, everyone believed that the traitor was indeed a woman. But they did not know which race she belonged to, and so every woman became a target. Everyone started to attack without a second thought.\n\nIt was absolute chaos in every direction. Their fight had cascaded until the entire city turned into a battleground. Fortunately, Han Meng\u2019er and the others had the protection of the Demon Bug Bai Sema, so they were able to avoid being hit. There were no King class elites around, so no one present could break the Bai Sema. The Feather woman kept coming under attack by the furious Dragon Six, and everyone else had their eyes on her. She really did seem to be the most likely suspect.\n\nBarr attacked Han Sen in a fury. Han Sen relied on his dragon wings and Break Space Flash to avoid him. He didn\u2019t attack Barr, though. He did not want to risk making the crazy man any stronger.\n\nIce no longer worked on Barr. Han Sen fired volley after volley, but it wouldn\u2019t freeze him. Spell\u2019s freezing powers would only work if they hit the enemy. But now, the necklace was keeping the ice from making contact every single time. The freezing powers weren\u2019t going to work.\n\n\u201cThe Light Fireseed necklace is one of the deified treasures of the Destroyed, right? I cannot believe the Destroyed let Barr use it. How much do they want me dead?\u201d Han Sen chuckled darkly, then squinted at the necklace.\n\nHan Sen knew that the most famous treasures of the Destroyed were the Light Fireseed necklace, the Dark Eye Ring, and the Chaos Statue.\n\nBarr\u2019s neck looked to be adorned by that same Light Fireseed necklace.\n\nLife starts with fire, and it ends with fire. The legendary Light Fireseed necklace had the light of fire. It was one of the strongest fire element treasures, even possessing light powers.\n\nThe legends said that a deified Destroyed once owned that necklace. He used it to incinerate an entire system. It was quite a scary item, if the story was true.\n\nBut Barr was only a Duke. He could not use the might of the necklace in full. Even so, it was more than adequate to protect its bearer from any cold powers that came against him. Unless Han Sen was King class, there was no chance of him being able to freeze Barr this time.\n\nHan Sen flapped his wings. He flew one hundred meters away and fired his gun, shooting a few of the Destroyed Dukes that were nearby.\n\nPang! Pang!\n\nThe explosive sounds were everywhere, and the Destroyed Dukes were reduced to ash.\n\nHan Sen moved quickly, and he evaded each and every one of Barr\u2019s attacks. He kept shooting at the Destroyed as he went, raising their death toll higher and higher.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, fight me!\u201d Barr roared, but there was nothing he could do to stop Han Sen.\n\nDia Robber saw a Duke get wasted by Han Sen, and it made him frown. Then, he went after Han Sen with his fist raised.\n\nThe male face that represented light started to glow resplendently. His fist was like an actual sun, holding a candescent godlight.\n\nHan Sen flapped his wings and disappeared. He avoided the punch and fired his gun at Dia Robber.\n\nThe female face of Dia Robber represented darkness. She released a dark light. The ten fingers were like daggers that shredded the hail of bullets Han Sen fired at them.\n\nThe bullets exploded on contact, but the black power formed a bottomless black hole in the air that sucked in the bullets and swallowed their effects. They were removed from play.\n\n\u201cDia Robber! He is mine,\u201d Barr proclaimed angrily.\n\n\u201cThen kill him before I can,\u201d Dia Robber said coldly. The bird face of the middle represented chaos, and it began to produce light.\n\nA turbulent power leaked out of him to cover a radius of one thousand meters, and when Han Sen tried to use Break Space Flash, he realized he was unable to teleport anymore.\n\nBarr roared. He swung his bone knife through another flurry of attacks to smite Han Sen. He didn\u2019t try to force Dia Robber to leave as he had all the other Destroyed Dukes.\n\nDia Robber was coming for Han Sen now, too. The six arms released a trio of powers to damage Han Sen.\n\nDia Robber continually released a chaotic power into the air around him. Break Space Flash did not work anymore, so Han Sen was unable to teleport away to safety.\n\nFacing the attacks of two Dukes, Han Sen was now at a disadvantage. Han Sen relied on his movements and speed, and he had to operate at max capacity to stay ahead. But even so, it ultimately insufficient to avoid the attacks of both Barr and Dia Robber.\n\n\u201cIf I was a Duke, I wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of fighting them. But I am just a Marquise, and my power is far inferior to Dukes like Dia Robber.\u201d Han Sen thought about how he might deal with his current enemies. There were still things he wanted to gain from this situation.\n\n\u201cTraitor! She is the traitor!\u201d Suddenly, a deafening shout came from behind them. Everyone stopped to pay attention."
