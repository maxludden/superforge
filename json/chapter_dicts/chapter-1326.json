The noises were squeamish and driven from agony, and they weren\u2019t the sounds of humans being mercilessly slain.\n\n\u201cWhat maddening power has been employed? Why cannot even the vision of our own eyes breach that black veil? Why can\u2019t we see what\u2019s happening?!\u201d Gu Demon Emperor asked aloud, half-rhetorically with no genuine recipient of his cry in mind.\n\nThree-Eye Emperor had no clue, either. All he could see were the curtains of darkness.\n\nNo God Emperor spoke to them both, saying, \u201cThey are the powers of Night Empress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought she became a demi-god.\u201d Three-Eye Emperor said.\n\nNo God Emperor turned to look at him, speaking through clenched teeth. \u201cShe did. Yet, her meddling even has the capacity to play a hand in events this long after. But it is only a remnant of her power; if she was here physically among us, it would be worse than a simple blinding dark. This darkness won\u2019t last long, however.\u201d\n\nHearing him say this, the pair felt much safer themselves. Still, they were uncomfortable, and rightly so. The screams were unsettling, and their sources were coming from every-which-way. Not too far off, either.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s swords might have been believed to have been forged with redstone, for the claret that coated it. When a spirit caught sight of him coming for them, it was too late for them to react. They\u2019d die within the second, cut down via Ghost Slash.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Han Sen going on a murder spree in the dark. Xie Qing King and Moment Queen had joined in, mowing down plenty of spirits with alongside him.\n\nThe super creatures and spirits were little more than pigs or lambs in a slaughterhouse.\n\nIn that suffocating darkness, numbers meant little. And some super creatures and spirits had been driven so wild and mad with fear, they lashed out at anything that drew near them. That included their own teammates, resulting in a fair amount of friendly fire being issued across the board.\n\nAside from Han Sen and his companions, none could make heads or tails of what was going on.\n\nTen minutes later, the darkness was lifted. When the black curtains rose, the diorama left on display shocked the hearts and eyes of all who saw it.\n\nFlower Empress and Heavenly Empress almost threw up due to the grizzly sight. The entire shelter was a monument to blood and death now. Only a handful of the army had been left alive by this point; a mixture of king spirits and super creatures that were revealed to be helplessly fleeing, drenched in the blood of their fallen compatriots.\n\nHan Sen and his people were standing strong, also. Not a single member of his band of allies had been touched.\n\nHan Sen and his companions ran forward to immediately cut down those who had been left alive, finishing them off in one last ghastly display, as if to intentionally provoke the audience that had been sitting at the edge of their seats for a glimpse of what had happened before the veil was lifted.\n\nOne spirit even killed himself, to spare the pain and shame. He was so afraid, he wished to return to his spirit stone by his own volition, in fear his stone would break via the power Han Sen wielded.\n\nOther spirits tried doing the same as well, thinking it a good idea. But only a few could do it in time.\n\nBut this had already happened quite a bit earlier, when it was dark.\n\nFlower Empress and Heavenly Empress could not believe that the army of spirits and creatures that had been amassed had been utterly laid to waste in the space of ten minutes.\n\nGu Demon Emperor and Three-Eye Emperor could hardly believe what they were seeing, either. They didn\u2019t even think it was possible, and if it was, this was the sort of event one could only be around to witness once every one million years.\n\nThree-Eye Emperor himself wished to flee, in fear that it was only a matter of time before Han Sen had him in his sights. Gruesome scenes were nothing foreign to him, but that mangled mess made his stomach churn.\n\nHis mind started to become blank, crushed under the struggle to comprehend how such a powerful force had been squashed so easily by a human and a few of his fellows.\n\nSome spirits who did not answer the call could only breathe a sigh of relief, glad they had stayed put.\n\nSuddenly, though, a new and strong lifeforce appeared. It was coming to the area faster than ever; it was another emperor.\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor has come!\u201d Gu Demon Emperor called out, as if it would be his saving grace.\n\nEveryone turned to look at a grey fog, hanging in the sky. It had been unleashed by a beast he rode upon. The grey mist was being emitted by exhaust points on the creature\u2019s feet. It was a wild and wonderful creature to see, but magnificent and scary, too.\n\n\u201cYou are Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir, correct?\u201d the emperor immediately asked Zero.\n\n\u201cYou and the rest of your buddies are as sharp as a bag of socks, do you know that? You\u2019ve all come here through a misunderstanding, but we\u2019ve met your call for wanting a fight. You\u2019re just another challenger amongst the many we have already vanquished. If you want to die, just say the word.\u201d Han Sen was no longer in the mood, and he knew the emperor would want to try his luck. So, without even waiting for a response, he grabbed his swords and took off running towards Ruin Emperor.\n\nTo show them who was boss, Han Sen knew he\u2019d have to meet every challenge and challenger. He couldn\u2019t back down if he wanted to assert dominance and avoid a repeat of the day\u2019s events in the future.\n\nThe emperor saw Han Sen disappear, but he did not move to dodge.\n\nDong!\n\nThe Phoenix Sword\u2019s power of time and space had suddenly stopped working. And it was at that point, Han Sen realized his own body\u2019s power of time and space had been sapped away.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s companions seeing his powers suddenly cease to work, they rallied to his side to provide him aid in the fight against the emperor.\n\nWhen they tried attacking the emperor, though, even all their attacks disappeared before him.\n\nThey were each in shock, all feeling as if their powers had been robbed from them.\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor from Ultimate Mountain!\u201d Moment Queen looked as if she had been shaken to her very core, upon realizing who their latest foe was.\n\n\u201cHe is Ruin Emperor?\u201d Dry Bone King looked petrified.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just those two feeling like that, either. They each and all did."
