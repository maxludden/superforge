    "text": "Han Sen had noticed the same thing. Violet was the only Flower God they had seen this entire time. The only other people around them were members of other races. Since being in the Space Garden, they had yet to see a single other Flower God.\n\nThis was the home of the Flower Gods. Even if something had happened, they still should have been encountering other members of Violet\u2019s race.\n\nEveryone had warning sirens blaring in their heads. They followed Violet carefully as they flew through the Space Garden, but they didn\u2019t see anything dangerous around.\n\nAnd there was no sign of a battle, either. It looked as if nothing concerning had actually happened.\n\nBut when they reached the highest flower field, what they saw froze them in place.\n\nThey saw many men and women with their bodies buried in the field. Only half their heads were sticking up above the soil. Each of them had a flower on their heads. Some of them were peonies, and some looked like chrysanthemums. Each flower was unique, and they all looked like they were opening in bloom.\n\nClearly, the people who looked like carrots in the flower fields were the missing Flower Gods.\n\n\u201cViolet, what is this?\u201d Bai Wanjie asked Violet.\n\nThe Flower Gods buried in the ground were still alive, but they were as still as half-buried vegetables.\n\nEver so slowly, their lifeforces seemed to be waning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, Mr. Crown Prince. The whole of the Flower Gods, myself excluded, are here,\u201d Violet said as he pointed at the half-buried heads in the field.\n\nBai Wanjie didn\u2019t ask how the Flower Gods had ended up in such a strange situation. Instead, he asked Violet, \u201cBefore you left the Space Garden, were they already buried this way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very smart, Mr. Crown Prince.\u201d Violet nodded and admitted this to be the case.\n\n\u201cSo, when you said that the Flower Gods wanted to become a higher place, it was all a lie? A trick that you used to lure us here?\u201d Bai Wanjie asked, staring at Violet.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Violet nodded again. He clearly didn\u2019t intend to hide anything.\n\nViolet and Bai Wanjie just stared at each other. They didn\u2019t look away. Violet went on to say, \u201cAlthough I lied about the cause, I truly intend to offer you the prize that I promised. If any of you can save my people, we are willing to sign a contract that will offer up half of the Space Garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d Everyone\u2019s eyes brightened.\n\n\u201cYou guys have seen what has happened to the Flower Gods. Do you think we have the gall, let alone the power, to break our promise?\u201d Violet drawled. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your people? Can you explain it to us now?\u201d Bai Wanjie looked at the heads protruding from the flower fields.\n\nThe fields were indescribable. Flower Gods were planted in the soil as far as the eye could see. There were millions of them. And with the small flowers rising from each head, they looked so pretty.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter how pretty they were, though. They were half-buried in the soil, which made the whole scene rather disturbing.\n\nViolet was no longer trying to withhold information. For the first time since they had met him, Violet explained what happened completely.\n\nThe Flower Gods were good at gardening, and they had discovered the Space Garden long ago. It was a suitable place for many xenogeneic plants to grow. They thought they had lucked out, but they soon found out that there was something wrong with the xenogeneic space.\n\nThe leader of the Flower Gods buried himself in the flower fields, just like Han Sen and the others were seeing now.\n\nThe Flower Gods didn\u2019t know why their leader did that, but they eventually figured out what was going on. They needed to appease the garden itself. Every once in a while, they would bring sacrifices to the garden. That way, the garden would no longer mess with their minds. As long as they kept the garden satisfied, it wouldn\u2019t force any of the Flower Gods to bury themselves.\n\nBut as time went by, the Space Garden seemed to become hungrier. It required more xenogeneics to support itself. Two months ago, the sacrifice that they buried in the flower fields was useless. The Flower God leader and many elites suddenly dug holes in the field and buried themselves there.\n\nAside from Violet, every Flower God was now buried there.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys bury yourselves as they did?\u201d asked a small race deified as he looked on Violet with suspicion. Clearly, he didn\u2019t believe the tale that Violet was spinning.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Only I was okay. I don\u2019t feel any danger. And I don\u2019t know why this happened. That is why I am begging you all to save my people. We will never turn back on our word,\u201d Violet said with a look of seriousness.\n\n\u201cHave you tried digging them out?\u201d a King class elite asked.\n\nThat question was kind of pointless. The Flower Gods had been buried there for a while. Violet must have tried everything already. Violet would only have contacted outside deifieds if he had no other choice. He had exhausted all of his options.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t dig them up. The soil might seem normal, but it is incredibly durable. You cannot dig through this land, and you might even hurt the people in the soil,\u201d Violet answered.\n\nOne of the elites tried to grab a handful of the soil. The eyes of everyone watching widened. The Kings, and even the deifieds, couldn\u2019t summon enough power to rip out a chunk of that turf.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of soil is this? Why is it so resilient?\u201d a King class elite asked in shock.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. When they dug the holes to bury themselves, it didn\u2019t seem that difficult. But when I tried digging them out, I couldn\u2019t dislodge even a tiny piece of the ground\u2026\u201d Violet explained the situation to them once.\n\nThe elites tried many tests, but each attempt to crack this puzzle failed. They were unable to free the denizens of the flower fields.\n\nMany of the elites focused on the task with feverish intensity. They thought of all kinds of methods, trying to get the half-buried Flower Gods out. But their efforts accomplished nothing. All of their attempts were fruitless.\n\nOne deified elite even grabbed a Flower God by the head. The Flower God\u2019s neck almost broke, and he still didn\u2019t move an inch.\n\nThe elites were there to save people, not kill them. So, the deified elite stopped trying to yank the head out.\n\n\u201cSan Mu, what do you think is going on here?\u201d Xie Qing King turned and asked Han Sen. He didn\u2019t know what to make of the half-buried Flower Gods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit creepy, to say the least.\u201d Han Sen squinted slightly as he spoke. He was checking out those half-buried Flower Gods, but he seemed to notice something.\n\n\u201cWeird. It\u2019s almost like the entire Space Garden is giving off a lifeforce\u2026 What if the Space Garden itself is a giant creature?\u201d When Han Sen came up with an answer, it was something that not even he could believe."
