    "text": "Blood continued to fountain out of the insect\u2019s mouth, spilling all over the place. It looked as if something was fighting its way out.\n\n\u201cDollar?\u201d Dragon One and Dragon Eight asked together, squinting at the figure that emerged. They could barely believe their eyes. They wanted to scream, but their question came out as a whisper.\n\nHe had been eaten by a deified creature, and yet he hadn\u2019t been killed. It was a miracle.\n\nHan Sen finished pulling himself free and climbed to his feet. He didn\u2019t have any blood on him. He didn\u2019t even look injured. Dragon One stared at him in disbelief.\n\nThe weird insect shrieked and thrashed a little. It looked to be in a great deal of pain. Instead of pursuing Han Sen, it just drilled back into the earth and disappeared.\n\nThe green area power that had covered the sky suddenly disappeared. Dragon Eight stared at the hole it left behind in bewilderment.\n\n\u201cDollar, what did you do?\u201d Dragon Eight asked slowly, his voice a little shaken.\n\n\u201cNothing. I just thought I\u2019d hurt it a little.\u201d Han Sen paused for a moment, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Once it heals, I doubt we\u2019ll be able to escape again.\u201d\n\nPutting action to words, Han Sen left the ground and headed out of Planet Dark Zone\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nHe had wanted to kill the weird insect, but the creature was way too strong. It had taken all of Han Sen\u2019s strength to keep using super spank on the weird insect\u2019s core. Despite exhausting all of his energy and approaching the time limit of his super god spirit body, he was only able to leave a single crack across the core. He hadn\u2019t been able to actually break it.\n\nLuckily, although the weird insect was strong, it wasn\u2019t smart. The crack in the creature\u2019s core was small and not terribly threatening, but the bug had chosen to run away even so. If it had continued going after Han Sen, his super god spirit would have given out eventually. He could have died.\n\nDragon One, Dragon Eight, Dia Robber, and the newly reassembled Barr didn\u2019t hesitate. They followed Han Sen away from Planet Dark Zone.\n\nThe five of them didn\u2019t speak, and they flew as fast as they could until they were well beyond Planet Dark Zone. The weird insect didn\u2019t follow, which all of them were incredibly grateful for.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re all injured, and I need to go take a rest. Let\u2019s split up here,\u201d Han Sen said, preparing to use his self-universe cogwheel to leave the universal core area.\n\nHe had an idea about how to deal with the weird insect, but he was too weak to do anything about it now. He would have to wait until he was stronger.\n\nDragon One said, \u201cDollar, if you still want to work together, we should set up a time and place to meet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be hard to fit you into my schedule, but we can discuss this when I find the time.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want to set up a meeting time because he was currently in the Extreme King. He wouldn\u2019t always be able to come here on a schedule.\n\n\u201cShould we have a way of contacting each other?\u201d Dragon Eight said.\n\nIn the geno universe, the stronger ones always earned respect. Everyone wanted friends who were stronger than them.\n\nEspecially friends like Han Sen. He was a first-tier King capable of fighting against a deified xenogeneic. Plus, he had proven his ability to hurt many scary people. It almost seemed like he was deified already. If someone could make friends with him, they would. After all, it would be better to have him as an ally than an enemy.\n\nDragon One and Dragon Eight wanted to maintain a good relationship with him. Even if they couldn\u2019t be friends, they wanted Han Sen to think positively about them. Finding yourself at odds with someone like him was never a good plan.\n\n\u201cSo you are Dollar. You are even stronger than the stories say. When would you like to fight me?\u201d Barr asked, looking at Han Sen.\n\nDia Robber laughed and said, \u201cBarr, stop messing around. Today, Dollar was the sole reason that we survived. If you don\u2019t mind, Dollar, please leave us a contact number. We would like to pay the debt we now owe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I was just trying to save myself. You don\u2019t need to contact me again. We\u2019ll meet again whenever luck decides,\u201d Han Sen said, then used his self-universe cogwheel. After a while, a giant metal cogwheel door appeared, and Han Sen walked through it and left.\n\nNow that his self-universe cogwheel had been activated, it would continue running on its own. Using it didn\u2019t require any additional energy.\n\nOpening the door to the universal core hall did have some requirements, though. Once Han Sen began the process of summoning the door using his self-universe cogwheel, he couldn\u2019t move it. If he moved away from the door, he would destroy the connection. At that point, he\u2019d have to start the process all over.\n\nIn addition, summoning the door took a while. It would be impossible to summon during combat, so the door couldn\u2019t be used as an escape route if Han Sen got into trouble.\n\nPlus, when he returned to the core area, he would end up exactly where he had left the previous time. He wouldn\u2019t just randomly teleport to some other location in the core area.\n\n\u201cBrother Dragon One, who is this Dollar? Can you tell me?\u201d Dia Robber looked at Dragon One.\n\nDragon One shook his head. \u201cWe met him by chance, and we worked together twice. We don\u2019t know much about him. No more than you guys do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never heard of a race called \u2018human\u2019 before. How could they have produced an elite like that? It is confusing.\u201d Dia Robber asked, his expression mystified.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that because of Dollar, humans might become famous across the universe. We don\u2019t know if there are any other strong humans. If he\u2019s the only one with such strength, like Kong Fei was, he would still be alone. He cannot change the world, in that case,\u201d Dragon One answered.\n\nThe four of them lost themselves in deep thought. None of them said anything. And eventually, they all used their self-universe cogwheels to leave the universal core hall.\n\nAfter Dia Robber returned to the Destroyed, he went looking for other Destroyed Kings. He asked the ones he could find to stay in the vicinity of Planet Dark Zone. They were to wait inside the core area, and if Dollar re-appeared, they would contact Dia Robber at once.\n\nCoincidentally, when Dragon One returned to the Dragon, he did exactly the same thing. Clearly, they were waiting for Han Sen to return to the core area, too.\n\nHan Sen came out of the universal core hall back in Underwater Town. Bao\u2019er was lying on his bed, and she rubbed her eyes when she heard movement. Seeing that it was Han Sen, she leaped into his arms.\n\n\u201cDad? Where were you? Why didn\u2019t you take me?\u201d Bao\u2019er lifted her lips.\n\n\u201cI reached King class a few days ago. I got pulled into the core area.\u201d Han Sen looked at Bao\u2019er and asked, \u201cCan you and the little bird enter the core area?\u201d\n\n\u201cCore area? What is that?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked in confusion.\n\nIf Bao\u2019er did not know, then she probably couldn\u2019t join him. And the little red bird was deified, so it couldn\u2019t go in with him, either. Otherwise, Han Sen could use the little red bird to kill the weird insect.\n\nHan Sen had used his super god spirit mode for too long, and his body was exhausted. He felt very powerless and sore. Han Sen didn\u2019t plan on returning to the core area anytime soon. He rested for a few days and ate some of the core xenogeneic genes each day. His number of King genes kept increasing.\n\nHis body had almost recovered when the day came for him to enter Destiny\u2019s Tower. He didn\u2019t want to be late, and so he arrived at the site an hour early.\n\nThe Extreme King were quite effective. They had four elites on standby to open the door of Destiny\u2019s Tower for Han Sen and let him in."
