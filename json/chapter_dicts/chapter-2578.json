    "text": "If it wasn\u2019t for the small Crocodile God\u2019s body having a high mass that made it tougher than the average deified xenogeneic, it would have been ripped to shreds by the Six Core God Snake.\n\nIt was a shame the small Crocodile God was so young. Its body wasn\u2019t strong enough to completely repel the damage done to it by the Six Core God Snake\u2019s space powers. More and more wounds appeared on its body as time went by. The small Crocodile God was so scared that it looked like the creature was about to wet itself.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake kept using its space substance chains to lash the small Crocodile God\u2019s body. It eventually got tired of doing this, and so it just opened its mouth. Its scary fangs came bearing down on the small Crocodile God.\n\nThe small Crocodile God\u2019s small eyes widened in terror. Tears fell as it desperately tried to wiggle its way out of the snake\u2019s grasp. But under the restrictions imposed by the substance chains, the little creature had no hope of running. The Six Core God Snake\u2019s fangs were going to slice into him.\n\nPang!\n\nSuddenly, a cold metal light appeared, slamming into one of the Six Core God Snake\u2019s green cogwheels. The Six Core Snake God screamed in agony.\n\nThe small Crocodile God saw a giant metal pillar thrust its way through the eye-like cogwheel. Han Sen was behind that metal pillar, and he punched the back of the metal pillar continuously to drive it in deeper.\n\nThe small Crocodile God was as happy as it was shocked. The Six Core God Snake shuddered with every blow. It was in pain. The space substance chains that had bound the small Crocodile God loosened. The small Crocodile God\u2019s black light shone, and it managed to escape from the grip of the substance chains.\n\nHan Sen continued to pummel the back end of the Sky God Pillar. He had stolen that deified treasure from the Extreme King. He couldn\u2019t use all his power, but his attacks so far seemed to be effective. He shoved the pillar into the cogwheel until the cogwheel cracked. With the Sky God Pillar lodged inside, the cogwheel could no longer spin.\n\nIt was a shame that Han Sen wasn\u2019t deified. Otherwise, with his deified power combined with the Sky God Pillar, his blows could simply shatter the Six Core God Snake\u2019s cogwheels.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake lowered its head and caught sight of Han Sen. It roared with rage. Its body unleashed several substance chains that looked like snakes. They flew straight for Han Sen.\n\nEach space substance chain seemed to tear the fabric of space as it came. It was like a space cutting skill. If Han Sen\u2019s body was unable to withstand one of those space cuts, he would be ripped apart by the power of the chains.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t plan on trying to avoid the lashing, though. His body shone with gold light, and a collection of gold, robotic plates of armor formed around him. He turned into the Gold Robot General.\n\nThe space substance chains came against the gold robot armor, slicing into the surface of the metal armor. It was like many invisible knives were trying to drive through the armor. Sparks erupted across the surface of the gold armor like fireworks.\n\nBecause Han Sen\u2019s gold armor was so hard, the space substance chains were unable to completely cut through it.\n\nHan Sen shoved the gold general\u2019s speed to the max, and streamers of golden energy spewed out of the armor\u2019s metal pipes. It was like a pair of golden wings were spreading from the armor on Han Sen\u2019s back.\n\nThe gold general drew back an arm as far as it would go, then threw a punch forward like a volcano erupting. The punch landed on the back of the Sky God Pillar.\n\nThe Sky God Pillar was driven forward by the impact of the golden general\u2019s fist. A loud cracking sound came from the Six Core God Snake\u2019s cogwheel. The cogwheel was completely shattered by the Sky God Pillar, and the pillar pierced through the Six Core God Snake\u2019s neck.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake shrieked in pain and swung its tail against Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen saw the tail coming, but he couldn\u2019t avoid it. The tail seemed to cast shadows all through space. He couldn\u2019t see it clearly, and it crashed against his gold general armor.\n\nThe gold general was hit, and Han Sen was sent flying away like a star. He slammed into a giant planet, and the power of his fall poisoned the planet with radiation. A shockwave covered half the planet.\n\nMountains fell and the ground was lifted. The rocks rolled like waves. Half of the planet suddenly looked like the end of the world.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake didn\u2019t stop there. It hurtled forward, straight for the planet where its enemy had landed. Countless space substance chains coiled around the snake as it headed for the gold general who was down on the planet.\n\n\u201cSmall Crocodile God\u2026 what are you waiting for? Gravity area!\u201d Han Sen shouted.\n\nThe small Crocodile God was still frozen, but hearing Han Sen\u2019s voice shook him out of his shock. He cast his gravity substance chains, generating a black shield that covered the Six Core God Snake. Under the influence of that power, the snake accelerated like an asteroid as it fell to the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nStill in the gold armor, Han Sen stood up. He stomped on the ground and used his gold energy. The gold energy started to run out of the pipes in a stream, then a river. It was like a thruster pack that lifted the gold general into the sky. It was headed for the falling Six Core God Snake.\n\nHan Sen guided the gold general, using it to gather up power inside his fist. A powerful gold godlight manifested across it. Han Sen\u2019s fist flashed forward, battering the Sky God Pillar that was still attached to the Six Core God Snake\u2019s neck.\n\nThe Sky God Pillar punched straight through the body of the Six Core God Snake. Even the gold general itself ended up ripping through the snake\u2019s body.\n\nThe gold general slowed to a stop. Still holding onto the giant Sky God Pillar, Han Sen turned and looked back at the Six Core God Snake. The force of gravity was still making it fall toward the planet.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Six Core God Snake hit the planet with a force that was scarier than Han Sen\u2019s descent. This was definitely not that planet\u2019s lucky day. It had taken two scary hits in a row, and now, it looked completely destroyed.\n\n\u201cNice job, small Crocodile God. Keep applying gravity to that fiend!\u201d Han Sen shouted as he piloted the gold general down to press the Sky God Pillar against the Six Core God Snake.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake was severely limited by the incredible force weighing down on it. The creature\u2019s movements were incredibly slow, and it was completely unable to dodge the gold general\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake shrieked strangely. Countless space substance chains opened like a chrysanthemum, then came for Han Sen. They stretched forward to hold him off, trying to keep him from directly approaching the Six Core God Snake.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, and he didn\u2019t dodge, He pushed the power of the gold general to the max as he headed for the Six Core God Snake.\n\nAs countless space substance chains tangled around the gold general, Han Sen shouted. He used the gold general to toss the Sky God Pillar in front of himself, and then, there was a burst of gold energy. A punch that was prettier than the sun came forth to strike the back of the Sky God Pillar.\n\nThe Sky God Pillar became a pillar of light. Every part of the pillar shone as it tore through the planet\u2019s atmosphere and slammed into another cogwheel. The Six Core God Snake had been unable to run.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake was restrained by the small Crocodile God\u2019s gravity substance chains, and so it couldn\u2019t even jerk to the side to avoid the strike. Another cogwheel core snapped in half under the force of the blow. The pillar pinned the beast to the planet as it screamed in pain.\n\nThe space substance chains broke, shattering into a million pieces as the snake thrashed. Han Sen used the gold general to jump past the falling remnants of the substance chains. He was headed for the Six Core God Snake that was pinned to the planet.\n\nThe small Crocodile God roared happily."
