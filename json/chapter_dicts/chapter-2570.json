    "text": "Han Sen thought for a while. He brought a few pieces of fruit out of Destiny\u2019s Tower to give to the Crocodile God.\n\n\u201cThis little Crocodile God is just a baby. It should be an easy thing to please. All I need to do is keep it happy, then I can do anything I want. I wonder if it is a vegetarian? I don\u2019t have much meat stockpiled at the moment.\u201d Ever since Han Sen started collecting King xenogeneic genes, he hadn\u2019t been eating anything else. The fruit was something he had saved for Bao\u2019er.\n\nBut ever since Bao\u2019er had found that purple ginseng, she hadn\u2019t shown interest in anything else. No other type of fruit enticed her, so Han Sen had been keeping them inside Destiny\u2019s Tower the whole time.\n\nIf someone wanted their body to evolve, the process would take a lot more than just practicing various geno arts. The higher class a person was, the more energy their body would require. And the food they consumed had to be of greater quality. That was the only way to deliver the extra needed energy. Every creature in the universe had to eat; the only differences were in how and what they ate.\n\nHigh-class elites could go without food for a long time, but the price they paid for that was the consumption of their energy. If that went on for a long time, their bodies would be damaged quite severely.\n\nWhen people said they didn\u2019t need to eat while practicing, it was a load of rubbish. In real life, you would die if you didn\u2019t eat. The starvation process just took a little longer for strong people than for the weak.\n\nThis didn\u2019t just apply to warriors with ordinary levels of power. In Han Sen\u2019s experience, even guys that called themselves \u201cGod\u201d had to eat, too. But instead of eating flesh, they ate the lifespan of the people that came to them to make wishes.\n\nThe little Crocodile God had to eat, too, but it didn\u2019t show any interest in the fruit Han Sen had given it. It used its tail to sweep all the pieces of fruit away.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it doesn\u2019t eat fruit or veggies. In that case, what kind of food does it eat?\u201d Han Sen tried to guess, but he had no meat to share. Then again, Han Sen doubted that the creature wanted to eat meat, either. If it had, Han Sen, Li Keer, and Exquisite would\u2019ve already become crocodile chow.\n\nThe little God Crocodile growled at Han Sen. This was the second time, and it was clearly rushing Han Sen to get to work. And so he did, clearing the shattered crystals all around him.\n\nThe little Crocodile God had assumed the role of the inspector. It commanded Han Sen to do things, like throwing the shattered crystals out of the fortress and into the lava sea that was held at bay outside.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t in a rush, and neither was he annoyed. He just stuck to his tasks of sweeping and cleaning up, hoping to find something useful as he went.\n\nThe small God Crocodile was pleased with Han Sen\u2019s work ethic. The little Crocodile God seemed born to be a supervisor, and it seemed very pleased to be doing this sort of work.\n\nBut Han Sen failed to find anything interesting as he went. And when the little God Crocodile eventually grew bored, it brought Han Sen back to the swimming pool with it.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived back at the swimming pool, he found Li Keer and Exquisite giving the big Crocodile God a head massage. They were using a brush to scrub its body, too.\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite looked like a perfect picture of misery. They had never dreamed of being forced to do something this demeaning.\n\nThey had been taught that as members of the Very High, their futures held incredible potential. They had dreamed of doing many things, but never of working as a crocodile\u2019s maids. Especially with someone like Dollar around to see their humiliation.\n\nThe big Crocodile God was a harsh taskmaster, but Li Keer and Exquisite were eventually allowed a break.\n\n\u201cDid you find anything around here?\u201d Exquisite asked Han Sen, as the two of them approached.\n\n\u201cJust more shattered crystal. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a single thing of interest, otherwise.\u201d Han Sen had already stuffed the arm bones into his Destiny\u2019s Tower. He didn\u2019t plan on informing the girls about his discovery.\n\n\u201cWhat about you two?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cWhat could we find? All we\u2019ve been doing is sweeping up crap all day. I have no idea how these two eat so much. They piss wherever they like, too,\u201d Li Keer said, her expression morose.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart leaped. He quickly asked, \u201cCan you tell me what they\u2019ve been eating?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the hell should I know what they eat? Their dung is like firm orbs. It looks just like the materials that make up the planet itself,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cIn that case, maybe they are eating material that comes from the planet,\u201d Han Sen said after a moment of thought.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of knowing what they eat?\u201d Li Keer asked.\n\n\u201cIt would let us rest easy in the knowledge that they don\u2019t want to eat us, at least. If that\u2019s the case, we are quite lucky,\u201d Han Sen said with a shrug of his shoulders.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be trapped in here for the rest of my life, I think I would rather die.\u201d Li Keer didn\u2019t agree with Han Sen\u2019s line of thinking.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t carrying much food ourselves. We need to find a way to get out of here,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cDo you know a way out of here?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cNot right now.\u201d Exquisite shook her head.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s no point in talking about it,\u201d Han Sen said gloomily.\n\nThe three of them rested for a while. The little Crocodile God soon came over, hurrying them back to work.\n\nOut of the three, Han Sen had the best chance of working outside the pool area. The two girls were worse off, as they were stuck serving the Crocodile God on the beach. They swept up crap or massaged the crocodile\u2019s scales. They were just like maids.\n\nIt was likely that the crocodiles were the only beings in the universe using two of the Very High as maids, but god only knew how long they would enjoy this service.\n\nHan Sen was outside, setting toppled pieces of equipment upright or cleaning up devices that had been completely destroyed. In the beginning, the little Crocodile God was really interested in ordering him around. But after a while, it became too lazy and stopped.\n\nOnce he was free of his miniature overlord, Han Sen could walk around the fortress. While looking through a random plaza, he finally found something.\n\nCrystal was a technological product. It wasn\u2019t normally used to create things like tablets, but in that plaza, Han Sen found a crystal wall with text on it.\n\nBecause the crystal wall was broken, it took Han Sen almost three days to collect all of the fragments and piece the wall back together. Then, he was able to read the text in full.\n\n\u201cCrystal Furnace skill\u2026 This seems to be a geno art, but the name is very weird. I wonder what it does?\u201d Han Sen began reading through the content a little more closely.\n\nAfter all, the geno arts of the crystallizers were usually quite suitable for humans to practice. But Han Sen wasn\u2019t very hopeful for the potential of a crystallizer geno art, because the crystallizers weren\u2019t very famous for their geno arts. Their skills were rarely exceptional.\n\nBut after Han Sen read about the Crystal Furnace, he was given a fright.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t exactly a geno art. It was a godly skill for people who loved to eat.\n\nThe Crystal Furnace was a way to reinforce one\u2019s stomach. It was different from Consume, which focused on the ability to digest food. By contrast, the Crystal Furnace turned one\u2019s stomach into a nuclear reactor. It quickly released the energy of food, and the energy released would be immediately absorbed. The waste would come out quickly.\n\n\u201cNo wonder the crystallizers have such a reputation for research and development. Even their geno arts are scientific.\u201d Han Sen loved it. He wouldn\u2019t turn down a new geno art that aided his digestion.\n\nBut when Han Sen reached the end of the text for Crystal Furnace, he saw an additional note.\n\n\u201cThe public version of Crystal Furnace is only suitable for kids below sixteen. For those who are above sixteen, please practice Crystal Core Reactor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the kids\u2019 version?\u201d Han Sen was annoyed by that, but he couldn\u2019t find the adult version of Crystal Furnace, so he had to learn the kids\u2019 version first."
