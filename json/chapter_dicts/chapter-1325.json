The summoning bell must have been in the top ten greatest geno treasures of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nThree-Eye Emperor must have done her a great favor to be given this as a gift.\n\nThree-Eye smiled and said, \u201cWhat I did doesn\u2019t matter, but now that I have the bell, we should strike.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the three-eyed emperor put out his hand and balanced the bell on his palm. A red ribbon had been delicately tied upon the handle.\n\nThree-Eye Emperor looked on it with a strange look, or at least, that was how it appeared to others. In truth, he was operating it. And as he did so, a number of names flashed across the ribbon of the bell.\n\nThe handheld bell began to shake and chime all by itself, and each time it did, it was like a pulse. A number of names would quickly appear, slow down, and then stop. But when it moved again, more and more names appeared, different from before. There were countless numbers, and they were revealed to be the titles of the king spirits that populated the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nThe king spirits in the vicinity began to see a light appear in front of them.\n\n\u201cSummoning Sign?\u201d Many king spirits saw it and spoke, in great surprise. It was asking them to assault Moving Star Shelter.\n\nThe spirits accepted the light that hovered before them, and they were bestowed a buff.\n\nHan Sen was going to provoke more spirits to come and fight him, but before he could even issue the welcome of a challenge, he realized he did not have to say anything. A scary lifeforce was already coming his way, and he could feel its intimidating presence nearby.\n\nMany spirits came stampeding towards the shelter, with those spirits also bringing their subordinates in accompaniment. They ranged from lesser spirits to super creatures.\n\nHan Sen thought it was strange, seeing so many spirits co-operate like so.\n\nTheir numbers were frightening, too. And even if Han Sen was to survive the tide of spirits, there\u2019d be no guarantee his companions could. Xie Qing King was already worn out, so the chances of his survival were up in the air.\n\nStill, he knew it wasn\u2019t the time for panic. Instead, he remained calm and simply said, \u201cSave me, sister.\u201d\n\nMoment Queen understood Han Sen was going to stand firm and hold his position, despite the direness of the circumstances and the futility of even trying. But the spirits approached as if the entire attack was one large, pre-meditated, painstakingly crafted scheme for a conquest they had all co-operated on.\n\nMoment Queen thought to herself, \u201cYou should have left when I told you. Crying out for your sister won\u2019t help anything.\u201d\n\nEven Xie Qing King was looking glum. This was their first time to see Xie Qing King with a gloomy disposition. Their side had too few to stand strong and endure the agonizing wash of that tsunami of spirits that was to beset them.\n\nSnowball made sure to get all snug inside his white sphere of protection, while Baby Ghost began to stagger backwards, thinking, \u201cWhy did he ever choose to fight? Our fate was sealed before any of this fighting began! Why don\u2019t we run? Why don\u2019t we flee?!\u201d\n\nThe spirits were initially afraid of running headlong into battle against Han Sen. But seeing so many of their compatriots get together for a combined assault, bravery was instilled within them. They felt the tingle of courage course through their bodies, and when they moved in unison with the other spirits, they felt the desire to do it again and again until they were all rushing forward without fear.\n\n\u201cHow could the empress give Three-Eye Emperor a summoning bell?\u201d Flower Empress asked, semi-rhetorically. She looked sad when saying it.\n\nEast Empress heard her and said, \u201cI owed him one.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nGu Demon Emperor watched the army of spirits run towards the shelter and sighed. He said, \u201cIt is no wonder this bell is looked on as one of the most remarkable geno treasures to ever exist.\u201d\n\nAs the spirits spoke amongst each other, they were then surprised to see a purple-haired lady appear. She walked out of the shelter, as if to confront the ravenous army of spirits that were coming.\n\nThis was Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir, the one they had all assembled to seek and destroy.\n\n\u201cThere she is! That\u2019s her! That\u2019s Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir,\u201d Gu Demon Emperor spoke aloud.\n\nMany spirits noticed the coming of the purple-haired lady, and they knew that was the heir they had come to kill.\n\nNo God Emperor and the others hadn\u2019t fought yet, on this day.\n\nLotus Empress then appeared, as if she was leading Zero out from behind.\n\nLotus Empress heard Han Sen gently call for help, and she lifted her Night Gem and turned the entire region black. Darkness enveloped the shelter and encompassing lands.\n\nAll the spirits that were valiantly charging forward were shocked. It was as if they had all been blinded. It did not matter how great their vision was, for the black that took them could not be cut through by any manner of vision.\n\nSome fire-element spirits tried casting fire spells, in the hopes it would help illuminate the area. But they were shocked to see nothing. The darkness seemed to coat and choke everything, and no fire was strong enough to wash the black away or even reveal the grass they knew was underfoot.\n\nXie Qing King and Moment Queen were just as shocked as the attackers. The spirits and super creatures were beginning to panic, and they started to move about in hysteria, like headless chickens.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for, Zero? Do your thing,\u201d Han Sen prompted her to start attacking, and then he drew his own swords.\n\nThe Night Gem was a Demi-God Geno Core. It confused enemies by blanketing their world in pitch black darkness. It did not deal damage, but it didn\u2019t have to, considering the pain Zero and Han Sen were going to unleash.\n\nThe only downside to using it was that the effects only lasted ten minutes.\n\nNot wanting to waste a single second, Han Sen was keen to rush forward as quickly as he could and start attacking. He had to bring that horde down as quickly as he could.\n\nMoment Queen and the rest of Han Sen\u2019s companions also joined the fray. They ran towards the blind, panicking army and targeted the super creatures amongst them, first and foremost.\n\nThe entire shelter was painted red following this. A river of blood, muddied with a thousand mangled corpses, began to form."
