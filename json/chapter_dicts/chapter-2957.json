    "text": "Han Sen was afraid that if he leveled up and did not go into xenogeneic mode, he would only have a battle body. That would have been a waste.\n\nNow, there was no reason for him to be so cautious. Han Sen was not in his xenogeneic body. He only used Jadeskin to push himself this far, but he wanted to take Jadeskin to true god class first.\n\nAs soon as he started evolving, his four battle bodies started to change. He did not just level up one battle body out of his xenogeneic mode.\n\n\u201cNow, I know that if I am not in xenogeneic mode, I can still level up.\u201d Han Sen was happy. He thought leveling up one battle body was a waste. He also did not want to expose his xenogeneic mode, which was why he chose his Jadeskin. Now, four battle bodies were leveling up together. That was very good.\n\nThe cells of his composition quickly changed. The functions of his body greatly increased. The substance chains of his genes were modified. Han Sen\u2019s entire body was like it had been reborn.\n\nBecause Han Sen\u2019s whole body was wrapped up by Spell Armor, and the blue robe was dressing the Spell Armor, one only saw his head, face, hands, and Spell Armor.\n\nEven so, one was able to witness shocking changes. The white Spell Armor\u2019s spell flickered. The spells behaved like they were melting. They were melting into the armor. The armor turned bright. It looked like a crystal. It was as if it had burned into transparent metal.\n\nSeeing the black smoke cover the universe and space, it was like a demon landing atop the world. Han Sen clenched his fists and faced the black smoke, which covered the sky and covered the ground. He immediately punched.\n\nThe demon lady frowned. Old Vulture\u2019s black smoke was not just something powerful. It was not quite so straightforward. It had a power that could ravage one\u2019s soul. Even if the body was not hurt, touching the black smoke still resulted in death.\n\nHan Sen did not use treasure. He used his fist to fight Old Vulture\u2019s black smoke. The demon lady believed he must have had a death wish.\n\n\u201cKeep him alive!\u201d the demon lady shouted at Old Vulture. She was afraid that Old Vulture was too excited and would kill Han Sen. If that happened, the holy spirit would be gone.\n\nOld Vulture did not hear her. Earlier, it had been very sad. Now that it was able to fight with all of its power, its murderous mind was fully triggered. It could not think straight anymore. It was too late for the demon lady\u2019s reminder.\n\nThe demon lady saw Old Vulture looking murderous and knew the situation was bad. Along with the holy spirit being destroyed alongside Han Sen, Littleflower learning the truth would be very bad.\n\nIn the universe, there were not many phoenixes or Kirins around. There were xenogeneics similar to them. Like the demon lady, Old Vulture, eyeless best, their four powers were not much weaker than any of the holy beasts.\n\nThere were only four holy beasts there, and they had their reasons to be.\n\nThe four holy beasts were called the four holy beasts because they were the ultimate weapons Sacred Leader made to kill God. Sacred Leader used them to fight against God\u2019s holy spirit armament.\n\nOut of those four holy beasts, the only one that had the holy spirit armament was the Holy Kirin. The others, like the phoenix, ghost cast, and Nine-Life Cat, did not become holy spirits when Sacred was destroyed.\n\nNow, the ghost car and phoenix were gone. It was unknown whether or not they had lived or died. Nine-Life Cat guarded the sanctuaries, so the only holy spirit armament remaining was on the Holy Kirin. If it was destroyed, it would be very bad for Sacred\u2019s plan of rising from the ashes. They were missing this required powerful weapon.\n\nThe demon lady had many ideas flashing through her mind. She did not say anything. The black smoke and Han Sen\u2019s fist collided.\n\nIn the next moment, the demon lady and eyeless big beast opened their eyes wide. Han Sen\u2019s fist blew up the black smoke. It was like the black smoke was no greater than ordinary smoke. It was destroyed and unable to do anything.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fist punched the black smoke. The black smoke created a giant vacuum zone. Han Sen went through it and teleported in front of Old Vulture.\n\n\u201cVery good timing.\u201d Old Vulture was not shocked. It was happy.\n\nIt was the most invincible in the universe. It was a true god class xenogeneic fish bird. Aside from Sacred Leader, in that universe, it had never felt obliged to bow before anyone else. It would not retreat from combat against Han Sen.\n\nA bird sound shook the whole universe. Old Vulture flapped its wings. Its sharp claws had a rip space power. It was headed for Han Sen\u2019s fist.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe fist and talons collided. The Old Vulture\u2019s talons could shred anything in the universe, but they were broken by Han Sen\u2019s punch. The punching power did not relent there. It proceeded to strike Old Vulture in the chest.\n\nPang!\n\nOld Vulture\u2019s body was like a cannonball that fired away. It hit a planet. The impact broke the planet. It kept falling back and broke another planet. Then, there another one. It made the stars explode in space.\n\n\u201cHow\u2026 How\u2026 How is that possible?\u201d The eyeless beast was shocked and screamed. Fortunately, he had no eyes. If he had, his eyes would have popped out.\n\nThe eyeless big beast knew full-well how strong Old Vulture was. He was no worse than the phoenix or the ghost car. He was as good as a true god could be.\n\nEven though Han Sen had become true god class, he had only just become true god class. The pure power fight was not balanced. Now, he had released one punch and suppressed Old Vulture. On top of that, he had shattered Old Vulture\u2019s talons. How scary was that power?\n\nThe demon lady could not believe this either. One punch broke the fish bird\u2019s talons. In that universe, that kind of god power was probably only something Sacred Leader could showcase.\n\n\u201cI thought you wanted to fight! Now, let us fight!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s body flashed. He teleported above the eyeless big beast, waving his fist and punching toward it.\n\nThe eyeless big beast roared. Its body clenched together, which made its back sprout bones that were serrated. They spun quickly like a chainsaw. They were headed for Han Sen\u2019s fist.\n\nKatcha-cha!\n\nThe chainsaw-like bones were broken into many pieces. The shell on the eyeless big beast\u2019s back was punched away by Han Sen. It created a giant blood hole. The blood water was like a volcanic eruption. Its body flew away.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? So strong\u2026\u201d The demon lady could not believe her own eyes. With that kind of fitness or power, she was only afraid a holy body becoming true god class could do that. Han Sen was a creature that had not practiced a holy body, yet his body had reached this level. It was hard to believe.\n\n\u201cI thought you wanted the holy spirit?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s voice was in the demon lady\u2019s ear. He was right in front of her. His scary fist was in front of the demon lady.\n\n\u201cBeautiful Woman Charming Demon Heart Body!\u201d The demon lady\u2019s body suddenly changed. All her clothes ripped to reveal the splendor of her body.\n\nIt was perfect. It could steal a soul. Auntie Mei\u2019s entire body released some presence that no creature could resist. Even the sky, gods, and buddhas would have fallen for her. They would have killed themselves nine times for her.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen still punched her beautiful chest. His fist went right through it. Flesh, red blood, and snow-white skin contrasted to create a weird, scary, and beautiful scene."
