    "text": "Everyone was shocked. Meng Lie was already a larva class deified, and he had turned a larva-class black-scaled, nine-headed snake into a gold soldier. Even so, he was not able to deflect one small strike. How scary could that power be?\n\n\"Impossible... You are not Han Sen...\" Meng Lie was shaking and shivering as he emerged from the scrap heap. His hands were full of blood, but he did not care. He stared at the young man and spoke directly to him.\n\n\"Oh? Why am I not Han Sen? Is it because I did not use Under the Sky Knife skills? If you would like to watch me perform them, I can show you.\" The young man looked at Meng Lie with interest.\n\nAlmost at the same time, his body had an Under the Sky skill play out. The scary mind suddenly covered everything around. Even Second Uncle's face changed while witnessing it. His will was affected by the strength of that mind. It gave him a strange and unsettling feeling. It was like they had all become puppets. If that man wanted to, he could change their fates in the blink of an eye.\n\nHan Sen finally noticed the young man's knife mind was similar to his Under the Sky Knife skills, but it was a bit different. The young man's knife mind was more like the Very High mind. It was like he was the person who played chess. Everything was a chess piece, and the pieces were in his hands.\n\nIt was like Han Sen's mind, but he used himself as a chess piece. He was not the one who controlled the game of chess. The young man's mind was strong, and he was in no way inferior to him. He was a bit shocked that the young man might very well be the smartest person in the world. He just did not have a clue why he had disguised himself as Han Sen.\n\n\"You are not Han Sen,\" Meng Lie stubbornly repeated. He stared at the young man intently.\n\n\"Oh? Are you saying this because I have proven myself to be too strong and he is not that strong?\" the young man coldly asked.\n\nHearing the young man say that, everyone understood how Meng Lie was correct. That young man was not Han Sen.\n\n\"No. You have sensed it differently. Although you wear his face, you cannot copy his presence. You are not Han Sen.\" Meng Lie gnashed his teeth as he asked, \"So, who are you?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" the man coldly said. \"Han Sen is just a small, lowlife creature. It does not matter how I try to disguise myself as him. I still cannot get a hold of his cheap presence.\"\n\nSecond Uncle's face changed. He looked at the young man and said, \"If you are not Han Sen, then we are not your enemy. This was all just a big misunderstanding. How about we stop fighting now?\"\n\nThe young man lifted his lips, smiled, and asked, \"Did I not just tell you that from now on, you must all listen to my command? If you perform your duties well, I might be inclined to spare your lives.\"\n\n\"You really are powerful, but if we got into a real fight, there is no guarantee you can win. Why not be friends instead of enemies? This time, you offended us. If you stop now, you can become an ally of the Extreme King.\" Second Uncle's power was stronger than Meng Lie's, but he was not a person who sorted out problems via simple force. He also did not think he could beat that mysterious man in front of him.\n\nAfter listening to Second Uncle, the young man's face broke into an even bigger smile. \"In the eyes of the lowlife creatures, the Extreme King might sound like stalwart allies. For someone like me, through my god eyes, the Extreme Kings of the universe are just as much of lowlives as all the others. They do not have what it takes to negotiate with the likes of me, who is a god.\"\n\nWho is this guy? He is very cocky. He does not spare the Extreme King a second thought. Han Sen did not speak. He just looked at the young man.\n\n\"You are too cocky.\" Second Uncle was furious. There was no way he was going to let the young man's attitude fly.\n\nMany weird shockwaves came out of Second Uncle's body. The shockwaves were shapeless and colorless, but once could see the shockwaves ripple through space. They created a special area for Second Uncle's body.\n\nHan Sen was slightly shocked. The power Second Uncle used seemed to be like a time power. It was a very rare element.\n\n\"Time element? That is very rare, but you are too weak.\" The young man stood up from the stone platform. In the next moment, he was flying toward Second Uncle.\n\nIt was just one step, yet he was already before Second Uncle.\n\nSecond Uncle's eyes had a god light in them. The time power in his body quickly spun. It twisted the space around. It was like the area Han Sen was in. Time was slowing down. Everyone there was moving in slow motion.\n\nEven Bao Qin's screaming had been slowed down many times. His mouth was open, but he could not make a sound for a long time.\n\nPang!\n\nThe young man was not at all affected. His hands pressed down on Second Uncle's head, but Second Uncle's legs went soft. He knelt before the young man.\n\nEverybody was unable to believe what they were seeing. The butterfly Second Uncle, who had a time king body, had been suppressed into a kneel by one hand. How strong was that power?\n\nSecond Uncle was extremely mad. He had never been humiliated like this before. The power in him quickly exploded. He wanted to break the young man's power.\n\nNo matter how he exploded, the young man was still as stable as Tarzan. His hands were still holding onto Second Uncle's head, so that is where Second Uncle continued to kneel.\n\n\"I told you. Your time power element is strong, but you are still too weak for the likes of me. Lowlife creatures really are lowlife creatures. You have powerful element powers, but you can exercise the full potential of such strength.\" The young man was acting like he was teaching a junior. He made Second Uncle's face burn red.\n\nAlthough Second Uncle was angry, he could not break the young man's suppressing power. It made him feel terrible. His anger continued to grow.\n\n\"Let's go!\" Meng Lie roared. He picked up the broken, gold, nine-headed trident. The gold god light on him exploded like a tsunami. It was going toward the young man.\n\nGer, Londo, Bao Qin, Bao Ying, and all the deified elites used their strongest powers. They were all going to attack the young man at the same time. They wanted to use this chance while the young man was dealing with Second Uncle. Now was the time to damage him.\n\nThe young man looked disdained. One of his hands held onto Second Uncle, but he did not move. He shone with a god light. He was like a god light surrounded by a god light from a halo.\n\nPang!\n\nAll kinds of scary powers struck the halo, but they could not break it.\n\n\"Let me give you one last chance. If you still do not listen, your lives are worthless and you don't deserve to live,\" the young man said. His body exploded with god light. It blew away Meng Lie and the other deifieds.\n\nSeeing the deifieds elites that fell, Han Sen was shocked. He thought, Who is this guy? Is he a true god class elite? Why did he disguise himself as me? Is he a friend or foe?"
