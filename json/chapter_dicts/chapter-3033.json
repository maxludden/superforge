    "text": "Han Sen wanted to kill Qin Xiu, but Qin Xiu\u2019s spirit body was extraordinarily tough. Even by using Super Spank at max power, in a short time, he was unable to destroy Qin Xiu\u2019s spirit body. Qin Xiu pulled Han Sen into the crack in time and space. Wan\u2019er, who was next to them, fell inside as well. The three of them kept falling through that weird crack in time and space.\n\nHan Sen noticed his Super God Spirit mode could not stop the weird power of that tunnel. His body was being dissolved.\n\nWhat shocked Han Sen was the fact Qin Xiu did not seem to be affected by the power of the tunnel. He was not dissolving at all.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s golden power could not withstand the reverse tunnel\u2019s weird power. Her body was dissolving too, but at a rate that was faster than Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOf course, The Story of Genes you possess did not succeed. Otherwise, you would not be dissolving in the reverse tunnel\u2019s power.\u201d Qin Xiu let Han Sen go and held onto Wan\u2019er as he spoke.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. This was his last chance to beat him. Qin Xiu was not affected by the reverse tunnel\u2019s power, but Han Sen was affected. If Qin Xiu kept pushing him into the space tunnel, even if Han Sen could kill him, they would die together.\n\n\u201cRemember the promise you made to me,\u201d Qin Xiu said as he stroked Wan\u2019er\u2019s hair and kissed her cheek. \u201cYou will take care of Wan\u2019er. No matter what, ensure she lives happily.\u201d\n\nWith that kiss, the red light of Qin Xiu\u2019s body entered Wan\u2019er. The red light enshrouded Wan\u2019er and kept her inside it. Outside of her body, a red layer stopped the reverse tunnel\u2019s power from destroying her.\n\nBecause of the great loss of power, Qin Xiu\u2019s body grew dim. He appeared and disappeared. His body\u2019s holy light was dissolved by the reverse tunnel. His was becoming dimmer.\n\nHe placed his hands forward and put Wan\u2019er in front of Han Sen. Han Sen collected Wan\u2019er. Qin Xiu smiled at him, but that smile only made people feel sad.\n\n\u201cGo back. Go back to your world. Take Wan\u2019er and live. Perhaps that would be best for her. What has been missed is missed. I cannot try to reclaim it. I, Qin Xiu, cannot go against the sky.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Qin Xiu\u2019s body possessed a red light. His whole body burned with fire. He turned into a red power. He wrapped up Han Sen and Wan\u2019er and pushed back toward the reverse tunnel\u2019s entrance.\n\nAs they got close to the reverse tunnel\u2019s entrance, Qin Xiu\u2019s red fire grew weaker. He used all of his life to become as powerful as possible. When the red fire was extinguished, it would be the official end of Qin Xiu\u2019s life.\n\nSeeing the entrance of the reverse tunnel, Qin Xiu\u2019s red light was already gone. Han Sen used his own power to get out of there.\n\nWhen Han Sen was ready to go out, the Sea of Souls suddenly emitted the sounds of something crying. The very dead crystal armor automatically ran out of the Sea of Souls and wrapped up Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nWhat shocked Han Sen more was that when the black crystal armor was around his body, it went against things. It pulled his body deeper into the reverse tunnel.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Han Sen kept using his power like mad. He wanted to change his course and leave the reverse tunnel, but it was not working. The black crystal kept pulling him down deeper.\n\nNo one answered him. The black crystal armor was silent. It just kept forcing Han Sen to sink deeper. The reverse tunnel\u2019s armor was unable to break the black crystal armor.\n\nInside the reverse tunnel, a weird power surging through the black crystal armor. It kept going into Han Sen\u2019s body. It made his body exhibit weird changes. Han Sen was not sure if the changes were good or bad. With his power, he was not able to stop that power from changing his body.\n\nWan\u2019er had the power Qin Xiu gave her for protection. She did not have changes like that.\n\nThe reverse tunnel was like a bottomless abyss. While Han Sen and Wan\u2019er were sinking, everything seemed to empty. It was like their bodies were consumed by emptiness.\n\nThe first year of the universe\u2019s Dollar calendar.\n\nIn this year, Human Alpha Dollar beat the world\u2019s attempted destroyer and saved the geno universe and its countless denizens. To remember Dollar, who died with the destroyer, that year was named Dollar year one. The new calendar of the universe was started.\n\nHumans and spirits were now members of the geno universe. Countless human elites and spirit elites were from Space Garden and Sacred. It enabled humans and spirits to become important figures in the universe.\n\nWang Yuhang went into the laboratory and asked Xie Qing King, \u201cBrother King, how is your research going? Is there a way for us to access the antimaterial world?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the power of the antimaterial world is too weird,\u201d Xie Qing King said. \u201cWe tried to go through the antimaterial world via Mirror Lake, but no substance was able to endure the antimaterial world\u2019s power.\u201d\n\nQin Xuan arrived holding a record. \u201cFor the past two years, we have tried every way we can to open the antimaterial tunnel. Nothing we have tried has succeeded. The tests fail and fail. We have to find another way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe geno hall\u2019s God must know how to access the antimaterial world, but he will not tell us,\u201d Wang Yuhang sadly said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Qin Xuan said with certainty. \u201cWe know that Han Sen is not dead. If he made it through, it must be possible for us to make it through as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we must find a way to go,\u201d Wang Yuhang said while waving his fists. \u201cWe cannot let little San Mu own the antimaterial world alone.\u201d\n\nZero came from a tunnel, frowned, and asked, \u201cHave you seen Bao\u2019er?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it seems like it has been a while since we last saw her,\u201d Xie Qing King said. \u201cPerhaps she took Little Six and Little Nine to hunt with\n\nher.\u201d\n\nWang Yuhang lifted his lips and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nothing will happen to her in Space Garden. If someone seeks to do something bad to her, whoever it is must be really dumb.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, in a mountain in Space Garden that was inhabited by nobody, Bao\u2019er was standing atop a weird bronze item. She looked at the bronze item. The bronze item was Han Sen\u2019s Four Sheep Cube.\n\nNext to Bao\u2019er was a fortune-telling old man who was holding a flag. The words \u201cCounting all the destinies\u201d were on the flag. It was just those four big words.\n\nBao\u2019er blinked. She stared at the fortune-telling old man and asked, \u201cCan this thing really take me to my father?\u201d \u201cOf course. I swear to God and hope to die that I would not lie about this.\u201d The fortune-telling old man swore to God."
