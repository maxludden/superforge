    "text": "\"Who told you about the protection mechanism?\" Yang Manli stared at Han Sen madly. Of course, she knew about this trick.\n\n\"What protection mechanism? I do not understand what you are talking about?\" Han Sen looked innocent.\n\n\"You won\u2019t tell? Go get a 7.0 practice bow and some arrows,\" Yang Manli calmed down and said coldly.\n\nHan Sen did not know what she wanted to do, and did what she asked.\n\n\"You know the standard stance to draw the string?\" Yang Manli looked at Han Sen and asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Han Sen nodded.\n\n\"Very good, pull the string to the fullest on standard stance,\" Yang Manli said quietly.\n\nHan Sen had worked hard on archery so his stance was perfect and he easily pulled the string to the fullest.\n\n\"Good stance.\" Han Sen was surprised to hear Yang Manli\u2019s compliment.\n\n\"Thank you, Captain.\" Still, Han Sen knew he was in trouble.\n\n\"Hold this position until midnight. If you move during this period and I do not get the answer I want, you do not need to show up here again. Even if the stationmaster came here herself, one of us must go.\" Yang Manli turned to leave.\n\nSeeing Yang going away, the soldiers ran back and the one who told Han Sen about the protection mechanism felt guilty and said, \"Sorry buddy, I did not expect Yang to be onto you. I did you harm instead of good.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s just a few hours. I\u2019ll be fine.\" Han Sen said casually.\n\n\"Do not underestimate the standard stance. Twenty minutes was all right, but two hours is just torture. A 7.0 bow is not a joke, usually we can\u2019t even last two hours with a 6.0 bow. It\u2019s four hours until midnight. Yang is really brutal this time.\"\n\n\"I say let\u2019s go apologize. Just tell her we all told him about the loophole. Or else he would probably not be able to use his arms ever again.\"\n\n\"If we have to. Judging from her look, we would suffer as well.\"\n\nThe soldiers complained and sighed.\n\n\"No need. I\u2019ll give it a shot. My endurance has always been good. Four hours, I think there should be no problem.\" Han Sen called the soldiers who were going to apologize back.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter how good your endurance is. It\u2019s torture.\"\n\nHan Sen smiled, \"I\u2019ve seen worse. Don\u2019t go yet. If I can\u2019t do it, you could go then. Maybe by then Yang Manli will see how miserable I am and lessen the punishment.\"\n\n\"That is also true. Buddy, you hang in there first. Let us know when it gets bad. We will go and confess.\" The soldiers were loyal.\n\nHen Sen nodded and did not speak. Remaining motionless was sometimes even worse than violent movement, especially when he was also drawing a 7.0 bow.\n\nIn the beginning he didn\u2019t feel much, but after half an hour, his arm muscles began to feel numb, and with the passage of time, this numb feeling was more and more intense.\n\nIn just an hour, Han Sen was sweating like rain, his arms burning and whole body trembling.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and started to practice Jadeskin. A spring-like coolness flowed through all his veins, where the numb feeling was gradually relieved.\n\nThrough the monitor, Yang Manli would glance at Han Sen from time to time. She saw him keeping the stance but started to tremble when it was approaching an hour. His endurance was already beyond her expectation. Even the soldiers can only last this long.\n\nYang Manli predicted he could last about at most one and a half hours, certainly less than two hours.\n\n\"Cheating in your first training session. I have to put you through hell.\" Yang Manli did not really want a name from Han Sen. His silence was a quality she could appreciate and if he had confessed about the person who had told him, she would have looked down on him.\n\nAfter working for a while, Yang Manli checked on him again when it was an hour and a half, and found he was still standing there.\n\nYang Manli could not help but frown, as Han Sen looked better now than half an hour ago. He had stopped trembling and was sweating less. In general, he looked more relaxed.\n\n\"He moved?\" Yang Manli was not sure and played the footage backward, noticing Han Sen had not moved in the last 30 minutes.\n\n\"Odd!\" Yang Manli did not go back to work, but paid full attention to Han Sen's image.\n\nHan Sen had been standing for two hours.\n\n\"Buddy, you're awesome. Can you keep going?\"\n\n\"Your endurance is out of this world. If you are this good in every aspect, you could definitely go to the Alliance Central Military Academy.\"\n\n\"Brother, you a real man!\" A soldier gave him a thumbs-up.\n\n\"Let us know if you can\u2019t keep going. Don\u2019t risk hurting your own body. It\u2019s not worth it.\"\n\nKeeping his body motionless, Han Sen smiled and said, \"I feel okay. I can definitely hold until midnight. No need to check on me.\"\n\n\"Brother, if you can really hold until midnight, you will be under my protection in the future.\"\n\n\"Your protection? Do you dare to fight Yang or Qin Xuan?\"\n\n\"Ahem, I was just saying. Do not be so serious.\"\n\nThe soldiers took a shower and went to the cafeteria, leaving Han Sen alone in the gym. He was practicing Jadeskin secretly and felt its power welling from every body cell, eliminating his fatigue.\n\nWhen Han Sen had insisted for three hours, even Yang Manli was shocked. She even doubted if the soldiers had hacked the monitor and all she saw was a loop.\n\nSoon she ruled out that possibility and left the office for the gym."
