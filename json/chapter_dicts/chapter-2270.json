    "text": "The steel twig was unexpectedly tough. It took Han Sen a long while to cut through it so he could claim the silver fruit for himself.\n\nWhen he finally sawed through the twig, the silver fruit dropped from the tree. Han Sen reached out his hand to grab it. But the moment the silver sycee touched his hand, Han Sen\u2019s eyes widened.\n\nHis face twisted, and his muscles trembled and shook. His blood surged through his veins like lightning, and his entire body turned to ice jade. He roared. He struggled to raise the hand that was holding the silver sycee, his other hand clutching his waist as if he was about to have a hernia.\n\nHan Sen summoned all the power he could. His hair flew around like mad, and green veins bulged across his head.\n\nPatong!\n\nThe silver sycee continued to fall to the ground, taking Han Sen\u2019s hand with it. Han Sen had to half-kneel on the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of fruit is this? It is so heavy! If I swallowed this, it would tear straight through my stomach!\u201d Han Sen stared at the fruit in disbelief. He wanted to get his hand out from under it, but it was pinning his hand down. He pulled away with all his might, but the fruit wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nHan Sen took out his knife and hacked away at the silver fruit. The loud shrieking noise of metal on metal assaulted his ears, but the sycee remained completely undamaged. The fruit was harder than the tree it had come from.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Han Sen decided to dig into the ground instead. The floor of the palace was also incredibly hard, though. Han Sen\u2019s cuts only left light scrape marks behind.\n\nThe blood kirin used its own claws to help dig through the stone near Han Sen\u2019s hand. The creature actually managed to leave a few proper scratch marks, but whenever it pulled its claws away, the scratch marks would disappear.\n\nThe blood kirin kept digging, but the floor continued to miraculously recover. Han Sen\u2019s hand remained motionless under the silver sycee.\n\n\u201cGrab that fruit and lift it away!\u201d Han Sen barked to the blood kirin when he realized that digging into the floor was a futile endeavor.\n\nThe blood kirin, upon hearing Han Sen, locked its jaws around the silver sycee. It yanked upward with all of its might, but the silver sycee remained still.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what is this thing\u2026\u201d Han Sen was frozen. It was just a fruit, but not even a half-deified being could move it. The sycee didn\u2019t even twitch.\n\nEven more strangely, Han Sen\u2019s hand hadn\u2019t been crushed. The sycee was keeping him pinned in place, but if the fruit was really as heavy as it seemed, his hand should have been crushed and broken.\n\nIn truth, his hand was only suffering a bit of pressure. It definitely hadn\u2019t been injured.\n\nJust as Han Sen was about to use Purple-Eye Butterfly to take a look at the fruit, the teleporter rippled with movement. Someone was coming.\n\nHan Sen looked over as Mister White and Crime emerged. Their presence made him frown.\n\nAlthough Crime was King class instead of half-deified, Han Sen had witnessed his talents in battle. He was no worse than the half-deified Edward, by Han Sen\u2019s estimation.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, what are you doing?\u201d Mister White looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\nThe blood kirin interrupted his question with a roar. Then, it leaped towards Mister White and Crime. Its claws wielded a blood air as they slashed as Mister White like blades.\n\nMister White stepped forward like he was teleporting. He appeared right beside the blood kirin and pressed a hand against the creature\u2019s head.\n\nMister White\u2019s hand flashed with a strange symbol. That symbol sank into the scaled forehead of the blood kirin like a brand.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe blood kirin\u2019s body suddenly became heavier, and the increased weight almost took the creature to its knees.\n\nThe symbol glowed gently from the creature\u2019s forehead, and the blood kirin seemed to struggle against the encumbrance.\n\nThe blood kirin roared and jumped towards Mister White again, but this time, it was far slower. Mister White moved with eerie grace, and every step looked like he was teleporting. His power was similar to Huangfu Jing\u2019s. He was far stronger than her, of course.\n\nThe blood kirin continued to chase Mister White, all the while roaring in rage. It was angry at being tricked, and even more furious that it was unable to bring harm to Mister White. Mister White had played it for a fool.\n\n\u201cThe blood kirin\u2019s intelligence really is quite low.\u201d Han Sen sighed. The beast had plenty of brawn, but it was severely lacking in the brains department.\n\nMister White lured the blood kirin to a side hall, and Han Sen could do nothing to stop him. Meanwhile, Crime headed for the pinned-down Han Sen. He looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cWe have no grudge with you. Give me the stone plate, and we will leave. We will pretend we did not see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome and get it, if you have what it takes,\u201d Han Sen replied flatly.\n\n\u201cYou are strong, but regrettably, the fruit seems to be holding you in place quite easily. You can\u2019t escape as you are right now. How do you expect to fight me?\u201d Crime drew his knife.\n\nThey had paid the price of underestimating Han Sen before, but now, Crime considered him to be an equal opponent. Crime and Mister White were not going to underestimate him anymore because he was a Duke. Even though Han Sen\u2019s hand was held firmly in place, which left him unable to run, Crime was still going to use all his power when he attacked.\n\nCrime\u2019s knife was very creepy, although it was only one foot long. It was made of black metal, and the blade was shorter than the handle. It looked like the blade had been broken.\n\nA ring protruded from the base of the handle, and a chain was attached firmly to the ring. The other end of the chain connected to Crime\u2019s strong arm.\n\nAs Crime slashed toward him, Han Sen didn\u2019t speak. He simply tapped the bird\u2019s nest on his head, and it widened to shield Han Sen\u2019s entire body.\n\nThe bird\u2019s nest caught Crime\u2019s strike and reflected it in complete silence. No sound was heard, and the nest remained perfectly intact.\n\nCrime was surprised. He gathered up all his power and slashed a few more times. Nothing he tried seemed to work, though.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t worried that Crime would break the bird\u2019s nest. Even Fox Queen hadn\u2019t been able to damage that thing. There was no way Crime could do what she could not.\n\nIt was a shame the bird\u2019s nest couldn\u2019t be used offensively. However, he was currently more frustrated by his inability to get the fruit off of his hand.\n\nHan Sen tried a few different powers, but nothing seemed to work. Aside from using his super god spirit body, he didn\u2019t seem to have many options.\n\nSuddenly, Mister White\u2019s voice came from the side hall. \u201cHan Sen, if things continue like this, none of us will benefit. Why don\u2019t we try to cooperate?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Han Sen asked after a moment.\n\n\u201cMake this blood kirin stop, firstly. At least then we might be able to talk,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Han Sen called the blood kirin back to his side. Mister White also removed the mark he had placed upon the creature\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cHow about this: I\u2019ll help you escape, and in return, you\u2019ll give me the stone plate,\u201d Mister White said while looking at Han Sen."
