    "text": "Yu Shanxin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t fluctuate in the slightest after hearing Han Sen\u2019s speech. He asked calmly, \u201cHave you heard the tale of the Sky alpha known as Suppress Demon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t in the mood for a story, but if someone like Yu Shanxin wanted to talk, then Han Sen would listen.\n\nYu Shanxin\u2019s smooth voice remained just loud enough for Han Sen to hear him. \u201cIn ancient times, before the interstellar area, the Sky lived on a planet where a demon also resided. It ate people. The demon would eat one person every day. But the demon didn\u2019t have its own body. If it wanted to eat someone, it would have to possess the body of one Sky to devour the body of another.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they were unable to prevent the demon from possessing them, the Sky had many incidents involving fathers eating their sons, wives eating husbands, or even children eating their grandparents. Those things continued to happen until our alpha rose to the challenge. He offered himself to the demon and allowed the demon to assume control of his body.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd? Did the Sky alpha somehow imprison the demon?\u201d Han Sen was curious.\n\n\u201cNo. Our alpha\u2019s power wasn\u2019t vastly superior to that of the average Sky. The demon gained control of his body, too. The demon used him to eat many Sky,\u201d Yu Shanxin said flatly. That answer wasn\u2019t what Han Sen had expected.\n\nYu Shanxin looked at Han Sen and went on to say, \u201cAlthough our alpha was controlled by the demon, he managed to accomplish something more than most possessed Sky. Other Sky, when they were controlled by the demon, still had their will. But they didn\u2019t hate the demon. They were scared of it like a tiger. Even if they pretended not to be, they couldn\u2019t lie to the demon. That was because when the demon possessed a Sky, it could peer into their thoughts. No matter what that person did, they couldn\u2019t lie to the demon. So, it didn\u2019t matter what they said or did. The demon would still see into their thoughts. The demon would control them and force them to kill themselves. The alpha was the only exception to this.\u201d\n\nuse\n\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Han Sen had become very curious.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. He befriended the demon,\u201d Yu Shanxin said.\n\n\u201cI thought you said the demon could see through the thoughts of the Sky. How could the alpha trick a demon like that?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion. The Sky\u2019s alpha must have hated the demon.\n\nYu Shanxin laughed and said, \u201cThat is why Master Alpha was different. He faced an enemy that he hated the most, yet he was able to let go of that anger and treat the demon so kindly. It was as if he considered the demon to be his own son, and no matter how much the demon did wrong, he still forgave it. That was a care that came from the heart. In this universe, aside from my alpha, I have yet to see anyone be able to do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying the kindness of Master Alpha touched that demon?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t guess the ending of this story, so this was his best attempt.\n\n\u201cYes. Master Alpha\u2019s kindness had an impact on the demon. That demon was only supposed to possess someone for a single day before disposing of the host. But when it entered the alpha\u2019s body, it remained there. It never left him, until Master Alpha found a weakness inside the demon and killed it. He ended the nightmare that had plagued the Sky for as long as my people could remember,\u201d Yu Shanxin said.\n\nHan Sen was blown away by this story. The alpha had used love to earn the trust of a demon that could read peoples\u2019 minds, and then killed the demon he had grown to love. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what sort of person could do that. If he had been in the alpha\u2019s place, Han Sen didn\u2019t think he could have achieved the same.\n\n\u201cTeacher Yu, your alpha is a real saint. I\u2019m just a normal man. Do you want me to go feed a demon? I can\u2019t do it. I would be angered by the Very High, and I would likely end up dead.\u201d Han Sen understood what Yu Shanxin meant by telling him the story, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t do it. Understanding didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t do it. I can help you,\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile.\n\n\u201cReally? You can help with this?\u201d Han Sen asked skeptically. He thought Yu Shanxin must have been yanking his chain.\n\nYu Shanxin laughed and said, \u201cDo you know why my name is Yu Shanxin?\u201d.\u201cHow am I supposed to know something like that?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. But what he said was, \u201cI have heard your temper got better when you received this name, Mr. Yu. Was it to make you think more positive things?\u201d\n\nYu Shanxin smiled and said, \u201cI thank you for thinking so highly of me, but I don\u2019t really have positive thoughts. The reason why I am called Yu Shanxin is to tell myself that no matter what happens, I should never give up on myself. It doesn\u2019t matter if I become evil or commit a crime no one else can accept. It doesn\u2019t matter how much I am hated; at the very least, I can avoid hating myself. I need a good heart to love myself with.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was frozen. This was the first time he had ever heard someone explain their good heart to someone else.\n\n\u201cThe geno arts I practice are based on evil powers. If I think of evil things, they will be more powerful. When I was younger, the reason I came to Sky Palace to kill the elders was precisely because of this. But the stronger this geno art becomes, the more it claims me. I didn\u2019t practice the skills of killing; I trained the mental fortitude of not allowing myself to ever be claimed by evil. Only I can control myself in this world. No one else can use me. Not even God.\u201d Yu Shanxin was speaking so quietly, but Han Sen could feel the overbearing weight of the man\u2019s words.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t understand how this conversation had anything to do with the Very High.\n\nYu Shanxin looked at Han Sen and smiled. \u201cThe Extreme Evil Path I have practiced doesn\u2019t have a sensing power like the Very High, but it does contain a unique ability. I can use my evil to possess you. And when the Very High use their senses to invade your mind, they will only touch the evil of my mind. And so, all they will feel are my feelings. It will mean that they cannot feel anything about you. That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about their invasive senses. You can enjoy all the benefits of the Very High without having to worry about being watched. Would you reject a swathe of benefits like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can really do that?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t doubt what Yu Shanxin was saying, despite how far-fetched it seemed. Still, he felt compelled to ask.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, we can conduct a test. Meet Exquisite from the Very High, and then you can find out if I\u2019m telling the truth or not,\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile."
