    "text": "Wan\u2019er struck too fast for Han Sen to dodge. His fast reflexes moved his head far enough back that she didn\u2019t strike him directly, but her fingertips still tore into his face.\n\nThree deep gashes were torn into Han Sen\u2019s face. The clefts were so deep that his skull became visible through them.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He was still in his super god spirit body mode, but Wan\u2019er\u2019s fingers had damaged him anyway. This was the first time something of the sort had ever happened.\n\nLuckily, he managed to dodge most of her attack. Otherwise, his entire head would have split open like a cut watermelon.\n\nHan Sen instinctually started to return to the sanctuaries. His super god spirit body couldn\u2019t block Wan\u2019er\u2019s power if she chose to attack him again, so he couldn\u2019t escape by traditional means if she wanted to fight him.\n\nBut Wan\u2019er didn\u2019t attack him again. She stood where she was, unmoving. She looked at the blood on her fingers, which was Han Sen\u2019s blood.\n\nA little life came back to her eyes, and her golden power began to fade.\n\n\u201cDo we affect each other?\u201d Han Sen thought happily. He gritted his teeth and grabbed Wan\u2019er\u2019s arm. He examined her.\n\nAs Wan\u2019er\u2019s body came closer to Han Sen, her gold color faded much faster.\n\nWhen he saw that Wan\u2019er wasn\u2019t resisting, Han Sen pulled her into his arms. When their bodies were in physical contact, Wan\u2019er\u2019s golden power vanished completely. Her eyes looked fully cognizant for the first time.\n\n\u201cGood brother, it\u2019s so nice to have you here,\u201d Wan\u2019er mumbled against Han Sen\u2019s chest. She was lying forward against him, and she slowly closed her eyes.\n\nAfter she spoke, Wan\u2019er\u2019s body went soft. Her consciousness drifted away as it had before.\n\nHan Sen frowned and looked at the girl in his arms. Her lifeforce was weaker than it had been the previous time, when she was in a coma. Now, her lifeforce was like that of a dying old woman. She no longer had the vitality of a teenage lady.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean that using the golden power costs her the strength of her lifeforce?\u201d Han Sen looked at the lady thoughtfully as a variety of emotions shifted across her expression.\n\nThis girl was the only person Han Sen had ever encountered who could threaten him in his super god spirit body mode. It might have been a good idea to get rid of her, but there were so many unknowns about the girl. A lot of questions had been raised by her existence, and she did seem to harbor some sort of connection to Han Sen. He really, really needed to figure out what was going on here.\n\n\u201cAs long as she is next to me, she can\u2019t make use of that scary power. So, I suppose I don\u2019t have to be too afraid. I need to figure out what she is before I do anything drastic.\u201d Han Sen sighed, set the girl down, and then looked across the hall.\n\nThe hall had only been home to the statue, and Han Sen looked around for a while, but he didn\u2019t find anything useful there. And the materials that composed the hall were too tough to be broken through, so Han Sen couldn\u2019t search any further.\n\nHan Sen did find a piece of red crystal that was around the size of his hand, though. It was inside the remains of the red eyeball. He put it in his pocket, then went back the way he had come.\n\n\u201cNow that the statue has been destroyed, I wonder if the red-eye condition is still in effect.\u201d Han Sen went back the way he had come to take a look.\n\nBut when he reached the place that he had left Miss Mirror, he didn\u2019t see her there.\n\n\u201cDid she go back to camp? That really isn\u2019t her style.\u201d Han Sen frowned, then began walking a little faster.\n\nEven if the red-eye power infecting Miss Mirror had vanished, she wouldn\u2019t simply go home. She would have stayed where she was and waited for Han Sen to return so she could grill him thoroughly over what had happened.\n\nPlus, the pieces of the shattered tree egg were still lying around. If Miss Mirror had decided to leave, she would have at least taken the pieces of the tree egg with her. They were a valuable treasure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that she is gone, then. That means all of these tree egg shards are mine.\u201d Han Sen picked up a piece and started to put it away. As he did, he noticed how nice the chunk of egg smelled. But there didn\u2019t seem to be any lifeforce within the pieces of egg. And furthermore, there was no semblance of power. This definitely wasn\u2019t what Han Sen had expected.\n\n\u201cNo wonder Miss Mirror left these behind. They\u2019re already useless. Did Wan\u2019er absorb the powers of the tree egg while she was inside it?\u201d Han Sen guessed. He couldn\u2019t think of any other explanations.\n\nHan Sen kept walking back the way he had come. He didn\u2019t encounter any more trouble. Wan\u2019er was still in her coma, and her body was so weak that it looked like the final tether of her life would break at any second.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know why the girl had been reduced to such a condition. If this continued, she wouldn\u2019t last long.\n\nStrangely, though, Han Sen found no evidence of the wall of pictures on his return trip. The wall seemed to have just vanished into thin air, without a trace.\n\nHan Sen continued walking back toward camp, and when the first statue came into view, he froze. Miss Mirror was lying in front of the statue, and a woman was kneeling beside her. The woman was praying to the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes. It was one of the four Kings. It was Red Cloud.\n\nThe scene before him was the same as the sixth picture depicted on the screen\u2019s mural. It gave Han Sen a chill.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Han Sen was confused. He looked at Red Cloud and Miss Mirror, unsure what was happening.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s presence was still there. She wasn\u2019t dead, but she seemed to be badly wounded as she lay on the ground. She obviously wasn\u2019t doing well.\n\nRed Cloud knelt before the statue like a sincere believer. Her eyes were closed and her hands were folded as she prayed.\n\n\u201cNo way! Red Cloud never saw the statue. And didn\u2019t Miss Mirror tell her to watch over the base? Why is she here? Did the red-eye power become contagious? That means Bao\u2019er and Ning Yue are in danger.\u201d Anxiety grew in the pit of Han Sen\u2019s stomach, and he started jogging forward.\n\nBefore Han Sen reached the statue, Red Cloud opened her eyes. Her eyes were the color of blood, and they contained two pupils each. That was the look people had when they were stricken with the power of the Blood Eye Evil God.\n\nUpon seeing Han Sen, Red Cloud looked murderous. She picked up the broken sword, but instead of striking Han Sen, she turned and thrust the broken blade into Miss Mirror\u2019s chest.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped, and he used his Jadeskin Area to freeze Red Cloud.\n\nRed Cloud was only King class, so she was unable to defeat Han Sen. The red-eye powers were running through her too strongly for her to know what she was doing. She couldn\u2019t block Han Sen\u2019s power, and so she ended up frozen.\n\nHan Sen walked up to Miss Mirror. He crouched, looked at her, and smiled.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror, why are you lying around at a time like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your sword to break the statue,\u201d Miss Mirror said quietly through gritted teeth. Her eyes were still a deep red.\n\nHan Sen could feel that the statue still had that red-eye power, but it wasn\u2019t as strong as the statue Wan\u2019er had destroyed earlier. It didn\u2019t make him want to run deep into the city. It just wanted him to go to the statue itself.\n\nClearly, although the Blood Eye Evil God had been killed, this statue still had some of that Blood Eye Evil God power."
