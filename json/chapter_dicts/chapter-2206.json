    "text": "Over the past few centuries, the Extreme King had put much of their focus on the systems of chaos. The Ice Blue Knights were pioneers, and their primary killing fields were those dangerous systems. They knew little about matters concerning other places in the universe. Because of this, they were unaware of who Han Sen was.\n\nThe Extreme King did have an information gathering department, so they did know a thing or two about Han Sen. But the Extreme King thought only people like Moon Wheel King or Yisha were worth focusing on. Not many people knew Night River King, at all. The only people that cared for that sort of information were the locals of Narrow Moon.\n\nIce Blue Knight King only knew that Yisha had a student. He didn\u2019t know that person\u2019s name or race. He had just assumed that her student would be a Rebate, not a crystallizer.\n\nIce Blue Knight King didn\u2019t say much to Han Sen, and he simply encouraged him to engage in the test.\n\nAlthough Ice Blue Knight King really admired Knife Queen, he wouldn\u2019t go easy on her student. To gain his approval, Han Sen would have to demonstrate an appropriately impressive amount of power.\n\nBut because of his experience with Yisha, Ice Blue Knight King remained hopeful that Han Sen would succeed.\n\n\u201cMister White, what do you think about Knife\u2019s student?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King looked at a man in green clothing standing beside him.\n\nThe man squinted as he peered at Han Sen and said, \u201cHe is an interesting man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, after all, the student of Knife Queen should be at least half-decent. If he wasn\u2019t, he would not have been selected by a woman like her,\u201d Ice Blue Knight said with absolute confidence.\n\nThe green-clothed Mister White didn\u2019t answer. He merely smiled and kept his eyes on the test.\n\nHan Sen was in the Marquise queue. He was watching the Kings perform their test, thinking of a way in which he might get himself disqualified without looking like he was intentionally throwing the test.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t want to go to the Extreme King; it was just that he had many problems already in Narrow Moon. Leaving Han Meng\u2019er there alone with Night River King would be a risky thing to do.\n\nHan Sen wanted to take out Night River King before he left Narrow Moon. So, Han Sen planned to stay.\n\nAfter watching for a while, Han Sen had an idea of how he might sneak his way past the test. The most annoying thing, though, would be the geno tree test.\n\nThat test was way too straightforward. The flowers opened up in accordance with how much power one had. People could see the results easily.\n\nHan Sen was far stronger than the average Marquise. Even if he performed poorly in the other tests, dropping some blood on the tree would guarantee a flower boom that far exceeded anyone else there. Cheating on the other tests would be rendered pointless.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen had a way to deal with the tree, so he wasn\u2019t too worried.\n\nWhen it was almost Han Sen\u2019s turn, Night River King cockily said, \u201cHa, now he has to go. That means I have Cold Palace all to myself.\u201d\n\nThe tests at each level were different. A Marquise\u2019s first challenge was a combat test. He had to fight and defeat a machine robot. That robot had been created by a Duke knight. Its strength would be Marquise level, so it would adequately test combat skills at that rank.\n\nThe scoring system went up to one hundred, and if you wanted to pass, you\u2019d have to beat the ninety-point mark. The tests would continue even if the examinee failed one, though. Each test would have to be gone through for proper evaluation.\n\nPeople that performed some tests poorly could still be selected.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s level of power, the people of Narrow Moon thought he could defeat the machine with great ease.\n\nBut when Han Sen started to fight, the mouths of all the Kings were left wide open. Moon Wheel King himself was particularly shocked.\n\nLit! F*cking lit!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fight with the doll was like the greatest fight of all time. If the audience hadn\u2019t known Han Sen\u2019s real power, they\u2019d have been very moved.\n\nHan Sen seemed like someone who had fantastic endurance, but not enough strength. He kept on fighting and fighting, even if he failed. He worked his way against the enemy without any fear of how difficult it might be. While Han Sen would bleed, he would not cry. And eventually, he did defeat his foe. He won the fight. It was just done in a movie-like way that was sure to encourage others.\n\nWhen Han Sen beat the robot, many lovely female Nobles had tears in their eyes. They almost shouted out, \u201cHan Sen, you are the best!\u201d\n\nBut the people in Narrow Moon who actually knew Han Sen had strange expressions on their faces.\n\nHan Sen was a man who treated Night River King like an annoying dog. He had beaten Dragons. He was regarded as being on the same level as Lone Bamboo. But now, seeing him struggle to fight a mere Marquise robot made the onlookers think that something was wrong with their eyes.\n\n\u201c*sshole! That *sshole! This is too much!\u201d Night River King seethed as he watched Han Sen\u2019s performance. But then he calmed himself down. \u201cYes, keep acting. Let\u2019s see if you can trick the geno tree into blooming with fewer flowers.\u201d\n\nAs he watched the fight, Ice Blue Knight King frowned. He asked Moon Wheel King, \u201cIs he really Knife Queen\u2019s student?\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King coughed and smiled. \u201cHe has just become a Marquise. So, he is not in his best shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe works hard, but he is grossly underpowered. How did Knife teach him?\u201d After seeing Han Sen use Teeth Knife, Ice Blue Knight King thought his performance of it was terrible.\n\n\u201cUm, Knife was busy much of the time. She sent him to Sky Palace for a while\u2026\u201d Moon Wheel King felt depressed.\n\nIce Blue Knight King stopped his line of questioning. He watched Han Sen\u2019s performance and concluded that Knife must have had her reasons for taking Han Sen as a student. He believed Han Sen must have been strong in another way.\n\nThe tests of the Extreme King were very scientific, and they could accurately gauge anyone\u2019s potential. The tests could show the extent of a person\u2019s talents. But Han Sen\u2019s performances were driving the people of Narrow Moon nuts.\n\nThey knew some of Han Sen\u2019s true abilities. They knew how scary he could be, but now, he looked like a man that worked hard and had no real talent.\n\nHe worked very hard, but his results were terrible.\n\nMoon Wheel King\u2019s expression was becoming increasingly strained. It was difficult to avoid laughing when looking at his pinched face.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Knife didn\u2019t have a replacement.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King sighed. Han Sen seemed well-behaved, and it looked like he worked very hard. His talents, however, were downright terrible.\n\nNight River King only laughed at Han Sen coldly, without saying a word. He wanted to see how Han Sen planned to make it past the geno tree.\n\nThe results given by the geno tree were always accurate, so his act wouldn\u2019t pay off. Taking the geno tree test would reveal the true extent of his power. Perhaps it would make Ice Blue Knight King angry."
