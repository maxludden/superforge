    "text": "On Planet Roca, seven creatures dressed in black were hovering in the air above Han Sen\u2019s house. They were watching.\n\n\u201cYake, you are being too careful. It is only the Han family, and we aren\u2019t even certain they are descended from Han Jinzhi. Even if they were, you wouldn\u2019t need me and Rudy here. And here we are, alongside Buck,\u201d Gugia said to Yake.\n\nYake\u2019s gaze was directed at Han Manor. He saw Ji Yanran, Zero, Bao\u2019er, and Stay Up Late all eating food together in the garden.\n\n\u201cBe careful. Snake Witch, Black Tiger, and Lou Jia all died. Maybe Han Jinzhi is still protecting them. Our opponent is not Han Sen, after all. It is Han Jinzhi.\u201d After Yake said this, he talked to a man with white hair. \u201cNew Community Leader, how are you doing?\u201d\n\nHan Yufei, who had become the New Community Leader, calmly said, \u201cThe New Community has cut off all connections between Planet Roca and the galaxy outside. For the next two days, no one in the Alliance will be able to help this planet. I am not sure about the Ji family, but they won\u2019t receive word of any suspicious activity for at least three hours. We have cordoned off the area, as well, not allowing any other human to approach the airspace.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Thank you,\u201d Yake said coldly. Then he turned to Buck and another three creatures. \u201cDo it. Handle the Han family. Han Sen and his son must be taken alive, but do with the others as you deem necessary. Me, Rudy, and Gugia will deal with Han Jinzhi or any other elites that show up. You will go in unopposed and undisturbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Buck and the other creatures heard what was said, and then flew down into the garden.\n\nThey were all members of God\u2019s Organization, but there was a hierarchy and tiering between them. The geno armors that God\u2019s Organization possessed all had limitations. The members had to be approved and authorized to make use of an armor before donning one. Yake, Rudy, and Gugia were of a higher tier.\n\nBuck and the others were still in training after becoming gods. They did not have self-geno armor, and they could not be approved. So, their tier was lower. But the creatures that could level up to reach the Alliance were very powerful, of course. And they were very proud of their accomplishments.\n\nIf Han Jinzhi was there, or any other geno armor elites, they would be afraid.\n\nBut in the garden, all they could see were a bunch of youngsters. They did not think they\u2019d have much trouble dealing with them. After all, they had been in the top of the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary in their time there. Some referred to them as actual Gods.\n\nLuo Lan was having food with the family at the table. Golden Growler, who looked like a lion-dog, suddenly stood up and roared to the sky.\n\nHan Sen and Ji Yanran knew Golden Growler wouldn\u2019t just randomly bark or howl, so they looked up.\n\nA fiery dragon came swooping down. It was over a hundred meters long, carried by swathes of red and blue flame. When it got in close, it brightened everything.\n\nTo the left of the dragon was a monster with four wings. It had black scales. It was not as large as the dragon, but it was still ten meters long. On the right of it was an icy eagle. The wings of the creature were twenty meters long, and it came down shrouded in a snowstorm of its own creation.\n\nThe three creatures covered the entire city. The building where the Han family lived suffered the brunt of that frightening aura.\n\nLuo Lan and Ji Yanran\u2019s faces paled slightly. These attackers were stronger than demi-gods, so needless to say, they were scared quite a bit.\n\nBuck and the others hadn\u2019t been approved to wear geno armor, and neither did they have their own self geno armor. But still, they had been in the Alliance for many years. Their fitness was far better than the top demi-gods.\n\nHumans did not have many top-ranking demi-gods. Aside from Luo Haitang, the others were just gemstone class. And that was still a ways from Buck\u2019s strength.\n\nAmidst Luo Lan\u2019s fear, she heard a loud noise. Golden Growler\u2019s body was expanding, and immediately, he went flying up towards Buck and the others.\n\nHe was getting bigger in the air, like a mountain. And on top of that, he was wearing a gold set of armor. The fire dragon Buck looked like a lizard in front of the giant Golden Growler. The other two were tinier than that.\n\nGolden Growler brought his gaping maw towards Buck as the dragon swung its talons defensively. But Golden Growler\u2019s teeth came down on his neck and broke it. Blood cascaded down like a waterfall.\n\nGolden Growler was using a geno armor to bully the would-be assaulters coming down from the sky. He ripped the three God-class creatures apart in no time. They were bleeding all over, shocking all who witnessed the act.\n\nLuo Lan and Ji Yanran were stunned by the sight, as they hadn\u2019t expected Golden Growler to be that strong.\n\nStay Up Late observed Golden Growler\u2019s geno armor and squinted in thought.\n\nYake, Rudy, and Gugia were shocked, too. They were waiting for other elites to back the family up, and they never suspected the dog-looking creature at the table was the one they feared. Golden Growler had managed to kill Buck and severely damage the other two creatures in no time at all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so wrong! An elite with geno armor pretending to be a simple pet dog. Oh, I am going to kill it!\u201d Gugia roared. He flew in front of Golden Growler and stopped him from finishing off the other two.\n\nGugia looked like a human, but he had a third eye in his forehead. He was wearing white geno armor when he swooped down to go against Golden Growler.\n\nBoom!\n\nGolden Growler slapped Gugia, and he was sent rolling a few thousand miles. His face looked glum, and he immediately acknowledged that he was no match for Golden Growler\u2019s strength."
