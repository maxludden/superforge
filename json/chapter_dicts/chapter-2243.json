    "text": "Han Sen looked around the cave, but he couldn\u2019t find another exit. He wasn\u2019t in much of a rush, though. He released Little Star from Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\n\u201cLittle Star, let\u2019s see how you do here.\u201d Han Sen leaped atop Little Star.\n\n\u201cOokini Ookini!\u201d Little Star bellowed. Starlight began to glow softly from its form as its body\u2014and Han Sen\u2019s\u2014started to become transparent. Then, it raced into the stone.\n\nLittle Star had only been gone for ten minutes when Edward appeared in the mouth of the cave. After he entered, he had a look around.\n\n\u201cNot here?\u201d Edward frowned. He was confident in the logical process that had led him there. It took him by surprise when Han Sen was nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cThis guy is a lot of trouble to deal with. Every creature leaves traces of their presence, even if it is only a couple of molecules. He hasn\u2019t left behind anything, however. How has he managed to do something like that?\u201d Edward frowned as he continued poking around.\n\nAlthough he hadn\u2019t found Han Sen, Edward felt certain that his quarry had indeed entered this cave.\n\n\u201cMy lead comes to a dead-end here. It looks as if I will have to find him by another means,\u201d Edward observed to himself, looking around the nest. He looked at one of the walls and then took his leave.\n\nWith Little Star\u2019s help, Han Sen had traveled directly through the stone. Together, they must have gone at least a few hundred miles before reaching another underground cave.\n\nHan Sen let Little Star rest for a bit while he went to look around the cave.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Edward will be able to find me anytime soon, but regardless, I cannot emerge just yet. I need to find out what is so special about that stone plate.\u201d Han Sen looked around. That cavern they had found was a segment of a complicated subterranean complex.\n\nThat area was devoid of xenogeneics, so Han Sen settled in to rest for a while. As he leaned back against a comfortable outcropping of stone, he thought about how he might proceed.\n\n\u201cThe stone plate seems to be something of tremendous value, and very few people know what powers it holds. Some of the upper-echelon of the Extreme King might know, but at the very least, King Bai doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of it. If he was, Ice Blue Knight King wouldn\u2019t have risked disobeying his orders. Sending me back to the Extreme King means giving the stone plate to King Bai.\u201d Han Sen was deep in thought when he suddenly heard a sound coming from deeper within the stone cave. It sounded as if something was crawling around.\n\nHan Sen peered into the cave with his Dongxuan Aura activated. He detected a lifeforce was getting closer to his position.\n\nThe lifeforce didn\u2019t seem to be very strong, though, and that helped settle Han Sen\u2019s nerves.\n\nThe noise was getting closer, and a few minutes later, Han Sen saw a weird xenogeneic appear in the cave.\n\nA body covered in sleek black fur appeared. It looked startlingly smooth, and its fur glistened. It was about the size of a cat, and its eyes were huge, like shiny pieces of black jewelry. It looked like a big-eyed thief.\n\nHan Sen looked at the xenogeneic, and the xenogeneic looked back at him. They both stared at each other for a while.\n\nThen, the xenogeneic just ignored him. It turned to saunter down another stone path. Its butt wiggled as it walked, waving its tail in a slow rhythm.\n\nHan Sen raised an eyebrow, as the creature\u2019s tail seemed to be holding an item that looked like a bracelet.\n\nIt was odd to see the piece of platinum attached to the creature\u2019s tail, rather than being held in the creature\u2019s claws. It looked like the item had been deliberately placed there, though.\n\nHan Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to take a closer look, and he noticed there were a few words inscribed across the item.\n\n\u201cSacred General Ghost Bone.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes widened, and he made the decision to follow that little critter.\n\n\u201cIs that thing related to General Ghost Bone, by any chance? It doesn\u2019t seem nearly strong enough. At the very most, that thing is no greater than a Viscount. If General Ghost Bone wanted a pet, I doubt he would select something that was so weak.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t in a rush to take down the little beast, and so he just trailed after it.\n\nThe little beast showed no sign that it was afraid of him. Without pausing, it meandered its way down a series of caves. It wasn\u2019t in a hurry, and its pace was quite lackadaisical.\n\nHan Sen followed it patiently down the tunnels. And the whole time, he had many thoughts going through his mind. \u201cThat ancient city was called Ghost Bone Town, but the Ghost Bone statue there was just like a guard for the gate. Inside the hall of the palace, there was a statue of that Human King. The top of the Human King Statue is what pedestaled the stone plate. What does that mean, I wonder?\u201d\n\nAfter the beast had been traveling for about an hour, it reached a hidden river. It crouched down on its stomach so it could drink some water.\n\n\u201cThis guy has walked so far. Surely he didn\u2019t come all this way for a drink of water,\u201d Han Sen thought in agitation.\n\nEventually, the beast seemed to have drunk its fill. Without any warning, it leaped into the dark river. It lay on its back in the water like an otter, floating down with the stream.\n\nHan Sen put Little Star away and followed after it.\n\nBut soon, the underground river sank into the ground. The creature sank into it, as well. Han Sen gritted his teeth and jumped into the water. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly as he followed after the creature.\n\nThe underground water was fast-flowing, and it was fortunate that Han Sen didn\u2019t encounter any water element xenogeneics. Han Sen followed it for a few hundred miles, but there seemed to be no end in sight.\n\nAfter an interminable time in the water, the floating beast suddenly swam towards a wall.\n\nHan Sen looked towards it, and there, he saw a small tunnel leading through the stone wall. The hole was around the size of a melon, and the creature wriggled its way in without much trouble.\n\nHan Sen was too big, so he couldn\u2019t follow it in. He summoned Little Star to carry him inside.\n\nHan Sen soon discovered that the hole hadn\u2019t formed naturally. It was actually a metal pipe.\n\n\u201cWhy is there a man-made metal pipe here?\u201d Han Sen was surprised.\n\nThe little beast drifted down the metal pipe, and Han Sen pursued it atop Little Star. They traveled a couple of miles before the tunnel brightened and Little Star emerged from the wall.\n\nAs he looked around, Han Sen found himself gaping in surprise. That place was an underground palace. The metal pipe he had followed brought him out via the mouth of a giant fish statue. Water flowed continuously out of the tube, creating a small waterfall down into a pool.\n\nThe pool was made of jade-like stone. The water was very clear, and Han Sen could see all the way to the bottom.\n\nBut when Han Sen looked closer, he froze. Inside the pool, there was a black-and-white eye staring back at him.\n\nHan Sen gazed into that stony stare, and his breath caught in his chest."
