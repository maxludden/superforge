    "text": "The Hell Ghosts on both sides stared coldly at Han Sen and the blood kirin. They were like a crowd gathered to watch a funeral procession. It didn\u2019t seem as if they wished to do anything to stop the intruders, though.\n\nAs Han Sen continued to walk, he thought about his situation. \u201cThose who are outside of this bridge can see what is actually going on, so the Hell Ghosts really are just statues. They only appear to be alive because I am on the bridge. It could be just a feeling or the adverse effect of some type of power that gives them the appearance of life. The Hell Ghosts aren\u2019t attacking us, but they might be configured to release power of some sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this line of thinking is correct, then how did Yisha end up in the clutches of that menacing statue? Does that mean there is one Hell Ghost statue that is actually a living being?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nHe and the blood kirin continued to walk across the bridge. The purple stain in their skin deepened as they went, but the way ahead of them was still clear. The purple jade bridge reached on without an end in sight.\n\nThat purple air didn\u2019t seem to be affecting their bodies, but it made Han Sen rather worried all the same.\n\n\u201cThese purple airs might be part of a process to build up power. The more that is gathered, the stronger the inevitable explosion would be,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBecause the jade bridge\u2019s length had been extended by the distorted dimension, Han Sen rode the blood kirin as it sprinted at top speed for over a hundred hours. Only then did they finally see the middle of the bridge coming up.\n\nJust as it had appeared on the outside, Yisha had been grabbed by a giant, evil Hell Ghost. The sight was quite different now that Han Sen was standing on the bridge, though. The giant Hell Ghost wasn\u2019t a statue in this place. It was an actual creature.\n\nIt had purple skin and wings, and its head had a pair of purple horns that looked like bull horns. Its body was like a wild monkey. It gripped Yisha tightly, and its eyes were shining with purple light.\n\n\u201cQueen!\u201d Han Sen shouted at Yisha as he rode closer to her on the blood kirin.\n\nWhen Han Sen had called to her from outside the bridge, Yisha had been unable to hear him. Now that they were in the same dimension, Han Sen thought he might be able to get her attention.\n\nYisha slowly started to open her eyes. She rolled her head over to look at Han Sen, but it was clearly a struggle in her weakened state.\n\nAs she saw Han Sen coming across the bridge, Yisha\u2019s expression became strange. She stared at him for a while, as if she was trying to determine whether Han Sen was real or just a delirious fantasy.\n\n\u201cMy Queen, are you okay?\u201d Han Sen shouted as he came toward her.\n\nThe statue that held Yisha didn\u2019t behave as if it had heard Han Sen. It just continued to hold Yisha as if it hadn\u2019t noticed Han Sen and the blood kirin.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Yisha whispered. Han Sen could tell that she could barely summon the strength to speak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story; we can talk about it later. But tell me: how can I help you?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nYisha shook her head. \u201cYou should find a way to save yourself. Your body has collected a lot of that hellish air. If you don\u2019t leave, the Hell Ghost will soon see you. And when that happens, it will be too late for you to run. Get off of this hell bridge, and you might find a way to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou selected the hell bridge for a specific reason, yes?\u201d Han Sen asked. It didn\u2019t look as if he intended to leave anytime soon.\n\n\u201cDo not waste time talking to me about this. Get lost!\u201d Yisha scolded him with a frown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one here. There is a deified elite waiting for me, and she is my enemy. Even if I do make it out of here, I\u2019m just going to end up dead,\u201d Han Sen said with a shrug.\n\nYisha looked surprised. She quietly said, \u201cYou are a magnet for trouble. Whatever, then. Since you are here, let\u2019s try something out. Maybe we can both live through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lady! You have a way to get out of here?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nYisha smiled and said, \u201cI selected the hell bridge so I could use the hell power to activate my Rebate elder blood. That way, I could become deified. But I failed. Since you are here, perhaps you can help me try again. The success rate is low, but it is certainly worth a try.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I help?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked.\n\nYisha took a deep breath and slowly said, \u201cI told you before: our Rebate elder used to be a servant for an important person amongst the Extreme King. That man was called Hell King. He had a Hell God Body, and it possessed an intense hell power.\u201d\n\nYisha began coughing and had to take a deep breath before continuing her speech. \u201cBecause he treated our elder very nicely, Hell King put some of his Hell King blood into her body. So, that way, our elder could one day become deified and create Teeth power. It was all because of Hell King\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the Hell King blood I possess is too weak. The Rebate elder was given a powerful gift, but she didn\u2019t possess the blood naturally. When it was passed from child to child, it became weaker with every generation. After so many years have passed, the Hell King blood is so light that it might not even exist anymore. I wanted to use the hell power to activate the Hell King blood, but it proved to be too difficult. Either that, or the blood has vanished completely.\u201d\n\nYisha looked at Han Sen. \u201cBut now, even though this is a one in a billion chance, we have to take it. However, I have no power, and so I will have to make use of your power. If it doesn\u2019t work, you and I will die here together. If you don\u2019t want to take this risk, you should leave now while there is still time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Han Sen repeated.\n\nIf Han Sen didn\u2019t save Yisha, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he made it to the other side of the hell bridge alive. Fox Queen would be waiting.\n\nIf he was able to help Yisha become deified, things might turn out differently. Yisha was his teacher. If he saved her, Yisha would probably help him get the Sacred Leader\u2019s legacy treasure.\n\nAnd with a deified elite next to him, he would no longer have to fear Fox Queen.\n\nYisha sighed. She looked at the Hell Ghost that had grabbed her and told Han Sen, \u201cThis ghost statue is the key to this entire hell bridge. All the power of the hell bridge stems from this. If I can get its blood, perhaps then I can become deified\u2026\u201d\n\nYisha took a deep breath and went on to say, \u201cIt is not living, by the way. It is just a statue with hell blood. It is currently attracted by my power, and so most of its power is focused solely on me. You can use this opportunity to break its body and collect the hell blood. Help me become deified. The success rate is so low, though\u2026\u201d"
