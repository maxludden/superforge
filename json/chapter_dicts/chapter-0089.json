    "text": "\"Now, do you have something to say to me?\" Yang Manli approached Han Sen who was standing like a statute.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t reached a certain level in Jadeskin, so his fatigue wasn\u2019t cleared away completely. Having stood there for over three hours, he was drenched in sweat.\n\nEven so, his stance was still firm as ever and his hands holding the bow didn\u2019t even tremble.\n\nYang Manli for the first time felt that maybe Han Sen was somewhat talented. He had been standing like that for more than three hours and his hands were still steady, which was a great quality for an archer.\n\n\"Captain, I really have nothing to say,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"Well, since you are so tough, you could keep standing here.\" Yang Manli went away without looking back. She was a little angry, but also respected Han Sen for what he did. That was a difficult task for a sixteen-year-old. She herself could only last two hours with a 6.0 bow at his age.\n\nAfter Yang Manli had closely observed Han Sen\u2019s situation and made sure he was fine, she was surprised to see that he did have the energy to continue.\n\nAlthough this was a test of endurance, and didn\u2019t have much to do with his other qualities. It still showed that Han Sen was outstanding in something, as someone with a fitness index less than 10 wasn\u2019t likely to last this long.\n\n\"How can he have such strong endurance?\" Yang Manli thought she probably couldn\u2019t even accomplish this herself, while Han Sen, someone with much worse fitness than she, could pull through.\n\nAfter Yang Manli went back to the office, she continued to monitor Han Sen. On one hand, she wanted to find out how long Han Sen could last in the end; on the other hand, she was afraid his arms would be damaged.\n\nShe did not want Han Sen on her team, but she did not mean to harm him either. That was why she couldn\u2019t let anything happen to him. Not to mention she had started to appreciate his endurance and perseverance.\n\nAs for Han Sen's answer, in fact, Yang Manli did not really want to hear it. If Han Sen had really confessed, Yang Manli would have thought he was a snitch.\n\nBefore long, the soldiers took some water and food and sneaked back into the gym.\n\n\"Brother, great job. Come and drink some nutrition solution to get some strength.\" A soldier opened a bottle of nutrient solution and lifted it to Han Sen\u2019s lips.\n\n\"Eat something. Although this meat is as good as the meat from God\u2019s Sanctuary, it was cooked by a chef here and the taste is good.\" Another soldier held a large piece of barbecue on a fork and put it up to Han Sen\u2019s mouth.\n\n\"It\u2019s fine. I only have one hour left and must satisfy Yang\u2019s demand. I am afraid she would say it doesn\u2019t count if you help me,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"Brother, you are really a tough guy. I don\u2019t admire anyone but you.\"\n\n\"Right, what is your name?\"\n\n\"Han Sen.\"\n\n\"You are just over 16 right?\"\n\n\"Haven\u2019t had my 17th birthday.\"\n\n\"Are all kids so tough these days?\"\n\n\"I do not know about others, but I'm definitely the toughest.\"\n\n\"Do not talk to him anymore. It consumes his energy.\"\n\nThe soldiers saw Han Sen was fine and set up a table next to him to play cards. Han Sen was upset and thought, \"You animals. Are you trying to help or piss me off?\"\n\nHan Sen had been standing there for more than four hours. The soldiers watched the clock turning to one second past midnight, put the cards down, took the bow over and raised Han Sen up, ready to throw him into the hydro massage machine.\n\n\"Don\u2019t! I do not need the massage. It\u2019s too late now. I have to go home.\" Han Sen quickly waved his hands. He had seen this kind of machine before, and it would take at least an hour before he could get out. He did not want to waste his time here.\n\n\"That is not okay. You have been stretching your muscles for too long, which could severely harm your body. You must fully relax through the massage so that your veins and muscles could be revitalized. You have to stay in it for at least three hours with the strongest mode on,\" said a soldier seriously.\n\n\"I'm alright.\" Han Sen couldn\u2019t really wait three hours. As the soldiers insisted, he used a technique from Ghosthaunt and grabbed a soldier\u2019s neck. With a twist, he wiggled free like a snake.\n\n\"Brothers, I\u2019m really okay. I have to go home now. If you don\u2019t believe me, I will show you that I still have the energy to perform military boxing,\" Han Sen said and performed the complete set of military boxing.\n\nMilitary boxing was something taught at the integrated compulsory education, and was something as simple as gymnastics. But all the soldiers were dumbfounded by it. They watched Han Sen as if they had seen a ghost.\n\n\"S*#t! Kid you must be a monster under the human skin,\" the soldiers suddenly shouted when Han Sen finished the military boxing.\n\n\"A Shura under the human skin!\"\n\n\"A perpetual motion machine under the human skin!\"\n\nWhen Han Sen left the teleport station, it was one o\u2019clock in the morning. His mother and sister weren\u2019t home so he cooked himself something to fill his stomach and went to bed.\n\nAlthough Han Sen's body was fine, he did feel rather tired and almost fell asleep immediately.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get up until it was noon.\n\nHan Sen stretched and felt very good all over. It was as if all his cells and pores were revitalized. He discovered that he had made great progress in Jadeskin. Although it was still just a little, it was about the effect of ten days\u2019 practice.\n\n\"So Jadeskin is practiced more efficiently under extreme conditions?\" Han Sen was surprised.\n\nIt was worth a shot anyway. If it was true, it would be great for his practice of Jadeskin.\n\nHan Sen was not in a hurry. He had lots of time to train in the gravity trainer in the future. If he didn\u2019t do it, Yang Manli would make him anyway.\n\nHan Sen had carefully thought about his current situation. It would still be a while until he could become an aristocrat and it was not a bad thing to join Qin Xuan\u2019s squad to gain protection for his family.\n\nAs Qin Xuan had said, if Son of Heaven wanted to harm his family. There wasn\u2019t really much he could do even if he was home. The military\u2019s protection was more reliable.\n\nSon of Heaven was careful with Qin Xuan in God\u2019s Sanctuary, so Han Sen believed that Qin Xuan\u2019s background would deter Son of Heaven. As long as Son of Heaven didn\u2019t know he was Dollar, Han Sen didn\u2019t think the guy would risk offending the military force for some small conflict."
