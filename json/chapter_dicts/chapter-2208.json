    "text": "Han Sen was indulging himself with quality drinks and food hot off the grill, but he suddenly looked up and let his face go blank. Something powerful was coming his way, and it extinguished the fire in a single moment. Not even smoke was left to rise from the ashes.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, how dare you cheat on my tests!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King barked. He stood with his arms crossed over his chest, a man clad in green clothing beside him.\n\nHan Sen instantly became worried, but his expression remained unchanged. \u201cKnight King, why would you say something like that? How could I have cheated?\u201d\n\nWhen Ice Blue Knight King saw Han Sen remain so calm despite the powerful presences approaching him, he knew for sure that he had drastically misjudged Han Sen. The man really had played him. Ordinary Dukes would be groveling on the floor in front of such a dangerous aura. Only someone extraordinary could have kept his cool in this situation.\n\n\u201cIf I say you were cheating, you were cheating! Even if you didn\u2019t intend to deceive the tests, I still consider you a cheater.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King approached Han Sen with a scary amount of power.\n\nIce Blue Knight King had led knights throughout the systems of chaos for over a century, and he had killed countless creatures in that time. He was a very scary man. And in addition to all that, he had the will of a half-deified being. Even a King would be intimidated in his presence.\n\nHan Sen sighed and said, \u201cWell, what are you going to do to me?\u201d\n\nAlthough that sounded very hopeless, Ice Blue Knight King knew that Han Sen wasn\u2019t actually cowed. The Knight King was actually quite curious about this resilience, though.\n\n\u201cKill you.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King pulled out his sword so fast, the others at the barbeque didn\u2019t even see when it cleared the sheath. Before they could blink, a blue light was coming down on Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\nThe ice blue greatsword stopped one inch above Han Sen\u2019s hair. Han Sen didn\u2019t flinch or show the slightest change in his expression, though. All he did was looked at Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White and say, \u201cIf you do not mind joining me, I can have wine and meat brought for you. Would you please accept some as an apology?\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King was quite surprised, but he kept his gaze flat as he stared at Han Sen. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I would kill you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Han Sen responded.\n\nThere was something else Han Sen could\u2019ve said, but didn\u2019t. Even if Ice Blue Knight King wished to kill him, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to. His sword would have greeted the Demon Bug Bai Sema, not Han Sen\u2019s flesh.\n\nIce Blue Knight King glanced at Mister White and sheathed his greatsword. He then moved to sit beside the fire. Looking interested, he asked Han Sen, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you choose to join us Ice Blue Knights? Give me a decent reason, and I might just let you go.\u201d\n\nHan Sen sat down and began to explain the situation without hiding any details. He told the Knight King about the grudge he held with Night River King, then finished with, \u201cIf I go, Night River King will do harm to my friends and family here.\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King laughed and said, \u201cThat is trivial. I will make a recruitment order to forcefully conscript Night River King into the Ice Blue Knights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to leave me? Why go to all this trouble?\u201d Han Sen murmured, depressed. Recruiting a King to join the Ice Blue Knights was a big decision, and so Han Sen didn\u2019t understand why the man was going through all that trouble to secure one Marquise.\n\nIce Blue Knight King took Han Sen\u2019s bottle of beer and had a swig. He said coldly, \u201cThe Ice Blue Knights are in charge of cleaning up a planet in the systems of chaos, but this planet has many deified xenogeneics. They appeared unexpectedly, and we were short-handed on troops. If Knife hadn\u2019t sacrificed herself to buy us more time, the Ice Blue Knights would all be gone. We owe her a great deal, and so, our debt falls to depend on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you really want to pay her sacrifice back, then let me stay here.\u201d Han Sen really didn\u2019t want to be a part of the Ice Blue Knights. He hated the concept of being confined. The Ice Blue Knights were like a proper army with way too many rules.\n\nIce Blue Knight King didn\u2019t answer. He cheered and tapped his drink with Mister White. Then, he looked at his empty cup and told Han Sen, \u201cThis drink is nice. You can bring more with you when we leave.\u201d\n\nSeeing Han Sen looking rather glum, Ice Blue Knight King grinned. Mister White smiled and said, \u201cDo not worry. If Ice Blue Knight King wishes to take you, he will prepare everything. Night River King will go, too, and we will certainly be keeping an eye on Narrow Moon.\u201d\n\nHan Sen seriously said, \u201cIf things are like that, then I won\u2019t complain too much. But I do have one important condition. If you agree to this, then I will have no problem with coming along. If you don\u2019t agree, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be taking me there in a body bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat condition is that?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King asked curiously.\n\n\u201cI want them to come with me as part of the team. You cannot split us up, no matter what.\u201d Han Sen pointed at Han Meng\u2019er and the others.\n\nIce Blue Knight King shook his head. \u201cThe Ice Blue Knights have rules. If they cannot pass the test, they cannot join. And if they cannot pass the test, then your conditions cannot be met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t completed the test, so I\u2019m not qualified to join. Please let me go,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIce Blue Knight King looked at Han Sen. \u201cDo you know what a chance you\u2019re trying to give up? I\u2019m aware of your difficulty. Your body and geno arts require many resources to level up. Knife is gone, and Narrow Moon won\u2019t be giving you anything but scraps. The only chance you have is to come with me to the systems of chaos.\u201d\n\nHan Sen just stared at Ice Blue Knight King without speaking. He stood by the decision he had made.\n\nIce Blue Knight King didn\u2019t want to concede. He had his rules, and Han Sen\u2019s request had been too much.\n\nThe scene froze with two men unwilling to take a step back. Mister White smiled. \u201cThe Ice Blue Knights do have rules. Han Sen\u2019s demands are too much to ask.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen could speak, Mister White continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to join the Ice Blue Knights directly, but I could use a few more guards. And my guards don\u2019t belong to the Ice Blue Knights. There aren\u2019t too many rules with me, so if you would like to, you can come along as part of my team.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister White, how could you do that? Your guards are required to be King class!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King exclaimed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re my guards, and I\u2019m free to choose who I want, am I not?\u201d Mister White smiled.\n\nHan Sen looked at Ice Blue Knight King, and then he looked at Mister White. He was confused."
