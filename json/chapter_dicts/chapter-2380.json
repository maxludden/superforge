    "text": "The impact of Han Sen\u2019s display continued to swell.\n\nPrince Sixteen\u2019s introduction didn\u2019t possess any Shocking Sky power or flashy techniques, but his words were like a rock falling into a lake. The splash and ripples were felt across every corner of King\u2019s Kingdom. Everyone knew Prince Sixteen Bai Yi had been the catalyst for two massive events in their history, and so his reputation had become substantial.\n\nMost people still believed that his words were an amusing mistake, or maybe even a straight-up joke. No one actually thought Bai Yi could do what he claimed.\n\nMost people\u2019s expectations for the results of the exam hadn\u2019t changed, though. The first and second spots were presumably going to be secured by the two deified royal children. It was almost a default assumption. Prince Sixteen, who only had a one-tier area, wouldn\u2019t be able to create many waves. No matter how well he performed, he was just there to add more fun action for the spectators to watch. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nBut they were wrong. They had been wrong since the very beginning. Han Sen was prepared to fight. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t take first place, but he at least hoped to reach the top three.\n\nPlus, Han Sen had more than a first-tier area. His Original Water King Body was a mutant xenogeneic gene that he had refined. Ordinarily, it couldn\u2019t have grown beyond the power it possessed when Han Sen first claimed it. It was first-tier when he got it, and first-tier it would remain.\n\nIn the intervening time, however, Han Sen had gotten the Ancient God Origin. With that miraculous water power, the Original Water King Body was able to level up to a second-tier area.\n\n\u201cThe Ancient God Origin is quite special. No wonder why so many elites wanted it. If my Original Water King Body can keep leveling up, that would be excellent,\u201d Han Sen mused as he played with the Ancient God Origin. A smile spread across his lips at the thought.\n\nBut Han Sen wondered about his relationship with Ancient Water God. Han Sen had thought that he had gravely insulted Ancient Water God, but when the powerful being died, he sought Han Sen out and gave him the Ancient God Origin. It was very confusing.\n\nThe higher tier a King reached, the stronger they would become. Once he reached the ninth tier, his King area would reset to tier one again, and he would become half-deified. Although the jump in power wasn\u2019t as impressive as becoming deified, half-deified elites had several multiples of the power of a ninth-tier King. That was why they were considered half-deified.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t expect his Original Water King Body to reach the deified level. He would be satisfied if he was able to use the support of the Ancient God Origin to become half-deified.\n\nBut despite employing many different methods, Han Sen hadn\u2019t been able to move his Ancient God Origin. He couldn\u2019t eat it, and neither could he drain power from it. At most, he could begin to meld the Original Water King Body into the Ancient God Origin.\n\nHe fed the powers of the Original Water King Body into the Ancient God Origin, and they began to exist as one. The Ancient God Origin\u2019s power wasn\u2019t something that Han Sen could access freely, but the secondary effect it was having on his Original Water King Body was undeniable.\n\nThe exams were about to start. The first day was used to transport all of the royal children to Rot Bone Mountain. The children gathered at the bottom of the mountain, and they stared up at the loft peak above them, thrusting into the sky like a spear. They felt so small in comparison.\n\nRot Bone Mountain was like a pillar pointing to the heavens. Only its foothills were visible, as the peak was high above the clouds. A single rocky staircase would lead them all the way up to that semi-transparent peak.\n\nWhile they waited for the command that would tell them to start their hike, Bai Ling Shuang slowly moved closer to Han Sen. She looked at him, but she didn\u2019t say anything to him.\n\nNinety percent of Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s trail was made of stone. All of King\u2019s Kingdom\u2019s civilians and nobles could see this. Only the path above the clouds, the one that led to the peak, couldn\u2019t be seen. Even deified elites couldn\u2019t look through the clouds and see what resided there.\n\nBai Ling Shuang couldn\u2019t let everyone know that Han Sen was helping her out. If she allowed that, all of the Extreme King would start laughing at her. So, she would walk ninety percent of the path alone. Near the end, when she reached the trickier path, she was willing to ask Han Sen for help.\n\nThe last path was the most difficult path on Rot Bone Mountain. Bai Ling Shuang wasn\u2019t confident that she could reach the end of that path.\n\nAfter a loud noise, one hundred royal children approached the stone staircase. They looked like horses as they stampeded up. Either that, or some experienced hiking team. The children stretched into a long line that inched its way up the mountain.\n\nLeading the group was the crown prince Bai Weijie. No one fought for the path ahead of him. He was the crown prince, and he was in the front.\n\nBehind the crown prince were the deified Prince Four and Princess Two. They walked together, side by side.\n\nThen, there were some half-deified royal children following directly behind, including Bai Ling Shuang and Bai Canglang. After them came the King class royal children like Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen looked around. He didn\u2019t see Bai Wuchang. It looked like the man wasn\u2019t taking part in the exam.\n\nBai Qing Xia walked next to Han Sen and quietly said, \u201cBrother Sixteen, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen nodded, and he walked up the stone stairs alongside Bai Qing Xia.\n\nIn the back of the group, a pair of pretty eyes were locked on the back of Han Sen\u2019s head. Those eyes belonged to Bai Wei.\n\nHan Sen thought Rot Bone Mountain would be difficult to ascend. Otherwise, Bai Ling Shuang wouldn\u2019t have been willing to give up so many King class xenogeneic genes for his help.\n\nBut after Han Sen walked for a while, he noticed that Rot Bone Mountain didn\u2019t seem as hard as he had expected. Aside from the air restriction that kept them from using flying powers, everything seemed normal.\n\nBut when Han Sen tried to speed up, things changed immediately.\n\nHe had been walking easily up the path, but now a force pushed heavily against him, crippling his speed. It was like he was trying to run through water; the faster he went, the more resistance he felt. The force resisting him seemed inexhaustible, and Han Sen had no option but to slow down.\n\nWhen he slowed down, the resistance lessened. He was almost unable to feel it any longer.\n\n\u201cNow I understand why everyone is walking so slowly. I didn\u2019t realize this Rot Bone Mountain was so amazing,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cBrother Sixteen, our fight in King\u2019s Kingdom isn\u2019t done yet. When we fight on the Extreme King\u2019s stage, let us finally find out which one of us will win,\u201d Bai Qing Xia said as he walked beside Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you lose the last time?\u201d Han Sen asked, blinking.\n\nBai Qing Xia smiled. \u201cI lost with the Kingese, but the fight didn\u2019t see a victor crowned. Hatred Times Ten, I have more than just a few tiers now.\u201d\n\nHan Sen gave the man a surprised glance. \u201cHow many tiers do you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine tiers. I only need one more to reach Times Ten, but my body is only King class with two tiers. I cannot break through the last tier.\u201d Bai Qing Xia wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything, so he answered Han Sen\u2019s question plainly.\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Han Sen complimented him.\n\nAnd Han Sen meant what he said. Han Sen had researched Hatred Times Ten after their battle, and it was indeed an amazing skill. Very few people could learn it. Times One required a first-tier King area, so to practice Times Nine, you would need a ninth-tier area.\n\nDespite being only a second-tier King, Bai Qing Xia had reached Times Nine. He was talented."
