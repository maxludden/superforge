    "text": "Taking out the Wanjie Rubix Cube, he used it in accordance with the instructions given to him by Fang Qing Yu. He made contact with Fang Qing Yu\u2019s step-father and streamed the video over to him.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cTreasure Identifier Elder, Mister Qing Yu\u2019s signal is off. What do we do? The video we have is about to run out, and every station is waiting for more. If there is no more content, we won\u2019t earn a penny. Our money will be gone, and we will have to pay fines for breaking the contract.\u201d Cold sweat was gathering on Kevin\u2019s forehead. Looking like an ant being held over boiling water, he looked over to the Treasure Identifier Elder.\n\nThis plan was secret. They couldn\u2019t reveal the content. They signed a contract with different media platforms of the various high races, purchasing air time for their video footage.\n\nThose media sources had rigid requirements for the content they put out, however. If the Thousand Treasures group couldn\u2019t put out the content in time, they were going to lose money.\n\nThe Treasure Identifier Elder\u2019s phone was ringing constantly. There was no need for him to look at it, because he already knew that it was his business partners that were calling.\n\nThe plan had failed. He would lose his savings, which was an acceptable loss, but there were many other people that were going to go bankrupt with him. And that wasn\u2019t even what he was worried about the most.\n\n\u201cQing Yu must know how important it is to keep the video running, but the communication has come to an end. Is he\u2026\u201d The Treasure Identifier Elder\u2019s face was shifting through a variety of emotions.\n\nSuddenly, the Wanjie Rubix Cube lit up. A new video was being streamed from Fang Qing Yu\u2019s Rubix cube.\n\n\u201cThere he is, and there\u2019s the fight! Quick! Record all of this footage and get it processed immediately\u2026\u201d Kevin was so excited that he was screaming the instructions.\n\n\u201cThis video is\u2026 How is he filming from that perspective?\u201d The Treasure Identifier Elder stared at the video with wide eyes.\n\nThe video showed the fight with the demon spirit, but it seemed to be filmed from a first-person perspective. It was like the person filming was the same person who was fighting the demon spirit. Every detail was crystal clear.\n\nNormal people couldn\u2019t have made any sense of the raw footage; to them, it would only have looked like blurring shapes and blinding flashes of light.\n\nThe video stream of the Wanjie Rubix Cube was recorded by special equipment, and the Thousand Treasures team edited it carefully before releasing it through their media sources. They slowed it down by an order of magnitude; otherwise, most people wouldn\u2019t have had any idea what was going on. Only someone like the Treasure Identifier Elder himself could watch the raw footage and understand what was actually happening.\n\n\u201cThat Han Sen has bad luck! He hid inside the Tianxia System and kidnapped a few people to pull his boat. Then, he met a guy with a Wanjie Rubix Cube. Now, the Extreme King know where he is, and he won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, they ran into a group of cloud beasts\u2026 Why did the video shut off?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s back now! What the hell? The Extreme King are fighting the cloud beasts\u2026 Holy sh*t! That\u2019s the Sea Demon Car! The Sea Demon Car is opening\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, d*mn\u2026 Why is it gone?\u201d\n\nAll the media channels were playing the videos the Treasure Identifier Elder was producing, all at the same time. The display drew the attention of many viewers.\n\nBecause equipment inside the Tianxia System was usually affected by the magnetic storms, most films that came from the system were basically unwatchable. Capturing the Sea Demon Car on film would be even more difficult. Every race was drawn by this new showcase, and viewership figures skyrocketed.\n\nMany different races populated the geno universe, and most races had at least a billion members. Some of the bigger races had tens of billions. The viewership figures ascended to a frightening sum in a very short amount of time.\n\nBut the moment that the Sea Demon Car opened, the video went dark. All of the viewers watching became furious at the tease, and it made them want to smash their viewing devices.\n\nBecause the video had been cut-off before, though, they hoped it would come back and they could continue to watch.\n\nBut then, some words appeared on the blank screen. \u201cThis content is now only accessible on a paid channel. Please enter the paid channel to view the secrets of the Sea Demon Car and the fate of the Extreme King. This is being streamed live from a massive battle in the Tianxia System. And this program is brought to you by the Hammer\u2026 Use the xenogeneic treasures of the Hammer to live a good life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMotherf*cking Hammer!\u201d\n\n\u201cThose money-hungry b*stards\u2026\u201d\n\nEveryone across the geno universe was upset about being baited into purchasing a paid channel, but still, many nobles accepted it. They paid to watch the video and immediately switched to the new channel. They didn\u2019t want to miss a single second of the action.\n\nThis was the first time the Sea Demon Car had been shown in such clarity and detail. Many people would have spent vast amounts of money for any scrap of information they could find on the elusive xenogeneic, but now they only had to spend a small amount for an entire video focused on the creature.\n\nIt was worth it. It was way too worth it. Real elites couldn\u2019t care less about the cost of a single inexpensive video.\n\nEven ordinary people could afford to watch. The paid channel cost about as much as a pack of cigarettes.\n\nWhen they entered the paid mode, they saw the demon spirit exit the Sea Demon Car. Then the creature blew up the black beetle ship and engaged Bao Qin directly.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! The demon spirit is strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverwhelming. It is scary!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what the creature inside the Sea Demon Car looks like. It isn\u2019t very physically large, but it\u2019s still quite scary to watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s going on? This perspective makes it look like someone is filming and fighting the demon spirit at the same time. Is Bao Qin filming this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be Bao Qin. Who else could film from such a perspective?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre the Extreme King in some sort of economic crisis? He is a deified elite of the Extreme King, and he needs to earn money by streaming? And he added some motherf*cking sponsor and advert. How desperately do they want to earn money?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that! It isn\u2019t easy to become a deified elite. While they are strong, they still require resources.\u201d\n\nConversations about the video raged everywhere, and most people seemed to be complaining about Bao Qin\u2019s behavior. The Extreme King themselves were quite shocked, and they weren\u2019t sure about what was going on, either. They didn\u2019t know why Bao Qin would stream this video of a battle and allow the media of all the different races to broadcast it.\n\nA first-person perspective fight was incredibly exciting for viewers. Their blood boiled as they watched. This was a deified fight, which wasn\u2019t something that usually allowed spectators.\n\nIf they had been anywhere near this fight in real life, they would have run away. They wouldn\u2019t have the guts to stay and watch two godly beings fight. And even if they were ballsy enough to stay and watch, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to see much anyway.\n\nThese videos had been edited by professionals, allowing ordinary people to understand what was going on. It also let them see just how powerful deified beings could be.\n\nHan Sen was watching the fight through Bao Qin\u2019s eyes. And to him, it looked even crazier.\n\nThe demon spirit was like dust on the wind. Its body was very light, and even Bao Qin\u2019s eyes and speed could barely keep track of the xenogeneic.\n\nBao Qin struck repeatedly, but he only hit the places where the demon spirit had just been.\n\nIf not for the harp in Bao Qin\u2019s hand, he would have already been killed by the demon spirit\u2019s fist. Luckily for him, his harp was able to weaken the demon spirit\u2019s speed and power."
