The choice is yours.\u201d The princess\u2019 face didn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cFine. Whatever. She is just a useless kid. If you want her, then you can have her.\u201d Han Sen rolled his eyes and returned to the building. He brought out Bao\u2019er and lobbed her toward the princess.\n\nThe princess frowned. She caught Bao\u2019er and immediately turned away from Han Sen. She took Bao\u2019er away from the garden. She moved hurriedly, as if remaining in the garden for one more second would make her feel incredibly filthy.\n\nBao\u2019er lay across the princess\u2019 shoulder, clutching her neck. She winked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cD*mn woman\u2026 Don\u2019t let me find a chance\u2026\u201d Han Sen grumbled, but he winked back at Bao\u2019er.\n\nThe princess wanted Bao\u2019er, and Han Sen needed Bao\u2019er to amass information on his behalf. Bao\u2019er\u2019s intelligence and power made her a great infiltrator.\n\nBai Wei and the princess didn\u2019t give Han Sen any further headaches. He was most worried about the meeting with Bai Ling Shuang, and that was because Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure what sort of deal had been established between Bai Ling Shuang and Bai Yi. He didn\u2019t know what Bai Ling Shuang had offered Bai Yi to make him hunt Han Sen down in Knight\u2019s Paradise.\n\nBut Han Sen needed to go to Night Charm Town. Bai Yi would definitely have chosen to go there if he had returned from his confrontation with Han Sen.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen was able to read all the information that Mister White had given him before the meeting. He knew what sort of social circles Bai Yi traveled in. At the very least, he knew a thing or two about Bai Yi now.\n\nAt the proposed time of the meet, Han Sen rode the blood kirin and left Planet Water Zone, heading for Bai Ling Shuang\u2019s Night Charm Town.\n\nBai Ling Shuang was different from Bai Yi and Bai Wei. She had an abundance of resources. Night Charm Town was like a top club located in King\u2019s Kingdom, but it was only one of Bai Ling Shuang\u2019s many properties.\n\nIt was a town, yes, but it was one that covered an entire planet. Because Night Charm Town was very famous among the Extreme King, finding information about the place wasn\u2019t difficult. Han Sen made sure to do his homework before he left. Hopefully, nothing there would be strange to him.\n\n\u201cGo and tell your master that Prince Sixteen Bai Yi is here,\u201d Han Sen said to the receptionist, slapping the woman\u2019s butt and squeezing it firmly. He spoke aloud with much pride.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, Night Charm Town doesn\u2019t allow xenogeneics.\u201d The receptionist kept a fixed smile on her face, but her eyes revealed the glint of simmering anger.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t accept people\u2019s xenogeneics? Well, the xenogeneic of Bai Yi is an exception to your rule,\u201d Han Sen said, then walked forward with the blood kirin.\n\nThe faces of the guards changed. They stepped forward as if to stop him, but they then returned to their posts.\n\nThere were many noble snobs around there. Compared to Bai Yi, though, those people were pleasant. No one liked Bai Yi, not even the workers.\n\n\u201cPlease wait, My Prince. The princess is coming.\u201d The receptionist took Han Sen to a room on the highest floor, then left.\n\n\u201cThe Extreme King really know how to enjoy themselves.\u201d Han Sen sat on a sofa and looked around. He stroked the blood kirin\u2019s head as he thought.\n\n\u201cBrother Sixteen, you only have one half-deified xenogeneic. You don\u2019t have to show-off twenty-four-seven.\u201d Bai Ling Shuang walked in and looked at the blood kirin as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHalf-deified xenogeneic? This is nothing in your eyes, of course, but to a useless prince such as myself, it is very important. I need to bring it around often.\u201d Han Sen grabbed a glass of wine and drank it. He looked at Bai Ling Shuang. His smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes, and he said, \u201cBy the way, thank you for your kindness. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be receiving this.\u201d\n\nBai Ling Shuang didn\u2019t want to talk to Han Sen more than necessary. She threw something towards him and clapped her hands.\n\nA very attractive woman came in. She stepped up next to Bai Ling Shuang and bowed. Then, she bowed to Han Sen and said, \u201cMy name is Cher. It is nice to meet you, My Prince.\u201d\n\nCher\u2019s body was very attractive, and her eyes could snare a person\u2019s soul. Her voice was like a hook that could draw the attention of all.\n\n\u201cFox!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at Cher. He was given a fright. She had fox ears and a fox tail behind her.\n\n\u201cThe Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion Pass and Cher are now yours for the day. You should be sufficiently satisfied,\u201d Bai Ling Shuang said emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cYou had so much faith in me, Sister Ten.\u201d Han Sen looked at Cher. He pulled her into his arms and reached right into her clothing.\n\nCher was smiling, but inside, he knew that she hated this.\n\nBai Ling Shuang coldly grunted and left the room. Han Sen now had a headache. He should have thought more about what Bai Yi would have asked for. As a request from Bai Yi, this sadly made sense.\n\nThe Extreme King Pavilion Pass surprised Han Sen, though. He hadn\u2019t been in the Extreme King long, but he had heard about the Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion.\n\nOnly the royal children that were rewarded by King Bai were granted a pass. This was an item that allowed one to get into the Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion. One pass could provide one entry.\n\nThe legends said that there were many legendary treasures there, and that only the royal children were ever allowed access to them. If one was not a royal child, it would be pointless to have the pass.\n\nBai Yi had never received a pass before. Han Sen hadn\u2019t expected that the deal with Bai Ling Shuang would earn him an Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion Pass. The unexpected revelation made Han Sen very happy.\n\nIn the Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion, randomly selected treasures could be bought for high prices. This was a surprise to Han Sen.\n\nBut the other part of Bai Yi\u2019s deal, his desire for a woman\u2014and a Fox woman at that\u2014left Han Sen unsure of how to proceed.\n\nWith Bai Yi\u2019s personality, he would have undoubtedly gone crazy all over the Fox woman.\n\nBut Han Sen wasn\u2019t Bai Yi. He liked pretty girls too, but he didn\u2019t want to do anything with a woman he didn\u2019t know.\n\nAnd most importantly, the room had a camera. Han Sen didn\u2019t have a fetish for being watched.\n\nBut right now, he was disguised as Bai Yi. Leaving a woman that Bai Yi had always dreamed of without doing anything would inspire suspicion from Bai Ling Shuang.\n\nHan Sen even thought Bai Ling Shuang was probably sitting behind a monitor of the camera\u2019s feed, watching his every move.\n\nHan Sen held Cher by the waist, trying to think about how he might deal with the situation.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, this is my first time. Please be gentle\u2026\u201d Cher looked down. Her face seemed red, and the skin of her chest was flushed a little pink. She looked very charming. Seeing her would make anyone feel horny."
