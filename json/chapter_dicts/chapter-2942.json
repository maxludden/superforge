    "text": "It did not just look like one. It really did come alive. The statue\u2019s eyes were lively, and the body turned soft. She stood up and looked at everyone in the pavilion. Nine Thousand King watched as the jade statue was revived. His body shook. He did not look powerful anymore. The light of the battle armor quickly disappeared. The eye closed tightly. There was a thud as he kneeled in front of the revived statue. His head touched the floor. He did not dare raise his head as he said, \u201cServant Number 9 is greeting Miss Wan\u2019er. Do you remember Number 9, Miss Wan\u2019er?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThis old man Nine Thousand King knew Sacred Leader\u2019s sister was called Wan\u2019er and he did not tell me.\u201d\n\nThe statue saw Nine Thousand King, who was terrified on the floor, shivering with fear and not daring to raise his head. She raised the cup in her hand and drank all the wine it contained.\n\n\u201cNumber 9, was that you who wanted to break the statue?\u201d After the statue drank the wine, it started to speak. It was not the voice of a female like Wan\u2019er. It was the voice of a man.\n\nWhen Nine Thousand King heard the voice, he raised his head. He was scared. His eyes opened wide. He looked at the statue like he was looking at a ghost. He only took one small glimpse. Nine Thousand King immediately slapped his own face and said, \u201cIt is my fault. I am a bad servant. I should die.\u201d\n\nHan Sen, who was standing nearby and seeing all of this, was frozen. Nine Thousand King was not joking. He was really slapping himself terribly hard. His cheekbones were breaking. In just a few slaps, he was already covered in blood. Nine Thousand King kept on hitting himself. He kept on hitting himself hard. It was hard enough to be considered a form of suicide.\n\nThe jade statue did not watch Nine Thousand King, who was in the middle of slapping himself to death. He looked at Han Sen. It made Han Sen feel a chill, so he secretly gathered up power. When he heard Nine Thousand King speak after the statue came alive, he felt as if it was embodying Sacred Leader.\n\nThe statue looked at Han Sen and smiled as it asked, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\nAlthough his body looked like Wan\u2019er, his power was too outstanding. One sensed that he was a very gentle man. One would not have thought he was a woman.\n\n\u201cCrystallizer Han Sen. What is your name?\u201d Han Sen thought that person was not hostile, but he did not underestimate him either. He remained in a state of caution.\n\n\u201cName. That is a distant memory. I have almost forgotten.\u201d The man laughed. After a seriously long think, he said, \u201cMy name is Qin Xiu. I am the King Kingdom\u2019s king. Xiu means fixing the country and keeping the peace.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen could say anything, Qin Xiu was talking to Han Sen again. \u201cCan you share a few cups with me?\u201d\n\nQin Xiu sat down in the pavilion. He picked up the bottle and poured two cups of wine. He raised one of them.\n\n\u201cIf you do not mind, I am willing to join you.\u201d Han Sen spoke as he walked into the pavilion. He sat down next to him. He raised the cup that Qin Xiu had poured.\n\nWhile they were talking, Nine Thousand King was still slapping his face. He did not dare stop, but he looked confused.\n\nHe was not able to confirm that the man who had been revived through the statue was his master. He also did not know if the man he served had truly come back to life or if this was some sort of shadow copy.\n\nNo matter who he was, Nine Thousand King did not dare slow down. People like Sacred Leader, even if he only had a sliver of life, he could not disrespect him.\n\nThe master had invited Han Sen for a drink. Nine Thousand King could not believe that this situation was happening. Although Han Sen was a strange character, compared to his master, Nine Thousand King thought Han Sen was not even worth one of his hairs.\n\nIn the universe back then, only God knew how many scary elites found themselves in the position of a servant before the glory of Sacred Leader. Very few God Spirits were able to share a drink with Sacred Leader. Now, Sacred Leader was drinking with Han Sen. He also had addressed Han Sen by his name. Nine Thousand King was in total disbelief.\n\n\u201cIn that universe, whoever was worth the leader addressing them by their name was almighty. Does Han Sen really have what it takes?\u201d Nine Thousand King was shocked.\n\nQin Xiu raised his wine cup and said, \u201cCheers, my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy go cheers with me?\u201d Han Sen was confused. He looked at Qin Xiu. It did not matter if this was Sacred Leader reborn or not, but there was a problem with his attitude.\n\n\u201cHas he seen the relationship between me and Wan\u2019er?\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nQin Xiu laughed and did not answer. He drank all the wine in his cup and said, \u201cBack then, I made this holy garden and cut it out from space. I had it stop and remained fixed in a certain place in time. I made the holy garden cycle every hour. Here, you will never get old, and you will never die. This is a place in which you can live forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cQin Xiu really is Sacred Leader,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nQin Xiu looked at the holy garden and sighed, \u201cI wanted to keep Wan\u2019er here so she could live forever. She could watch her favorite views, eat her favorite meat, and drink her favorite wine. She told me she would rather die than live in an endless loop.\u201d\n\nQin Xiu poured out some wine and drank it all. He closed his eyes. It looked as if he was trying his best to enjoy it. He was remembering the person he used to love it.\n\n\u201cSo, I cut the Holy Kirin\u2019s horn off to make a statue of her. If her soul was inside this statue, she could live forever and would still have her memories. She would just be unable to leave this holy garden.\u201d He put down the cup, smiled, and said, \u201cBut Wan\u2019er said told me it was like being put in prison. She defied my wishes for her.\u201d\n\nHan Sen found this interesting, so he asked, \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\nQin Xiu looked like he was smiling, but he was not smiling. He did not answer Han Sen\u2019s question. He poured himself some wine and looked at the cup of wine in Han Sen\u2019s hand.\n\nHan Sen was fascinated by hearing the tale, so he had forgotten to drink the wine. He quickly necked it down.\n\nQin Xiu was holding the wine bottle. He poured out another drink for Han Sen. He raised his cup and said, \u201cI will cheer you again.\u201d\n\nThis time, Han Sen did not ask why. He knew that Qin Xiu must have known Wan\u2019er was being carried by him in some way. Otherwise, Sacred Leader Qin Xiu would likely not say cheers to a guy he did not even know.\n\nNine Thousand King, who was kneeling outside the pavilion, was frozen. To be cheered by Sacred Leader\u2014in that sky, on that ground, in that life, in that world\u2014was something he had only ever seen performed to Han Sen."
