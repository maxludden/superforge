    "text": "Seeing how shocked Han Sen looked, Hai\u2019er took his reaction for a confirmation. She then murmured, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk here. We should find someplace else to chat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you have the wrong guy; I have no clue about what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Han Sen acted through his shock.\n\nHai\u2019er lifted her lips in a little smile and said, \u201cThere is no use in pretending. I am a thief, and nothing escapes my senses. I will tell this to a Buddha King; you know what will happen to you and Speechless if I do, right?\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen could put another word in, Hai\u2019er continued. \u201cOh, but just so you know, I am not being hostile. Actually, I would like to strike a trade with you.\u201d\n\nAfter saying that, Hai\u2019er pulled Han Sen away from Buddha\u2019s Path. They walked out of the city and went to the banks of a nearby river.\n\nHan Sen wished to hear what she wanted to say, so he didn\u2019t resist following her out.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk here.\u201d Hai\u2019er let Han Sen go, then sat down atop a rock. She smiled and said, \u201cGiven your relationship with Speechless Buddha Lady, I can only assume you know the secrets to heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat secrets?\u201d Han Sen asked Hai\u2019er.\n\n\u201cStop pretending! Heaven has opened many times, and many races have been here. Only ten of them can reach the end, each and every time. I believe there is a secret to this somewhere.\u201d Hai\u2019er was peering right at Han Sen when she continued. \u201cWith Speechless\u2019 reputation, she must assuredly know how to reach the other side. I don\u2019t want anything from you. All I want is for you to take me with you and help me reach the end. If you do, I\u2019ll keep the relationship between you two a secret. I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you have misunderstood us. I know Speechless, but we are not in a relationship with each other. In fact, we have only ever met twice,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHai\u2019er looked annoyed by the denial. Her face filled up with frost and she said, \u201cThis is bad. I am going to tell Buddha King about it right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what if he knows?\u201d Han Sen laughed at Hai\u2019er.\n\nHai\u2019er looked back at Han Sen with disdain. \u201cStill pretending? You can\u2019t hide anything from a Pirate. ^ every trick in the book to get others to join their creed. Marriage is one such method. Many creatures in this universe have been tethered to the Buddha in this way. Like Happy Buddha King; he was the best in the entire universe. Yet even he was suckered into one of those arrangements. Speechless is famous, and she will have a marriage with someone powerful. It\u2019s a must for her. If Buddha King leams about you two, do you think he will let you go lightly? You should know about this.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know the Buddha had such a culture, and he found it rather interesting.\n\nWhen Han Sen didn\u2019t respond, Hai\u2019er went on to say, \u201cOthers don\u2019t know the Buddha are this way, but we do. They are not much smarter than the Pirate, you know. I don\u2019t really like them, and more than that, I don\u2019t want to expose your story. If you help me, it is a win-win situation for all of us.\u201d\n\nYou know who I am?\u201d Han Sen asked Hai\u2019er.\n\nHai\u2019er was surprised and said, \u201cHow am I supposed to know who you are? You\u2019re just a lowly Viscount Even if you are famous, the Buddha won\u2019t let you be with her.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cI am the student of the Rebate called Knife Queen. This is my first time here, and it marks my third encounter with Speechless. Nothing else is going on, okay? You are wholeheartedly mistaken.\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er frowned at Han Sen. She looked right at him. Seeing him turn to leave, she tugged at him and said, \u201cEven if the two of you aren\u2019t together, how about we co-operate anyway? Let\u2019s walk through heaven together!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat benefit is there for us to co-operate?\u201d Han Sen asked Hai\u2019er.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot. I am the number one genius of the Pirate. Everyone knows the name Hai\u2019er. She is a rare and very talented person. I will be deified, one day.\u201d Hai\u2019er kept complimenting herself, showing utterly no embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIf you and I co-operate, it would be easier to traverse heaven.\u201d Hai\u2019er patted Han Sen on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re as good as you say, why do you need Speechless to guide you?\u201d Han Sen laughed at her.\n\nHai\u2019er\u2019s face did not change, and she said, \u201cI am certain I can get through it, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime affair. It\u2019s good to take extra precautionary measures, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nHan Sen turned around and left, ignoring her.\n\nHai\u2019er followed and pleaded, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it! State your conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what to expect in heaven, so following me is pointless.\u201d Han Sen knew Hai\u2019er was suspicious about the prospect of his relationship with Speechless, so he kept walking resolutely.\n\nHai\u2019er gritted her teeth and pulled out something. \u201cYou must know this. If you co-operate with me, then this is yours.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Hai\u2019er\u2019s hands and saw a tablet. It was palm-sized. There were many words, smaller than grains of rice, etched into it. There was nothing particularly special about it, though.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen looked at Hai\u2019er\u2019s tablet dubiously.\n\nHai\u2019er looked shocked. She stared at Han Sen, and said, \u201cReally? You don\u2019t know about the Virtual Tablet?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat is a Virtual Tablet?\u201d Han Sen looked at it and asked.\n\nHai\u2019er saw that Han Sen was honestly confused, so she shook it in front of him and said, \u201cThe Virtual Tablet is a powerful treasure left behind by a mysterious, higher race. It has that mysterious race\u2019s geno art. When the Buddha received the Virtual Tablet, they absorbed the talents to become as they are. Many geno arts have come from this Virtual Tablet. This is one of many. The Pirate unearthed it from some old ruins, and no one else knows about this. But it can be yours for the price of a co-operative partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know if this is real or not?\u201d Han Sen was curious.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you Knife Queen\u2019s student? If you let her take a look, she\u2019ll know the truth. She won\u2019t lie, either,\u201d Hai\u2019er said.\n\n\u201cOkay. If this is real, I will cross heaven with you.\u201d Han Sen took the tablet. Hai\u2019er had no relationship with Speechless, and she was practically giving him something for free. He wasn\u2019t going to reject that."
