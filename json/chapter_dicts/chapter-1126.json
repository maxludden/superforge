Again, five bugs had just immediately gone missing.\n\n\u201cAre there any cracks in the space of this place? Maybe they slipped into another dimension or something.\u201d Han Sen was shocked by what was going on.\n\nHan Sen was glad that he had not wandered into the valley himself.\n\nBut, wanting another look, Han Sen went away to collect more bugs. When he had a few more, he tossed them down towards the sands below.\n\nThe results were mostly the same, though. This time, Han Sen scattered the bugs all around, but they all still vanished. They were able to disappear from any corner of that valley, and not in just one spot.\n\nHan Sen spent more time conducting these tests, tossing dozens and dozens of bugs each time. Despite his best efforts to uncover what was going on, he was as clueless as when he began. His crack-in-space theory seemed unlikely, too, given that the bugs could disappear from anywhere. If there was a rip in space, it would most likely take the form of a single large hole.\n\nAlthough it was difficult to detect the presence of cracks in space, Han Sen\u2019s keen eyesight should have allowed him to notice the slight shimmering they often gave off. With no other clues or ideas about what might have been happening, the thought still weighed on his mind.\n\nHe didn\u2019t dare go to the valley himself, though. Han Sen remained above, watching from the top of a hill in safety.\n\nEventually, the stars rose and the moon gleamed brightly above the land. Despite the hours spent there, Han Sen wasn\u2019t able to deduce anything.\n\nThe region he was situated in was eerily silent, but he remained there stubbornly. He peered into every nook and cranny of that place, hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever was causing that peculiar phenomenon. Unfortunately for him, he learned nothing.\n\nIf there was a creature lurking beneath those sands, how could it have snatched the bugs without a trace?\n\nAs Han Sen\u2019s mind wandered, a rustle in the trees startled him.\n\nHan Sen looked into the forest that was a distance away and saw a man appear. It was Uncle Bug.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, not expecting to see Uncle Bug casually approach the valley on foot.\n\n\u201cHe said it was dangerous to come here. He warned me to stay away. Why is he coming here himself?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nUncle Bug was carrying a sack, and something seemed to be wriggling inside. Han Sen tried to determine what it was through a scan. All he could learn was that it was alive, and that it possessed a life force.\n\nUncle Bug approached the entrance of the valley and stopped. He peered across the sands of that place and tossed the bag onto the sands below.\n\nUncle Bug was strong, clearly. The sack was large, the size of a human. Despite that, he was able to toss it an entire kilometer.\n\nWhatever was in the sack looked to be panicking, and it thrashed around frantically after it came crashing down to the ground. Unfortunately, it had been sealed tight, and whatever was inside could not escape.\n\nHan Sen looked at the bag and thought to himself, \u201cWhat is inside that? Is he doing what I did? Is he trying to uncover what lurks inside this valley, too?\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, Han Sen heard the sound of a baby crying once more. It was incredibly sharp, just like Uncle Bug had told him.\n\nIt was unnerving and unsettling. The baby\u2019s sound was as if it had been traumatized. Han Sen then realized the sound was coming from the holes he had examined earlier.\n\nIn that Y-shaped valley, the holes were emitting the sound of a shrieking baby like speakers. The only unclear thing was which hole the noise was coming from.\n\nQuickly, Han Sen received his answer. After he listened closer, he realized that each and every hole was making the noise.\n\nThen, something even creepier occurred. Countless scorpions began to pour out of the holes. Thousands of the critters began to cascade from the sandy orifices, all heading for the bag and whatever was inside it.\n\nThe scorpions were about the same size of a fist. They were black, but without sheen.\n\nOn their backs was the faint picture of a human face. It was like that of a baby, giving off a creepy, devilish smile.\n\nWhen the scorpions moved, the smile looked like it was living and moving. It totally creeped Han Sen out.\n\nThe scorpions did not look strong, but they were scary enough to make Han Sen feel frightened.\n\nWhen Han Sen mustered the courage to scan them, he learned they were just mutant creatures.\n\nBut since there were all mutant creatures, even that group was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s only question was why they all came out when Uncle Bug threw down a prize.\n\n\u201cWhat is he up to?\u201d Han Sen looked at the scorpions and wondered.\n\nEventually, the human-faced scorpions reached the sack. Then, whatever was inside managed to roll out."
