    "text": "Ouyang Xiaosan was not shaken by Han Sen's words. staring at Han Sen, he was making his judgment based on his ability and experience.\n\nThere was no doubt that this was a white fist. Ouyang Xiaosan thought it was simply impossible to be a black fist.\n\n\"Verbal attacks would not work on me. This punch was not provocative at all, and would never be a black fist.\" Ouyang Xiaosan did not even move, calmly watching Han Sen's fist approaching.\n\nLike Han Sen, he did not even try to block it with his hands, because he was confident that this was a white fist.\n\nSince Han Sen did not really use his strength, his fist would stop when it got close to his face.\n\nDeep in his thoughts, Ouyang suddenly felt a soreness in his nose. And then he fell back involuntarily before he sat on the ground.\n\n\"How could it be a black fist?\" Ignoring his nosebleed, Ouyang looked blankly at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen offered tissues to Ouyang, and said with a smile, \"I told you so.\"\n\nOuyang did not take the tissues, but wiped the blood off his nose and stood up. He said firmly, \"Best of nine, that was just one.\"\n\nHan Sen smiled and put the tissues back. Standing opposite Ouyang, he said, \"I'll continue then.\"\n\nOuyang said nothing, staring at Han Sen. He would not miss his slightest movements, which were the basis on which he would make his judgment.\n\nOnce one used great strength, one's muscles would move. The key was to see through one's disguise.\n\nHan Sen looked at Ouyang who looked grim, pursed his lips and threw another punch.\n\nThis time, Ouyang had seen clearly that although Han Sen's muscles looked tightened, the direction of this punch would not be forward, which meant this could not be a black fist.\n\n\"This time you can't fool me.\" Ouyang stood firmly, raising his arms to block Han Sen's fist.\n\nAlthough he had judged this fist to be white, Ouyang still raised his arms. It seemed that he had taken Han Sen for a serious opponent, so he still prepared for the worst scenario when he was confident about his decision.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen's fist hit Ouyang on the arm. Ouyang's body shook but did not fall back.\n\nOuyang was pale since Han Sen's punch was still a black fist with enough strength. He was wrong.\n\n\"Two,\" said Han Sen with a smile.\n\nOuyang looked at Han Sen and was puzzled.\n\n\"Can he really hide his strength so well?\" Ouyang cast an odd look at Han Sen.\n\nBlack and white boxing was only a popular practice in martial arts, and the key was the yin and yang. There had only been matches of black and white boxing recently. Although it could not be regarded as the mainstream of martial arts, it was now quite popular. After all, it would make a great match to watch.\n\nOuyang had participated in a lot of black and white boxing games and seen a lot of black and white boxing masters. A lot of people had mastered yin and yang forces, but whenever they throw a punch, he could still tell.\n\nOuyang had rich experience and was particularly sensitive about his opponents\u2019 intentions, which was an advantage for him in black and white boxing games. Especially when he was the defensive side, the probability of his misjudgment was very low.\n\nEven if there were occasional mistakes, it would be because his opponent had used something he had never seen. And after he got familiar with it, it would not work anymore.\n\nBut in the two rounds against Han Sen, he had felt something different from all his previous experience.\n\nThat feeling was hard to describe. Han Sen\u2019s moves were misleading not only because of the false appearance of his body, but because Ouyang felt that Han Sen did not intend to hit him.\n\n\"There has to be flaws. If it is something unknown to me, I can always find out how it works. Once I do, he can no longer fool me.\" Ouyang calmed down, and got ready.\n\n\"Again.\" Ouyang slowly spit out the word.\n\nBang!\n\nHan Sen threw a punch and Ouyang raised his arms. This time Han Sen punched harder, but Ouyang could still stand still.\n\n\"You are very fit!\" Han Sen regarded Ouyang, surprised. Although he still reserved his strength, Ouyang would not be able to block it with a fitness index below 13.\n\nOuyang did not reply, because he lost again.\n\n\"Again.\" Ouyang was not discouraged.\n\nHan Sen threw another punch, and the result was the same--Ouyang took another black fist. This time, Han Sen deliberately weakened his strength, because he did not want people to know how good he actually was.\n\nTo do well in black and white boxing was not just about strength, but also about fooling your opponent.\n\n\"Four, this is your last chance,\" Han Sen looked at Ouyang and said.\n\n\"Go!\" Ouyang did not hesitate to say.\n\nHan Sen threw another fierce punch at Ouyang. It was as fast as a bullet.\n\nSuddenly, Ouyang moved away and dodged Han Sen\u2019s fist. At this critical time, Ouyang did not insist on his own judgment and tried to block, but chose to dodge.\n\n\"Since whenever I think you were using a white fist, you used a black one. Then if I act counterintuitively, I could beat you,\" Ouyang said with a smile of self-confidence.\n\nBut very soon, Ouyang\u2019s smile froze."
