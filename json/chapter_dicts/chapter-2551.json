I have things I need to ask them,\u201d Han Sen said to Elysian Moon, who was on the verge of taking Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s life.\n\nElysian Moon lowered her paper umbrella and looked expressionlessly at Ji Yang Sheng and the others. The three left alive were severely injured. Even from an idle glance, it was clear that they were in bad shape.\n\nBut they were restricted by the Dongxuan Area, so they couldn\u2019t have hoped to flee even if they tried.\n\n\u201cMr. Ji, what is this doll?\u201d Han Sen looked at Ji Yang Sheng, who was bleeding all over the place.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m already in your hands, you can kill me if you want. But I can assure you, I won\u2019t be giving you any information,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng said.\n\nHan Sen smiled. It looked as if the prince wasn\u2019t going to be doing any talking. Otherwise, he would have bargained instead of making heroic claims.\n\nHan Sen waved his hands, and the two half-deified Demons disappeared in a flash of rainbow light. They were reduced to nothing. Not even their bones remained.\n\n\u201cMr. Ji, tell me where the Demon Doll comes from, and I will let you live,\u201d Han Sen said slowly.\n\nA myriad of emotions passed over Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s face, but this time, he didn\u2019t speak with the certainty he had shown before. After a while, he said, \u201cIf I tell you, will you really let me live?\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cMr. Ji, although you are full of yourself, you are a pathetic ant in my eyes. Whether you die or not makes no difference in my life. Ergo, I don\u2019t really care what happens to you.\u201d\n\nJi Yang Sheng gritted his teeth and looked at Han Sen. It looked as if he had just made a big decision, and he said, \u201cOkay, I will tell you about the Demon Doll. But you must promise to let me go.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face looked cold. He didn\u2019t say anything. He lifted his hand, summoning a rainbow light.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell you! I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was so shocked.\n\nHe thought Han Sen had made a mistake by killing the other two Demons. Ji Yang Sheng thought that if he was the only one alive, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t kill him if he wished to know the secret of the Demon Doll. Therefore, Han Sen would be forced to bargain.\n\nBut now, he realized Han Sen had the power to kill two half-deifieds with ease. That meant the Demon prince could be killed easily, too. The secrets he held weren\u2019t worth much to Han Sen, in all likelihood.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me think you are lying. Otherwise, even if I don\u2019t want to kill you, I will have to kill you as punishment,\u201d Han Sen said to Ji Yang Sheng, his voice flat.\n\nHan Sen knew Ji Yang Sheng was a worm that only acted bravely. The man might have tried to maintain his image if his subordinates were around, so Han Sen took a shortcut and killed the other Demons before getting down to brass tacks.\n\nAnd now that he was the only one left alive, Ji Yang Sheng seemed a lot more willing to bargain. But even so, his attempts to negotiate were weak. His resolve had crumbled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Han Sen received the story of the Demon Doll from Ji Yang Sheng.\n\nJi Yang Sheng didn\u2019t know much about the Demon Dolls. All he knew was that they were created by the alpha. They had a strong vitality and a keen proficiency with Sky Demon powers. They were scarier than actual Demons.\n\nBut no one knew how the Demon alpha created the Demon Dolls or what materials were used to make them.\n\nPeople believed the Demon Dolls were crafted from Demon elites, but there weren\u2019t many Demon elites of that level of talent. In addition, no Demon elites were missing from the records. So, that couldn\u2019t have been the truth.\n\nEven the Demon society knew little about the Demon Dolls. Only the core supervisor would know about them. Not many Demons were given a Demon Doll by the alpha to use.\n\nDespite Han Sen\u2019s repeated questions and threats, Ji Yang Sheng hadn\u2019t revealed how the Demon Doll was created. It was probably something only the Demon alpha knew.\n\n\u201cHow many Demon Dolls are there?\u201d Han Sen seemed to know his captive wasn\u2019t lying, and so he asked this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. I know there are at least a dozen. The Demon alpha gave out a few Demon Dolls. There are still a few left in stock. I know of three deified Demon Dolls. The rest are half-deifieds.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was gushing secrets like a broken faucet in his desire to survive.\n\n\u201cThere are three deified Demon Dolls?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. The Demons weren\u2019t considered a big race these days. They weren\u2019t highly ranked among the higher races. Not only did they have deifieds in their midst, but they had three deified Demon Dolls. There could even be more. That was a scary thought.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Demons are stronger than we thought,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said after a moment of thought.\n\nHan Sen was thinking, too. \u201cThere sure is something a little sketchy about the Demon alpha. I bet those Demon Dolls are the shura kings that entered the geno universe via the Shura\u2019s Graveyard. That means there is a blood relation between the Demons and the shuras. But why did the Demon alpha turn them into Demon Dolls?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t understand, and so he asked Ji Yang Sheng how one could control a Demon Doll. The man\u2019s explanation was thorough.\n\n\u201cBut even if you do know how to control it, you need Sky Demon power to actually do it,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng said. But Han Sen had already activated the purple horn. The Demon Doll began to move. Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s mouth opened wide, and he could no longer speak.\n\n\u201cThis Demon Doll seems easy to use.\u201d Han Sen raised the purple horn, which was oozing purple smoke.\n\nAs long as Han Sen had that purple horn, he could use his will to control the Demon Doll. It could act out many commands. The doll was even able to perform simple actions by itself, so it didn\u2019t have to be controlled at all times.\n\n\u201cMr. Han, I told you everything you asked to know. I didn\u2019t lie once. Can I go now?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng asked Han Sen with sincerity. He looked so scared.\n\n\u201cWho said you could ever leave?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cYou said you would let me live! Are you going to break your promise?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was shocked, and his face looked very pale.\n\n\u201cI said I would let you live, but I didn\u2019t say I would let you go.\u201d Han Sen waved his hand and said, \u201cYou can be in charge of pulling my carriage in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling a carriage?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was confused. He didn\u2019t know what that meant.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the core area, a few Kings were hunting a xenogeneic. They were just about to kill it when they saw something coming toward them.\n\nThey stared for a long minute, confused, before they understood what they were seeing.\n\nThey saw a Demon coming toward them. There were ropes around the Demon\u2019s shoulders, and he was pulling something like a rickshaw.\n\n\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that the Demon Ji Yang Sheng? What is he doing?\u201d The Kings looked at the strange sight in shock. Most of them couldn\u2019t speak.\n\nJi Yang Sheng was pulling a bronze carriage. It didn\u2019t have a roof, but there was an umbrella shading the occupants. Inside the carriage were a man and two women. The beautiful women sat on either side of the man, like two wives flanking a king."
