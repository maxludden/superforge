In all the time that their race has lived here, very few outsiders have ever been able to access the Space Garden. Now it seems like they\u2019re letting everyone in. Don\u2019t you think that is a little suspicious?\u201d Dia Robber said as he sat down.\n\n\u201cIt really is quite suspicious. Do you know anything about what is going on?\u201d Xie Qing King asked with some curiosity.\n\nDia Robber shook his head. \u201cNot really. But from what I have experienced in the past, I am inclined to believe that this will be a very dangerous trip. Teacher Xie, you are a man of great knowledge. There is no need for you to risk your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fine. It is fine. There are some places I wouldn\u2019t dare to go, but with him protecting me, going to the Flower Gods should be okay,\u201d Xie Qing King said, tipping a thumb toward Han Sen.\n\nDia Robber could see the confidence Xie Qing King had in his guard, and so he looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cI have never formally met you before. Who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my bodyguard, San Mu. He is such a skilled fighter that he can battle two or three deifieds at once.\u201d Xie Qing King was bluffing and hyping Han Sen up already.\n\n\u201cSan Mu, if you have earned the admiration of Teacher Xie, you must be a very powerful person. I wonder where you are from, Brother San Mu.\u201d Dia Robber didn\u2019t use a geno art to analyze Han Sen, but he noticed that he couldn\u2019t feel or discern Han Sen\u2019s presence. That surprised him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just from a nameless race. You wouldn\u2019t know them, so it wouldn\u2019t matter even if I told you,\u201d Han Sen muttered, his voice dismissive and short.\n\nXie Qing King looked at Dia Robber and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. He has a bad temper. He\u2019s always like that, I\u2019m afraid. Even to his boss. There is nothing that can be done about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. People with power can get away with more than most. Just like Teacher Xie said: if Brother San Mu can beat three enemies at once, then it\u2019s understandable even if he is a little abrupt.\u201d Dia Robber let out a slight chuckle.\n\n\u201cEven though you say he is good, I think he is just good at bluffing and being a d*ck,\u201d said a provocative voice behind them.\n\nThe three of them looked over to its source, and they found that the voice had come from another table. There were two Extreme Kings, one of whom was the crown prince, Bai Wanjie.\n\nThe other person was a young girl. She had a very intriguing and powerful presence, but judging from her age, there was no way she could have been deified already. She was the one who had spoken.\n\nHan Sen and the other two at his table had experienced a lot in their lives. Unlike ordinary young people, they weren\u2019t easily riled. They weren\u2019t going to argue with a little girl. They just pretended not to hear her and resumed talking.\n\nThe little girl, upon seeing that her declaration received no response from Han Sen, grew bored with the thought of taunting them further. She stopped trying to rile others up.\n\nBecause Violet had needed to cram everyone into a small battleship, there were a lot of deifieds in one place. It was only natural that arguments might arise. Fortunately, everyone had assembled there for a singular purpose. Until they reached the Space Garden, no all-out fights would break out.\n\nHan Sen tried to memorize the route to the Space Garden, so he could recall how to get back there if he ever needed to.\n\nBut the battleship was moving too quickly. After a few space jumps, Han Sen lost track of where he was.\n\nOnce they entered the xenogeneic space of the Flower Gods, Han Sen finally understood why the place was called the Space Garden. What Han Sen saw was blankets of flowers covering sprawling meadows.\n\nThe flower fields looked like stairs rising between the clouds. There were loads of weird flowers scattered everywhere that Han Sen looked. All of them were xenogeneic plants of various levels. It was unbelievably pretty.\n\nThe ship parked next to the flower fields, and then, Violet brought them down.\n\nAfter they left the battleship, Han Sen smelled the scent of all those flowers. While the fragrance was very strong, it wasn\u2019t cloying or overbearing. It had a natural tinge to it.\n\n\u201cIs this a canna lily?\u201d Dia Robber asked suddenly, looking at a particular flower.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King followed Dia Robber\u2019s gaze. There was a flowery vine that was half a meter long. A few flowers had sprouted from the vine, and each bloom looked like a little girl practicing ballet. They looked very pretty.\n\n\u201cYes. That is a canna lily. You have a good pair of eyes.\u201d Violet gave Dia Robber a thumbs up.\n\nBut Dia Robber didn\u2019t seem to be happy about his discovery. In fact, he looked rather glum.\n\nAfter everyone\u2019s focus turned away from Dia Robber to move forward, Han Sen walked over to Dia Robber\u2019s side and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nDia Robber frowned and said, \u201cFrom what I can tell, canna lilies should be deified plants. They grow in very unique environments, and their powers are never weaker than a primitive deified xenogeneic. The Flower Gods just grow them randomly on the side of the road. Isn\u2019t that a little too strange?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is surprising to learn that the Flower Gods can grow deified plants with such ease,\u201d Xie Qing King said with a frown.\n\nViolet kept moving. Han Sen and the others walked past countless flowers and fields of grass. There were so many varieties of plants, and Han Sen could only recognize a tiny fraction of them. But judging from the lifeforce of the grasses and flowers, he could feel that they were nothing ordinary. They were all xenogeneic plants.\n\n\u201cNone of these plants are ordinary. No wonder the Flower Gods can create so many geno fluids.\u201d Han Sen kept looking around him. He didn\u2019t know what most of the plants were called, but he could tell from their lifeforce that they were some good stuff.\n\n\u201cThis is such a nice place. If we can take over this territory, we would never have to worry about resources. The xenogeneic plant resources here could feed 100,000 people,\u201d Xie Qing King murmured to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was thinking about something else, though. He ignored Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic plants bear fruit from time to time. As long as the seeds inside a fruit are not damaged, I can take them to the land of the fire phoenix to grow. I don\u2019t know how much that would reduce their growing time, though.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t imagine how much he would gain if he could accelerate the growth of plants like this. If he brought a few seeds to the extreme living land, he could reap enormous quantities of xenogeneic fruit in a short amount of time. Then, he would most certainly become rich.\n\n\u201cWe are nearing the place where the incident happened. Please be careful.\u201d Violet\u2019s footsteps slowed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we need to meet the leader of your race first?\u201d Dragon One asked with suspicion.\n\n\u201cThe leader and the others are already there,\u201d Violet said. He kept walking as he talked, so no one slowed down and they all continued following."
