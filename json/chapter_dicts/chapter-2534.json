    "text": "The Sea Sky Eye seemed to notice that its blue lights were unable to kill the knights, but it still lashed out angrily. It imbued its blue light with even greater strength. When the substance chains coming from the Sea Sky Eye seemed to reach their maximum power, the creature\u2019s blindingly bright body seemed to suddenly darken. A giant blue vortex formed around the creature and began sucking everything else toward it.\n\nThe King class elites blasted their power at the blue vortex in an attempt to disrupt its pull, but their efforts were fruitless. Not even the half-deifieds could resist the attractive force of the vortex. Under the power of that scary suction, they went flying forward.\n\nAs a few of the knights got sucked into the blue vortex, Bai Wan Jie suddenly shouted, \u201cNightmare, now!\u201d\n\nThe leader of the knights was drawing near the vortex. Hearing Bai Wan Jie\u2019s shout, he pulled out an item. Han Sen adjusted his scope to get a better view. The Extreme King leader was holding an object that looked like an old statue. The statue seemed familiar to Han Sen. After a second, he placed it.\n\n\u201cAn Ancient God Statue?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nThe statue blazed with light the moment that the man pulled it out. The light created a mysterious shadow that shielded Nightmare Knight. It also increased Nightmare Knight\u2019s power, giving him deified strength in an instant. A gold substance chain appeared around his body.\n\nThis Ancient God Statue was different from the one that Han Sen had seen before. This one was giving its user metal powers.\n\nNightmare Knight didn\u2019t hesitate. Once he had received the metal powers from the Ancient God Statue, he pulled out a metallic spear. Han Sen could see that the spear was laden with mysterious symbols. As the deified metal power flowed into Nightmare Knight, the symbols across the spear became very bright. Metal substance chains swirled around the spear, transforming the spear into an old, mysterious metal pillar.\n\nNightmare Knight roared and shoved the mysterious metal pillar into the blue vortex.\n\n\u201cAn Ancient God Statue and a deified treasure? The Extreme King are wealthy indeed!\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t blink. He just stared at Sea Sky Eye and the mysterious metal pillar. He wanted to see what would happen next.\n\nThat mysterious metal pillar looked like the weapon of some ancient sea deity as it was thrust into the blue vortex. When the pillar touched the vortex, the swirling blue power began to slow. The metal pillar was driven deeper and deeper into the vortex, and the blue power began to shine strangely. It was like a series of thunderbolts were striking the pillar. The creature\u2019s attacks failed to break the pillar, though. Cracks began to spread through space around the blue vortex, and every time the pillar sank another inch into the vortex, one of the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s substance chains fell apart.\n\nThe Sea Sky Eye seemed to have realized that something wasn\u2019t quite right. It wanted to retreat, but it was too late for that. The mysterious metal pillar has suppressed the vortex and pinned the creature in place. As the seconds ticked by, the pillar pierced relentlessly through the creature\u2019s defenses.\n\nHan Sen could see that the Sea Sky Eye wasn\u2019t going to last. Since the time had arrived, he quickly summoned the Gold Armor General beast soul. With his new beast soul cloaking his form, he headed straight for the Sea Sky Eye.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been flying for long when something changed within the Sea Sky Eye again. The blue vortex that had spun like water became ice. It froze the metal pillar that was half-way inside it.\n\nFrom afar, it looked like a long metal pencil sticking out of a giant blue eyeball. It was an extremely disturbing sight.\n\n\u201cAll of you! Deploy your power to push the pillar inside. We have to use it to suppress the Sea Sky Eye!\u201d Bai Wan Jie\u2019s face had become grim as he shouted the new command.\n\nThe royal knights reacted quickly. They hurled all of their scary powers at the end of the metal pillar, striking it like they were hammering in a nail. With each new explosion of power, they pushed the metal pillar deeper into the blue eyeball.\n\nAs the metal pillar went in, the cracks across the blue eyeball widened and spread. The eyeball was growing too weak. It was going to shatter.\n\nBai Wan Jie\u2019s eyes brightened as he watched the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s strength fail. He knew that success was within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nThey were sacrificing a great deal for this victory. It had taken the combined powers of an Ancient God Statue, a Sky God Pillar, and an Emperor Staff. The Sky God Pillar and Emperor Staff could be used again, but the Ancient God Statue was a one-time use item.\n\nAnd because he used the Emperor Staff, he had burned through a lot of the strength in his king body. He had used his body\u2019s power to activate the Emperor Staff, and using it for so long had cost him a lot of energy. He would be another year or two before he recovered his strength.\n\neCOV\n\nBut as long as he could get the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s xenogeneic gene, it would all be worth it.\n\nAs Bai Wan Jie\u2019s excitement grew, a gold light flashed by him. A gold form appeared behind the Sky God Pillar, drawing his attention.\n\n\u201cGold Armor General! Why is a Gold Armor General here?\u201d Bai Wan Jie\u2019s brain had no idea what to do with what he was seeing.\n\nAll the royal knights stared in shock, as well. They couldn\u2019t imagine why there was a Gold Armor General before them, so they had no idea how to react.\n\nFinishing off the Sea Sky Eye was taking all their power, and now a Gold Armor General had appeared out of nowhere. They had no clue what to do.Boom!\n\nBefore they could muster a reaction, Han Sen used the Gold Armor General to slam the Sky God Pillar\u2019s base. A glowing gold substance chain hurtled into the Sky God Pillar, shoving the pillar all the way into the Sea Sky Eye. A hole appeared in the moon-sized Sea Sky Eye.\n\n\u201cCore Deified Xenogeneic hunted: Sea Sky Core Eye. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nAs this announcement played inside Han Sen\u2019s head, he felt disappointed that he hadn\u2019t received a beast soul.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t stop, though. He drove the gold general into the big hole that the Sky God Pillar had opened up. As he flew, he saw a fist-sized blue eyeball. He grabbed it in his hand as he went through the body of the Sea Sky Eye. When the gold general emerged from the other side of the Sea Sky Eye, the creature\u2019s giant corpse suddenly collapsed. It shattered, spraying out like chips on blue ice. The explosion washed over the system like a quick, passing blizzard.\n\nHan Sen returned to the Sky God Pillar. As its power faded, it returned to its shape as a spear. The gold general grabbed it, then turned and raced off at full speed.\n\nBai Wan Jie and all the royal knights in the area had seen the bloody cape flying behind the figure. And they had seen the golden pipes spewing fire. The place now looked quiet and dead.\n\n\u201cGold Armor General stole the Sky God Pillar and the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s core gene,\u201d Bai Wan Jie seethed. When the shock wore off, he was so angry that he felt like he was about to vomit. He wanted to chase after the Gold Armor General, but it was too late to do so. The Gold Armor General was barely visible at this point; it was little more than a golden dot in the distance."
