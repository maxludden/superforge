    "text": "Han Sen kept swinging his Knife Blank, as if he was mowing down swathes of grass. He cut down endless numbers of Purgatory Beasts and the ghoulish arms.\n\n\u201cLittle Han, what are you using? That is exceptionally good.\u201d Wang Yuhang\u2019s mouth hung wide open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It might be useful right now, but it is difficult to tell how well it will fare if higher-level Purgatory Beasts rear their heads. Come on, let\u2019s run.\u201d Han Sen led everyone towards the hall.\n\nHan Sen knew the Knife Blank did not possess special powers. After all, it was simply the child of a knife, and it wasn\u2019t an actual knife. Its spirit was still weak, and it was still growing.\n\nBut that Knife Blank could very well be deified. That was because only items and weaponry of the same tier could defeat the Purgatory Beasts. That was how he was able to defeat the creatures and the arms.\n\nHan Sen still had to decide how hard he wished to hit each creature he came against, though.\n\nBlack Hell Cow\u2019s power was equivalent to that of a Viscount. Han Sen was able to kill their current enemies, but if they came up against something of an even higher level, it was likely he\u2019d end up performing like Han Meng\u2019er and Spell had. He\u2019d only be able to stagger the fiends, and not do any proper damage.\n\nHan Sen walked near Guna and Guya. They went at a meandering pace, so Han Sen went forward with Knife Blank. He killed everything he could see in his path. From arms to two-headed beasts to Black Hell Cows. Everything was slaughtered, and it allowed Guya and Guna to move at a faster pace.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before they arrived at the hall they wished to go to. When they got there, though, the situation gave them quite the shock. The hall had fallen. The gold Gana Goddess statue was still glowing, though, bathing the area in a light that forbade the entry of beasts and phantom arms.\n\nBut inside the hall, Han Sen saw six shadows. They were the King class elites that had previously escaped. Gold Jade King was there, too.\n\n\u201cI thought they ran off. Why have they come back?\u201d Han Sen looked at them with surprise.\n\nGuya said coldly, \u201cThey thought that since Purgatory Heaven does not have a deified elite to control it, they could escape before it was activated. Clearly, they miscalculated.\u201d\n\nHan Sen could guess this. After they left, they had hoped to escape the entire planet. Unfortunately, they could not. So, they had tried to destroy Purgatory Heaven.\n\nHan Sen had left the place before then, so he hadn\u2019t seen them return.\n\nThe six Kings were carrying with them a strange array of powers. The use of those powers seemed to be twisting and distorting the very dimension. They were doing their best to get close to the statue.\n\nGold Jade King\u2019s hand gripped a sword that looked very sovereign and prim. The sword was being thrust at the Goddess statue. Gold Jade King wielded it with finesse. It looked as if it could sever the atmosphere at any moment, but whenever it came within two meters of the statue, its approach was stalled. It became extremely slow, and no amount of effort could move it closer.\n\nThe Gana Goddess\u2019 gold light became solid. The powerful weaponry and powers wielded against it could not defy that tangible light. Nothing was even able to scrape the statue.\n\nGold Jade King wasn\u2019t the only one suffering this suppression, either. The same thing was happening to the other Kings there, as well.\n\nA beast King was trying to bite it in the air. The creature\u2019s fangs had the power to crush mighty objects, and it looked likely to break the statue with its maw. But it was ultimately unable to, as its bite was stopped two meters away. It did not matter how hard it tried, its power wasn\u2019t sufficient to deliver the attack.\n\nA giant-looking King was holding a mighty hammer. The hammer was coming down on the statue. Every swing broke the air, but it could not break the statue. It never got closer than two meters from it.\n\nAmidst those six Kings, Han Sen saw a bald monk. He wore monkish garb, like a robe. He struck the statue with the shadow of a buddha.\n\nThe same thing occurred to the monk as it did the other Kings, too. The godlight could not be broken.\n\nThe six wielded an extreme amount of strength. Together, they kept pounding on the statue. If it was a planet they were striking, it would have exploded many times over.\n\nIf they were unable to break the Goddess statue\u2019s godlight, the power gap between a deified being and a King must have been rather large.\n\n\u201cWhat about the Nobles in the hall?\u201d Han Sen looked around. Aside from the six Kings attacking the statue, they were all gone.\n\nGuya said, \u201cWhere the statue shines, there won\u2019t be any Purgatory Beasts and hellish hands. Ordinary people cannot withstand basking in that light for too long, though. I can only assume they were blasted and dragged into purgatory that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuna, is there a way to stop Purgatory Heaven?\u201d Han Sen asked Guna.\n\nGuna looked at the statue and the elites, and she said, \u201cI want to sacrifice myself, and hopefully obtain control of it that way. Then, I can ensure Guya gets out of Purgatory Heaven. In attacking the statue, however, they have increased its power output. Even if I do sacrifice myself, doing so now would be useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are so cruel! You only want to have Guya escape this place, while everyone else is left behind?\u201d Wang Yuhang was so mad!\u201d\n\nYou guys are not nice. Whoever comes here has a reason to do so. They want to use us,\u201d Guna hummed.\n\nThis is not the time to talk about this, so let me ask again: do you have a way?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cNo! The statue has been activated. Not even a King can get close to it. Unless someone deified is here, we will all die,\u201d Guna said.\n\n\u201cIs there no other way?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he looked at the statue.\n\nGuna hummed and said, \u201cYes. The other way is what the Kings are attempting. Break the godlight and take control of Purgatory Heaven the hard way; only then can you stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I control it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to control Purgatory Heaven if you don\u2019t have the blood of the Gana. The same would apply even if you were deified. But underneath the statue, there is a crack. You can escape Purgatory Heaven that way. That is what they planned to do, but they underestimated its power,\u201d Guna said, while pointing at the statue.\n\nHan Sen looked in the direction she pointed to. The end of the statue\u2019s tail did indeed possess a tear in the fabric of space. There was a long mark there.\n\n\u201cThat mark is where our deified elites fought their enemies. After a million years, it has yet to heal. That is why there is such a blatant flaw. Unfortunately, only deified elites can make use of it. King class elites cannot, so we most certainly can\u2019t,\u201d Guya said."
