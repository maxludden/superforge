    "text": "Ice Blue Knight King teleported after Han Sen with a fist brimming with power, and he thrust it forward against the Demon Bug King Bai Sema. The Bai Sema vibrated, but it showed no sign of cracking.\n\n\u201cThe shield can block Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s attacks. It really is powerful, but it cannot last forever. We should get ready to show ourselves soon,\u201d Edward said. He snuck out of the base and went after Han Sen.\n\nEdward had nothing to be afraid of. Ice Blue Knight King had disobeyed orders when he attacked Han Sen, and Edward technically had nothing to do with this. He would simply help the Knight King capture Han Sen and ensure his safety.\n\nAs Ice Blue Knight King pounded the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, Han Sen heard the shield groan as if it was going to shatter. It was like glass that had been strained to the breaking point. He frowned. \u201cIt looks like the Demon Bug King Bai Sema can block half-deified attacks, but not forever. It\u2019s a shame those other Demon Bug King Bai Semas are currently damaged. If I had those in play, the tri-colored Demon Bug King Bai Sema would definitely be able to block Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s attacks.\u201d\n\nHan Sen kept flying, trying to think of a way that he could shake off his pursuer. He knew simple speed wouldn\u2019t aid him in the long run. He had to find a way to escape before the Bai Sema broke.\n\n\u201cIf I can slip out of Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s vision and hide my presence, I can use Little Invisible to help me escape the rest of the way. But right now, doing that is too difficult,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen flew above a nearby mountain. Wherever they went, the creatures fled. The skies were filled with xenogeneics racing away in fear, and that surprised Han Sen.\n\nIce Blue Knight King\u2019s superior speed had allowed him to catch up quickly. Han Sen had a few ideas on what he could do, but he couldn\u2019t find a good opportunity to make any of them work.\n\nThe Bai Sema took more and more damage, and it looked likely to break. Ice Blue Knight King punched with increasing ferocity, but suddenly, a roar rang out from the mountain beneath them.\n\nBoom!\n\nA white light shot out from deep in the mountains. Its target was Ice Blue Knight King.\n\nIce Blue Knight King turned to block the incoming light, and there was a blinding collision of blue and white lights in the sky. Its force ended up destroying everything around them. Part of the backlash washed over the mountain, and then, a giant beast that was around a hundred meters long emerged. It sent more of that white power towards Ice Blue Knight King.\n\n\u201cEven God is helping me!\u201d Han Sen grinned and shot off into the mountains. The beast kept Ice Blue Knight King engaged, unintentionally stopping him from following Han Sen. The Knight King kept punching with more and more power, as if it was the only thing that could stop the annihilation of the world.\n\nThe entire mountain range shook as mountaintops and peaks fell from their lofts. The grounds were sundered while creatures fled.\n\nHan Sen rushed into a mountain and threw Bao\u2019er into Destiny\u2019s Tower. Then he dropped onto the ground and turned himself into a Stone Cow. He thundered towards a nearby crowd of xenogeneics.\n\nHan Sen was blending into the stampede of xenogeneics when he suddenly saw a shadow circle the mountain. It was Inspector Edward.\n\nEdward\u2019s eyes roved over the ground. It seemed as if he was on the prowl for Han Sen, too.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t look at Edward, hoping that the man wouldn\u2019t see through his disguise. He followed the xenogeneics deeper into the mountains.\n\n\u201cWeird. Where did he go?\u201d Edward frowned. He had seen Han Sen land in that area, but Edward\u2019s quarry had now vanished into thin air.\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s turned himself invisible? Even if he did, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to escape my eyesight. The mountain isn\u2019t too damaged, and there are no secret escape tunnels. His only option would be to walk out. So, the things that are currently leaving\u2026\u201d Edward\u2019s green eyes looked all around. After a while, he raced towards the group of fleeing xenogeneics.\n\nEdward looked very excited. His eyes brightened, and he spoke to himself, \u201cA powerful guy! He can even shapeshift. If he was also half-deified, I don\u2019t think I would be able to defeat him!\u201d\n\nWithout hesitation, Edward raced after the xenogeneics that were fleeing the area. He hovered right above them.\n\nHe looked down on the thousand xenogeneics, and the irises of his eyes turned to crystal as he examined them.\n\nEdward took one look and made a mental note of each and every animal that was there. In just a second, he noticed the problem.\n\n\u201cThat Stone Cow has disappeared.\u201d\n\nBut Edward didn\u2019t keep following the group of xenogeneics. Instead, he looked back the way he had come.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen Han Sen escaped Edward\u2019s vision, he used Little Invisible to leave the group of xenogeneics. He didn\u2019t go too far, though. He circled around and went back to where Ice Blue Knight King and that goliath were fighting.\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen headed straight into the deep hole that the beast had emerged from.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe that the monster\u2019s intervention was truly coincidental, but now, he was looking for a way to escape. There was a strong xenogeneic blocking Ice Blue Knight King, and he was going to take advantage of that.\n\nIt looked as if the fight between Han Sen and Ice Blue Knight King had disturbed the beast, but instead of coming after them both, the monster had decided to ignore Han Sen and go straight for Ice Blue Knight King. That seemed strange to Han Sen.\n\nHe ran into the abyss it had emerged from to have a look around, and he immediately noticed that the cavern wasn\u2019t the beast\u2019s home.\n\nIt looked very similar, but under the clarity gifted to him by the Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen could see the molecular traces of the beast. It had come to the cave recently, and it had only been there for a short time. It couldn\u2019t have been there any longer than two days.\n\nThe cave did house a powerful xenogeneic nest, but the molecular traces of the cave\u2019s original inhabitants were different. They didn\u2019t belong to the beast that had saved him.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Edward was willing to help me escape from Ice Blue Knight King.\u201d Han Sen ran deeper into the nest without hesitation.\n\nHan Sen was certain that all the creatures that should\u2019ve been living there were now dead. The beast must have had some kind of relationship with Edward.\n\nBut if Edward had sent the creature, then Han Sen sneaking into the lair of the dangerous beast should be the last thing he would expect.\n\n\u201cEdward\u2019s mind is pretty scary. He will come here sooner or later. I need to get out of here quickly,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he observed the nest.\n\nAfter entering the giant nest, Han Sen saw some large bones strewn about the cavern.\n\nMost people would have assumed that those bones were the remains of the beast\u2019s prey, but Han Sen could tell their true origin from the molecular traces. The bones belonged to the xenogeneics that originally lived there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this nest has another exit.\u201d Han Sen confirmed there were no other xenogeneics present, then decided to explore a little deeper into the nest."
