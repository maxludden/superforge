    "text": "Sky Palace Leader nodded to the Tenth Elder. \u201cIf I\u2019m correct, then it is what you\u2019re thinking. I cannot believe it was in Sky Palace all along. It was right under my nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 is it possible?\u201d Yun Changkong\u2019s voice trembled. He stared at Han Yan\u2019s jade box.\n\nThe jade box gleamed in the light. There weren\u2019t many adornments or engravings on it; it was a simple box, with no markings or patterns to identify it. Many Sky Palace elites wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell what it was.\n\n\u201cOld Yun, you should explain what is inside that jade box,\u201d the Sixth Elder couldn\u2019t help but ask.\n\nYun Changkong looked at Sky Palace Leader, who nodded. Yun Changkong\u2019s expression was difficult to read as he said, \u201cYou guys know about the Eleventh Leader, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The Eleventh Leader was a Sky Palace genius. Everyone knows about him. He was the strongest elite in Sky Palace that entered the geno hall.\u201d Sixth Elder rolled his eyes, but then his eyes widened and his face lost its color. \u201cIs this jade box related to the Eleventh Leader?\u201d\n\nYun Changkong nodded and said, \u201cYou guys should remember the records that were created before the Eleventh Leader went into the geno hall. He left behind words.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sword that will go to the luckiest person!\u201d many elders shouted at the same moment. Everyone\u2019s eyes opened wide. They stared at the jade box Han Yan was holding.\n\nYun Changkong nodded solemnly. \u201cThe Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skills were so fierce. He was like a god. He was a swordmaster from a family of swordsmen, and his talents brought him great strength. The Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skills were remarkable, even from a young age. He practiced with swords at the age of three years old. His swordmind reached the level of deified before he was twenty years old. He became the leader of Sky Palace before he was deified. When our race was in crisis, he destroyed traitors and battled enemies. Back then, even all the deified elders listened to him so they could make Sky Palace the best it could be. We have been stable for a billion years because of him. Referring to his lifetime as the Sky\u2019s \u2018Golden Age\u2019 isn\u2019t even enough to describe him. He was the one who left the inscription near Sky Pond that reads \u2018Outer Sky.\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecial people do special things. The Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skills weren\u2019t passed on to anyone else in Sky Palace. He didn\u2019t educate a single student. Before he went to the geno hall, he said, \u2018Fate will search the universe, and the sword will be given to the luckiest person.\u2019 But no one has ever figured out who that luckiest person might be. Until now, no one has found any sign of the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skills. But people always knew he left his sword around somewhere. Many people have searched for that treasure across the universe, but they always came up empty-handed,\u201d Yun Changkong said. He stared at Han Yan\u2019s jade box.\n\n\u201cHow do you know the jade box contains the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skills?\u201d the Sixth Elder asked with confusion.\n\nYun Changkong had a wry smile as he answered, \u201cThis jade box is made from Outer World Jade. It only exists in Sky Palace. It is so rare that no one else could have this much of it. Even if someone had some, they wouldn\u2019t come here and drop their Outer World Jade in the Sky Pond. Aside from our leaders, who else could do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been many leaders here over the years. How do you know this belongs to the Eleventh Leader?\u201d the Sixth Elder asked. He was still confused.\n\nYun Changkong pointed at the white elephant who was fast asleep near the Sky Pond. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what the Eleventh Leader\u2019s mount was?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard it was a Hitting Sky Elephant\u2026 but I thought the Hitting Sky Elephant disappeared when the Eleventh Leader went to the geno hall.\u201d When he realized what he was saying, the Sixth Elder trailed off in astonishment. His eyes opened wide as he looked at Han Yan\u2019s jade box. He screamed, \u201cIs that really the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should open it and find out,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\n\u201cLet me open it,\u201d the Sixth Elder said merrily. He walked close to Han Yan and tried to grab the box.\n\nBefore his hands could even touch the jade box, he felt a strong power come from behind. It sucked him backward.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Sixth Elder flew back through the air and slammed into the stone inscribed with the words Outer Sky. His face was almost crushed against the hard surface.\n\nThe white elephant near the pond had only moved his nose an inch. He didn\u2019t open his eyes. He was still sleeping.\n\nWhen Yun Changkong saw the other elder\u2019s shaken expression, he chuckled and said, \u201cBrother Six, you are in too much of a rush. Think about the Eleventh Leader\u2019s personality. He wouldn\u2019t allow just anyone to open his box.\u201d\n\nThe Sixth Elder stood up slowly, wincing in pain as he moved. He stared at the white elephant, but he didn\u2019t make any aggressive moves.\n\nIf the white elephant was the Eleventh Leader\u2019s mount, it would be stronger than a normal deified creature.\n\n\u201cHan Yan, open the box,\u201d Sky Palace Leader told Han Yan.\n\nHan Yan looked at Han Sen, and Han Sen nodded for her to do as she was told. Han Yan felt as if she had gotten quite lucky. This seemed to be a very rare opportunity that she had received, and maybe the Eleventh Leader had left behind great resources. If that was true, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have to struggle so much to level up.Han Yan held the jade box. It wasn\u2019t locked, so she lifted the lid and opened the jade box. A shadow flew out. It was in the shape of a gentleman.\n\nHis age would be difficult to guess, but he appeared to be rather young. He gave off an aura of someone who carried a great burden, however.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you guys never thought I\u2019d leave this behind at the bottom of Sky Pond. But don\u2019t worry. After all, you guys are my descendants. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to guess how my mind worked. Right now, whoever is in charge of Sky Palace needs to listen to me. The luckiest person, the person the white elephant selected, is the one who will receive my sword skills. Only that person can get what is inside this box. If anyone goes against this will of mine, bad luck will fall upon them. It is quite funny\u2026 I bet many creatures are looking all over the universe for this. I wonder which of the Sky was this lucky\u2026\u201d After saying that, the shadow disappeared. No one knew where it went.\n\nSky Palace Leader and the others looked strange. The legends said that the Eleventh Leader was a very heroic and smart man. They did not expect him to be such a\u2026 well, such a kid. It looked like he was quite the prankster.\n\n\u201cOld Elder, you are so unreliable. The white elephant chose a person who wasn\u2019t even one of the Sky. She is just a foreign student.\u201d Sky Palace Leader felt so depressed that he didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nAccording to the Eleventh Leader\u2019s words, the sword skills had to be given to Han Yan. The most secret skills of Sky Palace were about to be hers. If they didn\u2019t give the skills to her, that would mean they were betraying the will and direction of the Eleventh Leader. That decision would reflect poorly upon them.\n\nThe most important thing, however, was the fact that the Eleventh Leader\u2019s mount was still there. The white elephant was bound to intervene if they tried to take the knowledge away from Han Yan.\n\nAll the elders of Sky Palace looked confused. None of them said a word."
