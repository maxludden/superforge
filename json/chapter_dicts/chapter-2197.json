Give it to me, and I will permit you to live.\u201d The Taurus began to approach Huangfu Jing, lifting his creepy weapon to point it at her threateningly.\n\nThe weapon looked very strange. It was roughly the shape of a greatsword, but the back of the greatsword had a rectangular slot. Inside of that slot, there was something that looked like a string.\n\nHuangfu Jing gave no response, so the Taurus Marquise looked at her murderously. He unleashed a strike in her direction.\n\nThat strike was strong. The string in the slot moved and made a sharp sound.\n\nHuangfu Jing dodged it. She immediately flowed into her Heavenly Go and phoenix movements, the latter of which she had learned from Han Sen. Just as she was about to evade that swordstrike, she suddenly realized that a sonic attack was coming for her, as well. It struck her, and it made her body shake. Her brain felt as if it had been prodded with a number of prickly needles.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe disorientation allowed the sword to hit Huangfu Jing\u2019s body, and the blow sent her flying away. Blood trailed behind her through the air.\n\nFortunately, Huangfu Jing was incredible capable at evasive maneuvers. She had a strong will, too, so after that sonic attack, she immediately returned to dodging. If she hadn\u2019t done this, her arm would have been hacked off.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to cut your limbs off one by one, then give me the Jade Drum.\u201d The Taurus Marquise\u2019s eyes looked to be on fire. His four legs sprinted towards Huangfu Jing, and his arms lifted the greatsword above his head.\n\nAnd then, the shadow of a red beast appeared behind him. It roared as the greatsword moved. And as this occurred, the sonic powers surged angrily into her brain.\n\nHuangfu Jing wiped the blood off of her face and slipped back into her Heavenly Go movements to avoid her foe.\n\nBzzt!\n\nHuangfu Jing felt as if her brain was being stabbed by knives. It almost left her paralyzed. Still, she managed to dodge the strike and avoid getting hit.\n\nThe Taurus Marquise saw Huangfu Jing evade his greatsword, and he frowned. He looked angrier than ever, following that.\n\n\u201cIt is useless!\u201d he barked. \u201cWith my sonic sword, you will not live. Your only hope is to give me the Jade Drum.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the greatsword came swinging at Huangfu Jing with even more speed. The sound emitted by the string grew louder and louder.\n\nHuangfu Jing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all, though. She calmly looked at the Taurus Marquise, and then her body began to change.\n\nHuangfu Jing had a geno armament, which had come after she initially obtained a geno armor. Just like Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra, it provided her with an entire set of armor.\n\nThe gold geno armament clad her entire body. Although it was just an Earl set, it was still very powerful. It was no weaker than the armors possessed by the very top Earls.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the scariest thing about her. A strange power started to brew within the gold armor. It changed her actual body.\n\nA gold light began to shine from her armor, and the armor itself began to look like red steel. She looked as if she had just emerged from a pool of lava.\n\nThere was no heat coming off of her, though, and the growing power remained contained by the armor. It made her shine gold.\n\nDong!\n\nThe greatsword slashed, but this time, Huangfu Jing did not dodge. She raised her arm and grabbed the falling blade. That slashing power was brought to a dead halt by Huangfu Jing\u2019s hand. The blade came to a standstill, and despite the force the Taurus was using, the blade refused to descend any further.\n\nThe gold-looking hand was glowing, and a flurry of sparks spewed out from the point of contact. The Taurus stared with wide eyes. He could not believe an Earl had managed to block his sword. He was so angry that he couldn\u2019t help but roar. As he held his greatsword, he began to apply even more force in a bid to drive it downwards.\n\nHuangfu Jing\u2019s eyes shone, and the gold light radiated powerfully from her form. Her other hand was like a blade then, and it came across her body to slash the assaulting greatsword.\n\nPang!\n\nThe greatsword\u2019s string snapped under Huangfu Jing\u2019s strike, and the sharp noises were at last brought to an end. But the force drove Huangfu Jing to her knees on the ground.\n\n\u201cEven without sonic powers, killing you will be a satisfying endeavor!\u201d the Taurus thundered. His muscles were bulging, and his shadow looked furious. The greatsword came slashing down at the half-kneeling Huangfu Jing.\n\nEven as the greatsword came bearing down on her, Huangfu Jing remained absolutely calm. And then, she moved. She ignored the incoming strike of the greatsword as her gold fist punched up towards the Taurus.\n\n\u201cD*mn!\u201d The Taurus Marquise looked upset, but he was still greedy. He had only aimed for her hand. He didn\u2019t want to kill her just yet. He needed her to locate the Jade Drum for him, after all.\n\nJust as the greatsword was just about to hit Huangfu Jing, her body suddenly disappeared. She teleported behind him, and her fist was driven into the back of his head.\n\nPang!\n\nThat brightly-lit fist hit the back of the Taurus\u2019 head like a hammer. It broke through his protection and wrecked his helmet.\n\nThe Sagittarius was both shocked and enraged, and so he hastily swung his sword behind him.\n\nBut the greatsword found no target. It couldn\u2019t touch her, as her body teleported to his left side. A powerful leg swung toward his neck with the ferocity and speed of a hunting cat.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe glowing leg was like an ax as it came forward to strike his neck. The leg broke the armor of his neck and drew blood from his flesh.\n\nHuangfu Jing did not stop, though. She appeared all around him, striking like a killing machine. She attacked him with her fists, fingers, elbows, legs, and knees. She left the Taurus an abundance of wounds. His armor kept breaking further and further with each hit.\n\nThe Taurus Marquise looked as shocked as some stupid bear. No matter how much he struggled now, he wasn\u2019t able to attack Huangfu Jing, and every attempted counterattack just ended with him getting hit again.\n\nThe Taurus was covered in his own blood. Anger, fear, and hopelessness were painted all across his face. It made him scream in pain.\n\nBoom!\n\nAmidst those crazy attacks, the rest of the Taurus\u2019 armor broke. Huangfu Jing ripped his head off completely, and the headless body slumped to the floor, squirting blood.\n\nHuangfu Jing settled herself back down on the floor. Her face hadn\u2019t changed at all. The light glowing from her faded gradually, until she looked like her usual self again.\n\nHan Sen had arrived in time to witness Huangfu Jing make use of her super god body. Her performance really impressed him. \u201cKiller Queen\u2019s super god body is real. The unlimited teleporting ability will be more than enough to carry her through this universe.\u201d"
