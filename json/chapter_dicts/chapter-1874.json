    "text": "Han Sen carried Guna back to the ship and secured a spot for Meng\u2019er.\n\nHan Sen had thought Icebird Duke would be able to collect some Nobles during his absence, even if they were merely Barons. Things hadn\u2019t turned out quite as he\u2019d expected them to, though.\n\nToo many factions were there with the desire to recruit the Gana. They all had the same idea that Han Sen did, too. Even if they could not recruit the Gana, no one wanted to return home empty-handed.\n\nMany factions had tried securing the services of a Baron, and very few Barons would settle for the low aspirations of fledgling factions like Han Sen\u2019s. They wanted big groups, and the big groups happily chose them. Even if they wanted to join the Rebate, it was far more likely they\u2019d join the Gold Jade King instead.\n\nHan Sen had been gone for a long time, but despite that, no Barons had been recruited.\n\nNot long after, Dragon Lady brought Wang Yuhang along. The workers on the ship were very happy to see a Baron come to join them. But Dragon Lady requested that Wang Yuhang go along with her, and if not, she would not lend them her services.\n\nIf this was another planet at war, Barons couldn\u2019t make such demands. But in these circumstances, if recruiters did not honor such requests, they wouldn\u2019t have much success.\n\nHan Sen made a speech that allowed them to stay. The workers complied, and the two were led on board.\n\n\u201cIcebird Duke, it is way too difficult to recruit people here. We should go to another planet.\u201d Han Sen hid Guna in his room, and he didn\u2019t fancy staying around any longer than he had to.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Icebird Duke knew this would happen. She had warned Han Sen before they even arrived. But instead of rubbing it in, she simply agreed with him.\n\nWhen the ship started to fly off, many airships suddenly started to surround it.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped in his chest, and he thought to himself, \u201cDid something happen? Did they see me sneak Guna on-board? It looks like I can\u2019t do bad things and expect to get away with it. I just want her help. It wasn\u2019t as if I was going to harm her, though. Karma is biting me back pretty quickly\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen kept fretting about potentially being exposed. And if this was the truth, he wondered how he might make it out alive.\n\nHan Sen saw there were many Kao on the airship. So, Icebird Duke went out and spoke to their leader.\n\n\u201cIcebird Duke, what do they want?\u201d Han Sen asked, after nervously waiting for her to return.\n\nIcebird Duke gave Han Sen an invitation, and then she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this, but the Gana are actually controlled by the Kao now. The Kao are looking to sell some. So, they have invited us to an auction.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? How did they manage that?\u201d Han Sen now knew it wasn\u2019t just Guna who had been captured. The whole of the Gana populace had likely become prisoners.\n\n\u201cJudging from the current situation, I am afraid only the Kao can accomplish this with the Gana. The other factions could not try, because they were watched. If they struck, others were sure to know,\u201d Icebird Duke said.\n\nThose Kao are conducting auctions? They really think that after the auction is complete, they can take the money they amassed and leave?\u201d Han Sen lifted his lip.\n\n\u201cMaybe they have brain damage? Or maybe they\u2019ve got a powerful backer? Regardless, this is none of our business. After all, you lack sufficient funds to take part in such an auction.\u201d Icebird Duke knew the state of Han Sen\u2019s finances.\n\nHan Sen was practically broke. He hadn\u2019t been producing enough xenogeneic materials and genes to sell. He had also been taking much of what they collected back to the sanctuary to feed his family and friends. Because of that, he had nothing for the auction.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should go, just so I can at least learn a thing or two?\u201d Han Sen thought that if he left now, it would be too obvious.\n\nIf he was there for the Gana and didn\u2019t even bother showing his face in an auction, his actions might be considered suspicious.\n\nIf the Gana had been defeated and were unable to protect themselves, no one would guess Guna was there, and so his secret would be safe. Han Sen thought he\u2019d join the auction to at least keep himself from drawing suspicion.\n\nBack in his room, Han Sen used hidden mode. He wouldn\u2019t allow voices or videos to be sent outside his room. He also let Little Invisible jump off of Guna\u2019s head.\n\nThe bed was colorful in the room, and that was where Guna appeared. Her body was cuffed to the bed, and her mouth was gagged. Only her tail could move.\n\n\u201cLet me go. If anyone finds out that I am here, you will be very dead.\u201d Guna looked fairly angry.\n\n\u201cLet me give you the bad news and the good news. The bad news? Well, all of the Gana have become prisoners. And tomorrow, they\u2019ll all be auctioned off! The good news? You don\u2019t have to go to this auction and face slavery. You will become mine,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cNo way. You can\u2019t lie to me!\u201d Guna\u2019s eyes were open wide.\n\n\u201cNo way? Then how did you end up captured by Gia?\u201d Han Sen brought out his invitation and showed it to her.\n\nShe was tied up, but her tail was free. With it, she opened the invitation and stared at it with wide eyes that refused to shut.\n\nThose traitors!\u201d Guna looked even angrier.\n\nYou are lucky that you aren\u2019t being sold off. Follow me and I will treat you well. I promise that you won\u2019t face a slave\u2019s treatment.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Guna looked rather confused as she asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cNothing. I am only here to recruit. You should know the rules of the Rebate, though,\u201d Han Sen said, seeming to switch subjects abruptly.\n\nGuna looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cYou are not a Rebate, though. You are an outsider, clearly. I think it is more than rare for an outsider to collect members for a faction. I think there are only a few who do this sort of thing. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutdated news, lady. I am Knife Queen\u2019s student. She\u2019s the leader of the bunny bunch. Of course I have permission to recruit people here.\u201d Han Sen smiled, and then went on to say, \u201cWhen I boarded the ship, did you not see the Rebate around? Did you not see the respect and politeness they showed me?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnife Queen has taken an outsider for a student?\u201d Guna could hardly believe it.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, it does not matter to me.\u201d After that, Han Sen lay down on the bed next to her.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Guna was shocked, and she wished to avoid him. But she was tied up on the bed, and she was unable to move.\n\n\u201cWhat else would I do aside from sleeping?\u201d Han Sen was lying on the bed, and he looked at Guna as he spoke.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. I would rather kill myself.\u201d A shiver ran down Guna\u2019s spine when her eyes met with Han Sen\u2019s stare. She had heard a lot of races outside her own were quite\u2026 sick.\n\nHan Sen smiled and grabbed her jaw."
