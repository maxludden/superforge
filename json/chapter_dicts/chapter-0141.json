    "text": "\"I did not expect that a cheater could actually be admitted to Blackhawk. Has the school lowered its standards?\" Ji Yanran thought as she walked and made no connection between Han Sen and My-Girlfriend-Is-Ji-Yanran.\n\nIn her mind, Han Sen was a cheater and nowhere near a master.\n\nSoon, Ji Yanran saw Han Sen was behind her, so she turned around and frowned at him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I'm going back to my dorm. You think I\u2019m following you?\" Han Sen rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Which department are you in? Where is your dorm?\" Ji Yanran refused to believe him.\n\n\"Archery Department, Building E10 Room 304.\" Han Sen smiled at her.\n\nJi Yanran paused, for Han Sen's dormitory was really this way. And the building where Han Sen lived was right behind her building.\n\n\"Archery Department, no wonder you can be admitted to Blackhawk. Cheater in games and cheater in the entrance exam,\" Ji Yanran said.\n\n\"Why are you treating your boyfriend like this?\" said Han Sen helplessly.\n\n\"You can save that comment when you could beat me, cheater,\" Ji Yanran said.\n\n\"Piece of cake. I can do it now if you wish.\" Han Sen was a little annoyed by being called a cheater.\n\n\"Want to cheat again?\" Ji Yanran said with disdain.\n\nHansen was speechless. \"You said I cheated, and refused to let me prove it to you. What do you want?\"\n\n\"If you really have what it takes, we could have a match on the professional holographic training machine tomorrow,\" Ji Yanran said confidently.\n\n\"Well, give me your comlink number. I'll contact you tomorrow,\" Han Sen smiled and said.\n\nJi Yanran rolled her eyes, \"Don\u2019t try to get my number. Tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, I will wait for you in Building E16 Room 138.\"\n\n\"Well, I will go. Wait to become my girlfriend.\" Han Sen laughed.\n\nJi Yanran did not talk to him again and walked away.\n\nThe next afternoon, when Han Sen was ready to go, Qin Xuan suddenly gave him an order to go back to Steel Armor Shelter for an important task.\n\nHan Sen had to give up the plan to meet Ji Yanran and teleported to Steel Armor Shelter.\n\nAlthough he would like to inform Ji Yanran, she did not tell him her number, so he had no way to do it.\n\nJi Yanran went there at three o'clock and waited, but saw no one there. She was even more convinced that he was a cheater.\n\nHan Sen came back after two days, and there was still no way to contact Ji Yanran. He did not worry about it too much and continued to study according to his own plan.\n\n\"Everyone, I have something to say.\" Fatty cleared his throat and said, holding a stack of paper in his hand.\n\n\"President, we can hear you,\" replied Shi as he was training on a holographic machine.\n\nOther people were also doing their own thing. Feeling helpless, Fatty said, \"In a few days, Starry Cup will begin and as a society of warframe, we must register for some warframe items. Let\u2019s see which ones we should go for.\"\n\n\"You are the president. You decide,\" Lu Meng had nothing to contribute.\n\nZhang Yang was zealous, \"Of course all of them.\"\n\n\"The number of our members would not even cover all the items.\" Wang Mengmeng blinked her eyes and said.\n\n\"We are the Heavy Warframe Society, so we will fall short to the Warframe Society in many items,\" Li Zhenzhen said.\n\nWang Chun added, \"For the items in combat, we will not do well. And we haven\u2019t even practiced the five-on-five team combat and will be much worse than the Warframe Society.\"\n\n\"That is challenging, but as long as we unite as one, we will be able to win.\" Zhang Yang was full of self-confidence.\n\nFatty looked to Wang Mengmeng, \"Which ones should we apply for?\"\n\nWang Mengmeng looked at Han Sen who was reading, \"Brother Han, what do you say?\"\n\n\"That Starry Cup, what is in it for the champion?\" Han Sen pondered and asked.\n\nSkinny quickly said, \"Of course. The prize depends on the item and all top 3 will get something. Of course, the champion\u2019s prize is the best. For example, all members of the champion team of the five-on-five combat will gain a warframe of the Starbeast series, which was worth more than a million each. The champion of the single combat will win the lastest warframe of the King series, which has a value of nearly ten million.\"\n\n\"There are prizes for the top 3 of all items. We should try our best. Even if we don\u2019t win anything, it would be a great opportunity for us to practice,\" Fatty said.\n\n\"Let\u2019s register for all then.\" Han Sen heard there were so many awards paid by Starry Group and decided to try.\n\n\"For real?\" Fatty looked to Wang Mengmeng again.\n\n\"If Brother Han says so.\" Wang Mengmeng thought about it and asked, \"It there any overlaps between these items? Can one show up in all of them?\"\n\nFatty checked the schedule and said, \"There is no problem other than one item, which is a single item, so one of us could go for that.\"\n\n\"Well then. Our president will take care of the registration.\" Wang Mengmeng said with a smile.\n\n\"Mengmeng, will this work? Our society has so few people, and almost all of us are freshmen. Would it look too bad if we lost in everything?\" Li Zhenzhen said with some concern.\n\n\"It does not matter. With Brother Han here, we will not lose.\" Wang Mengmeng had blind trust in Han Sen.\n\nLi Zhenzhen and Wang Chun cast an odd look to Han Sen. They could not tell what was so special about this freshman that Wang worshiped him so much.\n\nThey had also asked Wang Mengmeng about it and Wang simply said she had known him all her life and he had always been an impressive person.\n\nBut Li Zhenzhen and Wang Chun were quite skeptical about it, since they had not seen any excellent performance from him.\n\nAnd Han Sen had been practicing on heavy warframes instead of combat warframes these days, so it would be unrealistic to say he would get any prize."
