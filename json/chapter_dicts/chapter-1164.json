If they did not leave in that time, their bodies would be damaged.\n\nBut when they left the tree, the effects of the walnuts would wear off and they\u2019d return to their proper size.\n\nSo, Han Sen thought he shouldn\u2019t squander any more of his time there.\n\nIf Han Sen was able to go up one level, he\u2019d receive a drop of the prestigious lifewater. It seemed like a goal worthy of pursuing. When he reached the second floor\u2019s entrance, he stepped forward while no one else did.\n\n\u201cNew human?\u201d the guard asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nThe spirit pointed at a circular shield on a wall and said, \u201cIf you break the shield in under ten minutes, you will have passed the test.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised to hear this was the test, and so he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t I need to fight you guys?\u201d\n\nThe spirits said, \u201cYou are an ignorant fellow, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019d kill you in one hit, but the emperor doesn\u2019t allow that. So, go and attempt to break that shield. Next time, things won\u2019t be so easy.\u201d\n\nBeing given the task of breaking the shield was a one-time, first-time affair. Not wanting humans to be killed outright made it seem as if the emperor was in dire need of more staff.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Zhang Yuchen was limping towards Han Sen, seeking to stop him.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Han Sen asked with surprise.\n\nZhang Yuchen told him, \u201cYou are only given one chance to break the shield and level up that way. If you fail, trying to reach the second floor will be far more difficult in the future, as you\u2019ll be subject to a crueler challenge.\u201d\n\nThe spirits chimed in to mock, saying, \u201cThe test has already started. You\u2019d better hurry, as you only have seven seconds left.\u201d\n\nZhang Yuchen exclaimed, \u201cOh, no! If you miss out on this opportunity, I have no idea how many years it might take for you to level up.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive seconds,\u201d the spirit said, with a happy expression.\n\nHan Sen patted Zhang Yuchen on the shoulders and said, \u201cThanks for letting me know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I was too late,\u201d Zhang Yuchen said, remorsefully.\n\n\u201cIt might not be.\u201d Han Sen walked towards the shield.\n\n\u201cThree seconds,\u201d the spirit said, before starting a countdown.\n\nHan Sen was not in a rush, so he approached the shield slowly.\n\n\u201cTwo seconds. If you don\u2019t hurry, you won\u2019t even be able to get a single punch in,\u201d the spirit said.\n\nZhang Yuchen regretted talking to Han Sen now, as he had cost him much time.\n\nHan Sen just smiled and gave the shield a slight nudge.\n\nPang!\n\nThe shield blew up into little pieces.\n\nEveryone all around was shocked, and the spirit frowned, saying, \u201cThe shield must have been on the verge of collapse. It has been there a long time, after all.\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cGo and rest, Brother Yuchen. When I receive some lifewater, I\u2019ll come back and share it with you.\u201d\n\nZhang Yuchen, with a wry smile, slinked away.\n\nHan Sen thought the man was quite strange. Han Sen had succeeded, but he had left without saying anything.\n\nStill, he let him go for now. Han Sen was going to talk to him when he was done.\n\n\u201cCan I go now?\u201d Han Sen asked the guards, pointing towards the stairs that led up.\n\n\u201cSure, whatever.\u201d The spirit was not happy over the way Han Sen won, but the rules were the rules. He wasn\u2019t going to prevent Han Sen from proceeding. It seemed as if the emperor ruled his subordinates well.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my lifewater?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe spirit threw a bottle at Han Sen, but he did not say a word.\n\nHan Sen caught it. It was transparent, and a honey-looking drop of liquid resided within.\n\nHan Sen put it away and started to ascend the stairs.\n\nEach floor looked the same as the last. The buildings and architecture were identical to the floors below, and each floor was populated by a number of creatures and spirits.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived on the next floor, a spirit said, \u201cWait here; a spirit will come and put you to work soon.\u201d\n\nHan Sen saw a few creatures waiting ahead of him; they were the ones who had passed the test.\n\nHan Sen knew that the people who came here would have to work for one day.\n\n\u201cCan I keep on climbing?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course, but you need to finish your duties first,\u201d the spirit coldly said.\n\nHan Sen waited in line with the creatures. It was an emperor shelter, so who knew how many elites might have been living there. Han Sen didn\u2019t want to push his luck and try to subvert the rules.\n\nAfter a while of waiting, a spirit approached and guided them to another section of the floor.\n\nHan Sen knew why, as they\u2019d have to have their strength tested. If you were weak, you could not perform the task expected of you.\n\nHan Sen looked ahead and saw a mountain of walnuts there. They surprised him quite a bit.\n\nThe walnuts were purple in color, so they had to be from that tree. There were creatures in a chain-gang, pushing a stone mill, grinding them into dust.\n\nThe stone mill was very heavy, and the primitive creatures were having a difficult time operating it.\n\n\u201cNew human?\u201d Han Sen was sent to a stone mill. Another human stood next to him and tried to strike up a conversation, but Han Sen ignored him to focus on the work."
