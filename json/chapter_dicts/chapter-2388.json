    "text": "Han Sen wasn\u2019t interested in selling his ticket of admission to Destiny\u2019s Tower, which greatly disappointed Bai Ling Shuang. Luckily, she didn\u2019t push the subject any further.\n\nTwo days later, someone from the palace arrived to give Han Sen his exam rewards. The reward was a little different than Bai Ling Shuang had predicted, though.\n\nHan Sen received the pass that would grant him admission to Destiny\u2019s Tower, but he wasn\u2019t given the deified treasure Bai Ling Shuang had mentioned.\n\nAfter Han Sen considered the issue for a moment, he thought that he understood. Perhaps King Bai was still suspicious, so he withheld the deified treasure typically given to whoever came in first.\n\n\u201cBeing given permission to enter Destiny\u2019s Tower is still a great reward. I\u2019m excited to see if that Destiny\u2019s Tower is the same or different from mine.\u201d Han Sen had been curious about the Destiny\u2019s Tower of the Extreme King since he first learned that it existed.\n\nAfter he sent the officers away, Han Sen slid the pass into his pocket and went to visit Destiny\u2019s Tower. He wasn\u2019t personally in a rush, but he was afraid Fox Queen might learn that he had been given the pass. She would find him quickly, and she would ask him to steal something from the tower, no doubt. That would be way too risky.\n\nAfter going to Destiny\u2019s Tower, Han Sen understood why it was so difficult to gain permission to go there. The Extreme King didn\u2019t want many people to learn the secrets within Destiny\u2019s Tower, for one. But there was another reason. Opening Destiny\u2019s Tower required the strength of four deified elites. All four had to combine their strength in order to open the door enough for one person to pass through.\n\nEvery time Destiny\u2019s Tower was opened, the four deifieds would end up exhausted. It would take them two to three months to recover, and it cost them a very rare and special material.\n\nAlthough Han Sen had received the permit allowing him to enter Destiny\u2019s Tower, he would have to register before he could use it.\n\nAfter Han Sen sorted out all the registration forms, he was told he would be allowed access in seventeen days. He had to be there on time. If he was one second late, he would lose his permission to enter Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nHan Sen was depressed, but he knew the seventeen days would go by quickly. It was a statement of the Extreme King government\u2019s power that they had four deified elites standing by to open the door. In most races, who knew how long it would take to gather up four deified elites.\n\nBut because of the delay, Han Sen lost all hope of avoiding Fox Queen.\n\nAs soon as he came home, he found the flirty Fox Queen lying in his bed. Her eyes were like moons as she smiled at Han Sen. \u201cMy good brother, did you register to enter Destiny\u2019s Tower?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is done.\u201d Han Sen slumped his shoulders and moved to sit on a chair.\n\nFox Queen stood up and walked over to Han Sen. She wrapped her arms around Han Sen from behind and let her fingers draw circles across Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\nHan Sen felt something soft press against his back. Her beautiful face brushed against his, and her red lips came next to his ear and whispered, \u201cHelp me smuggle the Fox treasure out of Destiny\u2019s Tower, and I will treat you very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t want to help\u2026 I\u2019m just afraid that if I do, I\u2019ll never again have the chance to talk with you again,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nFox Queen laughed. She pulled Han Sen\u2019s cheek down onto her chest and said, \u201cWhy would I let you die? I have a way in which you can steal the item, and no one else will ever know. No suspicions will be flung your way. After that, I can help you leave the Extreme King. Then, the Fox race will be greatly indebted to you. If you want, you can come back to the Foxes with me. After all, we have many pretty women for you to spend your time with.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. I am so unlucky, there\u2019s no way I could be fortunate enough to end up in that situation. Why don\u2019t you tell me about this Fox item in Destiny\u2019s Tower? What is the plan for stealing it?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nFox Queen looked very sad. She moved around the chair and sat on Han Sen\u2019s lap. Leaning against Han Sen\u2019s neck, she sighed. \u201cI was trapped inside Ghost Bone Palace for too long. After I got out, I realized that the universe of today is vastly different from the universe I used to know. The Extreme King used to be the Sacred Leader\u2019s slaves, but now they\u2019ve become one of the highest races. While the Foxes didn\u2019t fall, our treasure was claimed by the Extreme King. Because of that, my people have been unable to break through and become deified. We have had to use our beauty just to survive.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Fox Queen went on to say, \u201cI have been gathering intel since I left Ghost Bone Palace, and I\u2019ve learned that King Bao was the one who took our treasure. He placed it inside Destiny\u2019s Tower. I cannot go in there, so I have had to come and ask you to fetch it for me.\u201d\n\nFox Queen looked very pitiable, and her sad expression would have been enough to make most people want to help her. Han Sen knew Fox Queen was much stronger than he was, but he still felt guilty. \u201cWhat is this treasure of the Foxes? Why would King Bao keep it inside Destiny\u2019s Tower?\u201d\n\nFox Queen hesitated, but ultimately said, \u201cThe treasure is called Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. It is a Fox-exclusive deified treasure. When a Fox becomes King class, they need the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror to be reborn nine times. Then they can become deified. After losing the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, not a single one of the Fox has been able to become deified. For a higher race, this is so sad. I hope you can understand our plight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in regards to why King Bao put the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror into Destiny\u2019s Tower, I have no idea. Normally, aside from the Fox, none can make use of the mirror.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned. He asked Fox Queen, who was in his arms, \u201cHow am I supposed to get the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror out of the tower?\u201d\n\nFox Queen blinked and said, \u201cI can use a Fox technique on you. Then, you will temporarily have the powers of a Fox. When you see the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, if it is not bound, you will not even have to move. It will just fly to you. Then, you can hide it on your person and carry it out unseen. It will not be difficult.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and said, \u201cIf that is true, then I can give this a shot. But I can only promise you that I will try. I cannot promise you that I will succeed.\u201d\n\nFox Queen immediately smiled. She lifted Han Sen\u2019s chin and kissed his cheek. She said, \u201cGood Little Brother. You\u2019re doing me a grand service, even if all you do is try. The whole Fox race will hold you in high regard. If you ever need anything, the Foxes and I will give you all the help you require.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sister. If I can really do this, I will help you because of the bond we share.\u201d Han Sen sounded as if he was in agreement, but inside, he was thinking something quite different.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to say any more of those cheesy phrases. Let\u2019s hurry. I will now place the Fox technique inside you. It will grant you Fox powers for a while.\u201d After that, Fox Queen sat up straight, wrapping her legs around Han Sen\u2019s waist. Then, she kissed him."
