Things didn\u2019t go awry as they had last time when they fought the Gold Armor General.\n\nHan Sen was holding his Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger tightly. He teleported behind Big Evil Beast. His time learning teleportation skills hadn\u2019t been wasted; he was able to appear next to Big Evil Beast in a moment.\n\nThe dagger was brimming with Han Sen\u2019s power when it cut through the enemy\u2019s wings. The powerful of Han Sen\u2019s strike ripped through the tissue of the wing all the way down its length. That was the creature\u2019s weakest spot. The rest of the monster\u2019s body was covered in scales, and not even with the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger could damage those locations.\n\nAfter he pierced through the wing, Han Sen saw a small part of the creature\u2019s back, next to where the wings used to be attached, that wasn\u2019t protected by scales. Han Sen stabbed the monster with the dagger, sending its power through the beast\u2019s flesh. The creature\u2019s flesh wasn\u2019t as tough as its scales were, but the flesh was still harder than that of an ordinary half-deified xenogeneic. Han Sen\u2019s dagger couldn\u2019t cut deep enough to reach the creature\u2019s heart.\n\nUpon feeling the strike, Big Evil Beast roared. Its aura of evil descended upon the system, cloaking everything around Han Sen and the others. When it flapped its wings, black feathers were fired everywhere like a hail of arrows.\n\nHan Sen stood before that hailstorm of feather arrows. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge them, and neither could he deflect them all. Judging by the radius of the attack, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to teleport to a safe distance.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t hesitate. He used his super god spirit body. The arrows passed harmlessly through him, and then Han Sen raced into Big Evil Beast\u2019s body. He reached the heart and stabbed it with his dagger.\n\nThe super god spirit body only lasted a second. After that, he was back to normal. Fortunately, in that time, Han Sen was able to rush into Big Evil Beast\u2019s heart and stab the organ repeatedly like a madman. Blood spilled everywhere. Big Evil Beast screamed, flapping around in circles like it was deranged. It was unable to do anything to Han Sen, who was in its heart.\n\nDragon One, Dia Robber, and the others watched as Big Evil Beast shrieked and spewed blood everywhere. Someone murmured, \u201cBrother Dollar really is one of the Very High! He is only King class, but he is already so strong. If he becomes half-deified, will he be able to fight a proper deified?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying about becoming half-deified? He is already fighting a deified,\u201d someone shot back.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing Brother Dollar, I know what a real champion looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch amazing power. It would be very hard for any race other than the Very High to do this. Not even the Extreme King has Kings on par with Dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018very hard\u2019? Feats like this are clearly impossible for anyone else.\u201d\n\nAs everyone was discussing this, they suddenly heard Big Evil Beast roar louder than before. Its scream was interrupted as its mouth filled with blood. Dragon One saw the creature cough out some chunks of flesh with the blood.\n\nDia Robber and the Destroyed were so happy. \u201cBrother Dollar is so strong! That Big Evil Beast must be dead.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Big Evil Beast\u2019s blood ran dry. Its movements slowed, and its lifeforce grew weak. The evil aura that had weighed on them all disappeared as the creature\u2019s substance chains dissipated one at a time.\n\nDragon One and Dia Robber moved forward to finish it off. They ran to attack the Big Evil Beast with all their strength, but they didn\u2019t have the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger, and so they couldn\u2019t deal any damage to the Big Evil Beast. Despite launching a frantic series of attacks, they couldn\u2019t penetrate Big Evil Beast\u2019s scales. They could only further damage its wings.\n\nBlergh!\n\nBig Evil Beast spilled more blood. Then, someone emerged from the bloody body. It was Han Sen, and he cut his way out, still clutching the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger.\n\nAfter Han Sen came out, the Big Evil Beast lost all control of its body. Its carcass floated in the system like a fish gone belly-up. Blood cloaked its form, and it twitched weakly from time to time.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic core deified hunted: Big Evil Beast. Deified xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. Again, there was no beast soul. \u201cIt looks like my luck has run out. Two deifieds and still no beast souls.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt like high-class xenogeneics had a lower drop rate than low-class xenogeneics. Han Sen couldn\u2019t be certain that was the case, but it was the way he was currently feeling.\n\n\u201cThank you for your assistance, Brother Dollar.\u201d Dia Robber was thrilled, and he thanked Han Sen profusely.\n\n\u201cYou are welcome, Brother Robber. It was a fair trade, and I didn\u2019t help you out of charity.\u201d Han Sen also returned the dagger to Dragon One.\n\n\u201cIs Brother Dollar still interested in hunting more xenogeneics?\u201d Dragon One asked as he accepted the dagger.\n\n\u201cI want to research the geno arts that I\u2019ve received recently. I don\u2019t plan on killing more xenogeneics right now. So, perhaps another time.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nDia Robber and Dragon One felt disappointed, but if Han Sen didn\u2019t want to go, then there was nothing they could do about that. They left the core area.\n\nHan Sen and Li Keer visited the nearby systems. They killed any xenogeneic Kings they saw. If they didn\u2019t find any, they kept traveling. Han Sen used most of his power to practice Li Keer\u2019s God\u2019s Wander and the Destroyed\u2019s Big Destroyed.\n\nHe practiced Big Destroyed for the longest time in that hope that Big Destroyed could help speed up his consumption of King class genes.\n\nLi Keer saw Han Sen practicing Big Destroyed and said, \u201cThat geno art was designed by the alpha of the Destroyed. It was created based on the unique design of their bodies. Light, dark, and chaos must be balanced within you. The geno art can\u2019t be practiced unless you have all three of those elements. Even among the Destroyed, only pure-blood Destroyed can practice it. Not many outsiders can learn it, that is for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just giving it a try,\u201d Han Sen said, unperturbed. He focused on using the Dongxuan Sutra to practice Big Destroyed.\n\nWhen Han Sen was in the sanctuaries, his body had evolved using all the elements. That included light, dark, and chaos elements. Plus, the Dongxuan Sutra itself enabled him to simulate geno arts. So, Han Sen was reasonably confident that he would be able to practice Big Destroyed. If he hadn\u2019t believed this, he wouldn\u2019t have risked fighting a deified xenogeneic to get his hands on the geno art.\n\nWhen Li Keer saw that Dollar continued to practice Big Destroyed despite her warning, she said nothing more. She just didn\u2019t think Han Sen would succeed.\n\nEven the Very High would have trouble learning Big Destroyed. The Very High Sense wouldn\u2019t be of much help. Even if Han Sen had a similar geno art, it wouldn\u2019t get him very far.\n\nBut Li Keer didn\u2019t know that Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra wasn\u2019t a creation of the Very High. Many parts of the geno art had been designed for entirely different purposes, and it was possible for him to do things that the Very High could not."
