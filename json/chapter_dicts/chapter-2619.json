    "text": "On the little jade island, Han Sen, Han Yan, and Bao\u2019er were sitting at a table with four gourds of various sizes laid out across it. They were the four gourds Han Yan had collected from the holy vine.\n\nThe three of them had briefly examined the gourds, but they still didn\u2019t know how to get the holy air out of them.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, can\u2019t you make these things release their holy air?\u201d Han Sen asked, glancing at Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er shook her head. \u201cI could if I was at the vine, but not right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean retrieving them was pointless, then?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed.\n\n\u201cStop trying. Once the holy gourds are separated from the holy vine, the holy air inside of them solidifies. They won\u2019t release anything.\u201d Yun Changkong smiled as he walked over to them. Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were following behind him.\n\n\u201cGreetings, brother,\u201d Han Yan said. She stood up and bowed to Yun Changkong.\n\n\u201cGreetings, auntie\u2026\u201d Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang bowed, as well.\n\n\u201cWhy is this so messed up?\u201d Han Sen thought. He bowed to Yun Changkong, too, but only referred to him as Elder Yun.\n\nThe Yun sisters said hi to him. They had been close for some time, so there was no need for a great deal of politeness.\n\nAfter Han Sen instructed them all to take a seat, he had Zero come and pour the tea. Yun Changkong had a sip and then said, \u201cThe holy gourds cannot release holy air now that they have been picked. But they are a material that can be used to forge deified treasures. We should conduct a test and learn what elements they are associated with. Then, I will have Sky Chance\u2019s department make the treasure for you. However, making the treasures will still require other materials, and they might be expensive. The process isn\u2019t guaranteed to be successful, either. I would wager it to be fifty-fifty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of materials will I be needing?\u201d Han Yan asked.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know that until we test the holy gourds. After we have decided what sort of treasure you want, then we can make a list of the materials that will be required.\u201d Yun Changkong smiled and went on to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, little sister. I will pay for the materials in return for your willingness to join us. Please do not object to my insistence. It is settled.\u201d\n\nUpon seeing Yun Changkong\u2019s certainty, Han Yan didn\u2019t turn down his offer.\n\nAfter chatting for a while, Yun Changkong turned to Han Sen. \u201cHan Sen, have you not been to the five cities?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Han Sen shook his head and said, \u201cI wanted to go to the five cities, but a guard told me I need some sort of special\n\npass.\u201d\n\nYun Changkong pulled out a piece of paper with a black symbol written on it. \u201cThe five cities are different from the twelve towers. It is very dangerous there, and the cities are all different from one another. Until you heal, you shouldn\u2019t go to the latter four. This is the Black King City spell of the five cities. If you have this, you will be allowed to enter the Black King City. Perhaps it can help you. But remember: you cannot lose the pass if you enter there. And you cannot kill anything inside. Otherwise, you will land in a lot of hot water.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is inside the Black King City?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. But you will find out as soon as you go there,\u201d Yun Changkong said, waving his hand with a mysterious air.\n\n\u201cThis spell can only allow one person inside?\u201d Han Sen asked with more curiosity.\n\nYun Changkong nodded and said, \u201cIn the future, little sister\u2019s spell will be handled by Sky Palace Leader. Her level is low now, so it is pointless for her to venture into the five cities. We will need to wait until she is King class. Then she will receive her five cities spell.\u201d\n\nAlthough Han Yan was now Yun Changkong\u2019s sister, she was still his student. Yun Changkong was explaining things to Han Yan just like an average instructor would.\n\nWith Yun Changkong only being the senior student, the atmosphere was so unnatural. The Yun sisters were very quiet because of it.\n\nYun Changkong understood why, though. He dropped the info and left, leaving Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang behind.\n\nWhen only the youngsters remained, the atmosphere became far more relaxed and comfortable. Amidst the liveliness, Han Sen was keen on asking the Yun sisters about the Black King City.\n\n\u201cFather said that our powers are too weak, and we cannot go in yet. That is why we don\u2019t know much about the cities. I have heard that Black King City is the safest of all the cities. As long as you keep the spell on your person, and you don\u2019t have any intent to kill within you, it shouldn\u2019t be too dangerous for you to go to the Black King City.\u201d Yun Suyi stopped to think for a moment, then said, \u201cThe legends claim that Black King City has many rare treasures in it. Many of the people that entered there came back with grand trophies, but they were never willing to say how they came into possession of them.\u201d\n\nThe Yun sisters didn\u2019t know much about the Black King City, which only made Han Sen even more curious.\n\nThe next day, he rode his legless crane to the White Jade Jing. He wanted to see the Black King City so he could see what was so special about it.\n\nOf course, when he reached the gate of the city, Han Sen was stopped by a Sky Palace student.\n\n\u201cMister Han, I\u2019m so sorry. Without a pass from the leader, no one is allowed to enter the Black King City.\u201d That guard had once attended lessons taught by Han Sen, so he was very polite.\n\n\u201cWill this do?\u201d Han Sen took out his pass and handed it over to the guard.\n\nThe student inspected it and then let him pass. Before Han Sen went, though, the guard reminded him that he must carry his spell at all times. He couldn\u2019t, at any cost, lose the spell.\n\nHan Sen thanked the guard and entered Black King City.\n\nFrom the outside, the city looked like an ancient place built from black jade. It looked old. It was mysterious and cold.\n\nAfter entering the Black King City, Han Sen was shocked by what he saw.\n\nHe had thought Black King City was a mysterious place, and that there might be dark and dangerous creatures out on the prowl. He at least thought it might look like the White Jade Tower, albeit with the presence of creatures.\n\nBut as Han Sen stepped on to the city\u2019s main street, he saw that the place was quite populated. It was a town with all sorts of people. There were merchants and farmers. There were even restaurants in which people relaxed and chatted as they ate.\n\nIf Han Sen hadn\u2019t come in through the clearly defined entrance, he\u2019d have assumed he had gone to the wrong place. This place shouldn\u2019t have been called Black King City. It was more like a small town on some underdeveloped planet.\u201cPeanuts! Walnuts! Pears! Dates!\u201d a seller was barking down the street.\n\nHan Sen could see a farmer leading a cow. There were chickens clucking in cages and dogs barking at one another on the street. Han Sen felt strangely unsettled as he walked down the street. When he was young, not even his home had been this underdeveloped. This was the sort of thing he might have seen in an old movie.\n\nHan Sen looked at the ancient city people around him and noted that they looked very human. They were almost exactly the same as his own people.\n\n\u201cHow is this possible? How can there be humans here?\u201d Han Sen mumbled to himself in shock.\n\nThey looked exactly like humans. They were different from the Very High, the Sky, and the Extreme King. They did not have the additional features that the other races had. They were practically identical to humans.\n\n\u201cAm I having some sort of hallucination? They cannot be humans,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nSoon after, though, he realized that what he was seeing couldn\u2019t just be some sort of illusion. The beings around him were obviously living humans.\n\nHan Sen wanted to use his Dongxuan Aura to examine them more closely, but he found that his power was all gone. Not a single speck of it remained."
