He wanted to test Glasses on his daughter Han Ling\u2019er and see how much potential she had. Soon after trying, though, he was forced to acknowledge that you could never tell how much potential a human had. It would always say the genes of a human were unstable and unable to be determined.\n\nThe creatures could have their potential and blood calculated, though. The results were promising, and some of them had a five-star gene potential.\n\nBecause they hadn\u2019t reached deified class, though, five stars were the highest their potentials could go. After becoming deified, their gene potentials could be tested again, and thus the tests at that time would be more accurate. It was like there was a distinction between those who were deified and those who weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo wonder the elites didn\u2019t want me before. Now it makes sense. Are the genes of humans really that unstable?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2026 hug hug\u2026\u201d Ling\u2019er was able to talk pretty well. She reached out her pale little hands as she ran to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMy little baby, let daddy kiss you.\u201d Han Sen lifted Ling\u2019er and kissed her on the cheeks.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t trapped, Han Sen came back every day to rest. He had been trapped inside the core area for many days, though, and so he hadn\u2019t seen his family.\n\nLing\u2019er was a good kid, and she didn\u2019t cry much. The family did a good job of protecting her, as well. After she was born, she hadn\u2019t used her super god spirit again. That came as a relief to Han Sen.\n\nSmall kids and too much power was a bad combination. Ling\u2019er hadn\u2019t yet learned how strong her powers were, and so she hadn\u2019t yet learned how to harness them. If her mood spiraled out of control, it would be a dangerous and frightening thing.\n\nLuckily, Ling\u2019er had a very calm personality, and the family was able to take care of her. So, nothing had gone wrong in his time away.\n\nHan Sen hoped Ling\u2019er would be able to grow up like an ordinary child. He wanted her to have a normal childhood. The last thing he wanted was for her to reach the complexities of adulthood too soon.\n\nHe rested at home for the night. The next day, he gathered a few cases of wine and took it to the core area. Now that the small Crocodile God had allowed him to leave, that meant it was likely he would be able to leave again in the future. Han Sen wasn\u2019t in a rush to get out of there, anyway. He wanted to spend more time digging and see what else there was to find in the fortress.\n\nHan Sen returned to the core area. When he arrived, the little Crocodile God ran frantically over to Han Sen. It roared at him repeatedly, its tone strange and wandering. Perhaps the crocodile was complaining about him being too slow.\n\n\u201cI was looking for that wine for you. I needed some time, as this stuff is very precious.\u201d Han Sen opened a barrel of wine, allowing the intoxicating fragrance to suffuse the area.\n\nThe small crocodile\u2019s eyes brightened. It stopped whining at Han Sen and jumped straight into the barrel of wine.\n\nHuge plumes of steam came from the wine barrel, and a second later, the wine was all dry. The small Crocodile God jumped out. Before Han Sen could open up the next barrel, the Crocodile God was already jumping inside.\n\nHan Sen soon realized that the Crocodile God didn\u2019t want to use the wine for drinking. The crocodile wanted to bathe in it.\n\n\u201cI have heard of women enjoying baths of milk, but I\u2019ve never heard of a crocodile wanting to bathe in wine.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but smile as he watched the enthusiastic little creature. The crocodile\u2019s scales were very hot, and although it had already tried to cool itself down, the wine was vaporized almost as soon as it entered the barrels. It was unable to take its time and swim around in the barrel\u2019s contents.\n\nIn no time at all, it went through a few barrels of wine. The small Crocodile God came out of the last barrel and roared softly at Han Sen. It seemed as if it wanted more. He wanted Han Sen to return and collect more wine for it.\n\n\u201cThis is a very rare treasure. It took me a while to gather these few barrels, so if you want more, you will have to wait a long time,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen had many barrels of wine in storage, and he could easily buy a few vineyards. He couldn\u2019t spoil the small Crocodile God, though. He had to plan for the long term.\n\nHan Sen brought two or three barrels for the crocodile each day. It was enough to keep the small creature happy, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep it satisfied.\n\nNow, Han Sen no longer had to work. The small crocodile wanted him to just bring it wine, but Han Sen still stuck to his cleaning duties. That was because he could dig wherever he wanted without the explicit command or direction of the little Crocodile God.\n\nEver since he found Glasses, Han Sen hadn\u2019t discovered anything useful. His lack of progress was frustrating. He worked in the fortress for a month, but he didn\u2019t find anything else of interest. His Jadeskin reached the ninth tier, so he couldn\u2019t level up anymore even if he continued to consume King xenogeneic genes.\n\nHan Sen then focused on his Blood-Pulse Sutra, leaving The Story of Genes as the last to be leveled up.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer were so depressed. They could see Han Sen coming and going as if the place was his own backyard. They wanted to leave, too, but no matter how much they tried talking to the two Crocodile Gods, they weren\u2019t permitted to go anywhere.\n\nThey tried to use the wine retrieval excuse, but the Crocodile God wasn\u2019t interested in what they had to offer. This made them incredibly sad.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know why the Crocodile Gods treated them differently, but everything was panning out perfectly for him. Han Sen actually thought it was convenient that the two of them were still trapped. If they got free, they might cause him problems of some sort.\n\n\u201cThe Very High are nothing that special. They can\u2019t even deal with a transmutation deified. They are worse than the Ancient God,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nActually, Han Sen only thought this because he hadn\u2019t learned the nature of their strength. The power of the Very High didn\u2019t lie purely in their combat abilities, and they had nearly limitless resources. If the Very High survived long enough, they could become butterflies with ease. That was better than most races.\n\nSince he still wasn\u2019t managing to dig up any worthwhile items, all Han Sen achieved was making the small Crocodile God an alcoholic. Han Sen kept giving it wine, but the creature never drank it. It used every barrel for bathing. It sickened Han Sen to see so much fine wine be wasted. No matter how rich he was, it hurt to see something so precious be poured down the drain.\n\nHan Sen examined and excavated the whole fortress, but he didn\u2019t find anything useful. He hadn\u2019t even been able to find the body that the arm had been attached to. It seemed as if only the arm had been left behind.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I need to find a way out of here.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t interested in delivering wine to the Crocodile Gods for the rest of eternity.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, didn\u2019t you say that your elders would come and save you? When are they going to come?\u201d Han Sen found a chance to stop by and talk to Exquisite and Li Keer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It could take two or three months, or it could take a couple of years,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cWhy would it take them so long?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nExquisite didn\u2019t answer Han Sen\u2019s question. Actually, the Very High had self-spells coded into their bodies. If they were in danger or injured, the self-spell would awaken. If they died, the self-spell would self-destruct, and people were sure to know something had happened to them.\n\nBut Exquisite and Li Keer were neither injured nor in danger. The self-spell wasn\u2019t going to ring its alarm. If the Very High people didn\u2019t hear anything from the self-spell, they\u2019d have no clue that something had happened to the two women.\n\nAfter a while, if Exquisite remained missing, the people of her race would notice her absence. They knew where she had gone, but it was hard to determine when they would notice her absence.\n\nWhile the two women were wallowing in their depression, Han Sen set out a grilled goose to munch on. He ate it and drank, picking through a side of fruit as well. They wanted to eat some, too."
