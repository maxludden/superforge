    "text": "\u201cHan Sen, you can still turn back from this,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said gravely.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t answer, though. Instead, he kept thinking.\n\nIce Blue Knight King had no personal vendetta against Han Sen. Actually, considering their mutual connection with Yisha, Ice Blue Knight King shouldn\u2019t have been hostile towards him at all. And on top of that, Bai Wei was supposed to be taking Han Sen to the Extreme King very soon. There was no reason for Ice Blue Knight King to attack him now. This was going against the will of the Extreme King\u2019s ruler, and thus, it could be considered a most grievous crime.\n\nAs he thought about it, Han Sen could only pin it on the stone tablet that was in his possession. Edward had even used the Ancient God statuette to try to get his hands on the stone tablet.\n\n\u201cIf Ice Blue Knight King knew about the stone tablet, he would have attacked me already. Why would he have waited until this very moment? He must have just learned about this, and only Edward knows that I took the stone tablet. But if that is the case, what would prompt Edward to suddenly tell Ice Blue Knight King that I have the stone tablet?\u201d Han Sen thought, racing to figure it out. \u201cRight, it has to be because Bai Wei now wants to take me away. Edward must know that there is nothing he can do to stop me. Telling Ice Blue Knight King would have been his last resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like this stone tablet is worth more than I thought. Even Ice Blue Knight King is willing to go against the king\u2019s decree by trying to keep me here. If they are that desperate to get me to stay, perhaps the stone tablet only works here. Otherwise, they could think of a way to get it back once I\u2019m with the Extreme King. They would have to be incredibly motivated to go against their own ruler\u2019s commands with such a reckless plan.\u201d\n\nHan Sen raised his head to look at Ice Blue Knight King high in the sky. He could have already killed Han Sen had he wanted to. With the man\u2019s power and reputation, he probably could\u2019ve murdered Han Sen and gotten away with it.\n\nPerhaps he had stayed his hand because of his memory of Yisha. Maybe he didn\u2019t actually want to hurt Han Sen, and all he wanted was that tablet.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t want to give up the tablet, so there was a conflict of interest. If Han Sen handed the tablet over, Ice Blue Knight King would stop coming after Han Sen. Whatever the case might be, it didn\u2019t seem as if he\u2019d stop unless he got the tablet, and he would get it no matter what.\n\n\u201cD*mn it! How did Edward know I took the stone tablet? They shouldn\u2019t have any way of knowing what the stone tablet does. How did he find out after I took it?\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nHe had been so careful, but Edward still discovered the theft.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have time to think it over, though. If Han Sen wasn\u2019t willing to let go of the stone tablet, then he had to find a way to escape.\n\nThey were currently in the headquarters of the Ice Blue Knights, so Han Sen was surrounded by elites on all sides. Ice Blue Knight King didn\u2019t want to cause a big scene, and he didn\u2019t want to push Han Sen to the edge. So, he had come for him alone.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, that thing is useless for you. Leave it, and you can still receive a reward.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King hadn\u2019t actually attacked yet; he was only using his strength to suppress Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Han Sen used his knifemind and swordmind to blast away Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s powerful aura. As soon as he struck back against the aura, the pressure released him.\n\nHis knife and swordmind were half-deified, and so they were just as good as Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s. But there was such a difference in physical power between the two that there was no chance of any real competition between them.\n\n\u201cIf you insist on this course, then I will have to take you back myself.\u201d Upon seeing Han Sen\u2019s knifemind and swordmind, Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s eyes glowed with admiration.\n\nIt was very rare to see a Marquise Extreme King who had refined their minds to such heights.\n\nA glowing blue light had covered Ice Blue Knight King since he forced his way into Han Sen\u2019s rooms. It was only a passive effect, but the longer it ran, the wider the glow became. It looked as if the air itself was becoming blue. It surrounded Han Sen, and he felt a chilling energy radiating from it. He felt as if that aura was going to freeze him.\n\nThe cold power would limit Han Sen\u2019s ability to fight back. Attempting to teleport would be useless inside of that blue light. Break Space Flash only let Han Sen teleport short distances, so he couldn\u2019t escape that radius.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er were freezing inside that blue light. The two looked like a pair of frozen ice cubes floating in the blue.\n\nInside the base, Edward watched the events unfold with a satisfied smile. \u201cIce Blue Knight King isn\u2019t a particularly talented member of the Extreme King, but he has faith in principles that others have forgotten. He is the only one who has brought the Ice Blue geno art up to that level. It\u2019s a basic skill that people rarely spend any time on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis attempts to rise are useless, though. Even from birth, we knew that he would never become deified. He will be half-deified no matter what.\u201d The Ice Blue Knight next to Edward smiled. His gaze then moved over to Han Sen. \u201cI am curious about this Han Sen, though. He has an amazing shield treasure, but he also managed to kill Night River King. That isn\u2019t something he could accomplish simply by having a good defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you seen the little girl with the Jade Drum? That isn\u2019t an average Jade Drum. It is a mutant King class Jade Drum, and it has a sonic attack power. I inspected Night River King\u2019s body. Although he was killed by being decapitated, his brain had already suffered tremendous damage. He must not have blocked the Jade Drum\u2019s attack,\u201d Edward said quietly.\n\n\u201cHe is just a Marquise of some small race. He has so many treasures that you and I want so badly, though.\u201d The Ice Blue Knight looked at Bao\u2019er\u2019s Jade Drum with greed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to this guy than it seems. We didn\u2019t even know the exact nature of the relic, but he was able to find it. If not for him, we would never have noticed that the relic was just a small stone plate that was fixed to the roof. It has a ridiculous amount of power.\u201d Edward narrowed his eyes as he looked at Han Sen. \u201cIf possible, I would very much like to avoid making an enemy of him. But we need that relic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think Han Sen will manage to escape? If we bring him down here, no one will guess that a mere stone plate is the relic that we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019ll have a perfect opportunity to grab it from among his things. Then again, if he escapes, that will present other opportunities.\u201d The Ice Blue Knight looked at Edward.\n\n\u201cI think Ice Blue Knight King can stop him. But even if Han Sen pulls another rabbit out of his hat to get past the Knight King, I will ensure that things go our way.\u201d Edward looked confident. \u201cIce Blue Knight King can help us by explaining things to King Bai. We just need to wait, and we\u2019ll soon have our hands on the item.\u201d\n\nIn another part of the base, Mister White and Crime were also watching what was going on. Mister White frowned, but he remained speechless. Crime asked with much curiosity, \u201cMister White, what is going on? Why is Ice Blue Knight King attacking Han Sen?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing on this planet that could make Ice Blue Knight King disobey orders and attack Han Sen.\u201d Mister White looked at Han Sen with a strange expression.\n\n\u201cNo way; why would he have that?\u201d Crime\u2019s eyes opened wide in disbelief."
