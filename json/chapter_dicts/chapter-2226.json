    "text": "\u201cWhat is the level of this Undying Bird?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown. The name of the beast didn\u2019t sound like one that would bode well.\n\n\u201cDeified.\u201d Bai Wei did not hesitate to give him an answer.\n\nHan Sen licked his lips, looked at her, and said, \u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re talking about? You\u2019re on the hunt for a deified xenogeneic? Doing something like that will get you killed. Even a guy like me will get killed going up against a foe like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are afraid, you do not have to go.\u201d Bai Wei changed her course and started flying toward a river that went beneath a cliff.\n\n\u201cIs this woman stupid?\u201d Han Sen had to bring his team and follow her. But Han Sen did not think she was flat-out stupid. He was certain she wouldn\u2019t be so willing to throw her life away in a pursuit like this.\n\nIt was Bai Wei\u2019s first time in Lava Valley, but she knew about the Undying Bird. That at least meant she had come prepared. Her punishment of being sent to Planet Ice Blue probably had something to do with the Undying Bird.\n\nSo Han Sen quickly followed. Han Sen wanted to know what Bai Wei was up to. Otherwise, he\u2019d just tie her up and drag her along with him.\n\nBai Wei looked as if she were familiar with the location, and after she got close to the lava river, she flew in a following of its way. She went toward a cave that had lava flowing out of it and flew right into it.\n\nHan Sen and his companions entered the cave, too. The entire cave was filled up with lava, so they had to fly over it.\n\n\u201cEven if you are this intent on going, you should at least explain what this endeavor is all about.\u201d Han Sen, as he followed Bai Wei, resumed conversation.\n\nBai Wei just ignored him. She continued flying the way she wished to. The cave didn\u2019t have any other fire xenogeneics occupying it. Strangely, it was entirely clear. Aside from the burning hot lava, there was nothing else there.\n\nBai Wei was quiet, and she flew in a course that took them over half a day. All of a sudden, however, an explosion sounded. Han Sen looked in the direction of the chaotic acoustics, and he saw a cave open up. It was like a giant underworld had presented itself. The lava moved to drop down a cliff that was ahead of them. It became a lava waterfall, and it looked very strange.\n\nAfter they flew out of the cave, they saw that the underworld was gold and red. Lava was everywhere. It was like a sea of lava. Across the large sea of lava was a black mountain. There were lots of green plants growing across it, and it looked rather amazing to behold.\n\nBai Wei flew toward the island across the lava sea without hesitation, but now she was flying at a much slower pace. It was evident that she was worried about something.\n\nHan Sen let Ji Qing, Han Yan, and Huangfu Jing sit atop Little Star\u2019s back. Little Star was able to lead. If there were danger, and the Bai Sema was unable to be used, Little Star\u2019s power would be sufficient in saving their lives.\n\nWahlaa!\n\nSomewhere on that lava sea, an explosion occurred. The lava was tossed about like a spring bursting out of the ground. Something black and red emerged, and it was headed straight for Bai Wei.\n\nBai Wei\u2019s face did not change, and she threw a punch at the black and red shadow. There was another explosion as the lava on its body spread out. She punched it and had the creature falling back ten meters down into the lava.\n\nHan Sen, upon a clearer look, noticed how the monster resembled a crocodile. Its body was black like charcoal, but some parts of it were red like the lava.\n\nHan Sen looked around, and he saw many more of the charcoal-like shadows. They were like burnt wood, and many of them were coming forward to amass there.\n\nWahlaa! Wahlaa!\n\nMany three-meter long crocodiles emerged from the lava. They were all headed for Bai Wei and Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen summoned his Spell pistols. He fired bullets at the lava crocodiles while Han Meng\u2019er fired her black arrows at the same fiends.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang! Pang!\n\nMany of the lava crocodiles were killed by the bullets and black arrows. Their lava-looking bodies shattered into bits and scattered all around. They were like clumps of lava disintegrating back into the sea of lava. But Han Sen did not hear a hunting accomplished announcement. The broken crocodiles fell into the lava and became perfect again, and then they resumed their assault.\n\nBai Wei kept killing the lava crocodiles as she made her way to the island. She did not plan on stopping, and it was clear that she knew the crocodiles were unable to be killed.\n\nHan Sen saw what she was doing, so he stopped killing the lava crocodiles. He allowed Han Meng\u2019er to summon her blue Demon Bug King Bai Sema. It was able to protect everyone, so they all headed for the island in haste.\n\nBai Wei was sprinting forward when she suddenly saw the shield of Han Sen\u2019s people appear right next to her. The lava crocodiles were launching themselves against the shield, and as that happened, they simply hit the surface and fell away.\n\nHan Sen was not planning on protecting her with the shield, though. He followed Bai Wei and watched her kill lava crocodiles alone.\n\nBai Wei was a little bit mad about this, but she did not say anything. She kept moving toward the island and punched the lava crocodiles that got in her way. The lava crocodiles were difficult to kill, but they were not strong. They were just ordinary Marquises, and so they couldn\u2019t prohibit Bai Wei from advancing.\n\nNot long later, Bai Wei found herself on the shore of the island. When she arrived, she started sinking. Han Sen felt the same thing happening to him, too. He felt so heavy, and it was like he was back on Earth after a flight through space and the reintroduction of gravity. They all started falling down onto the stone of the island.\n\n\u201cThis island forbids air powers?\u201d Ji Qing looked at the island in surprise as she spoke.\n\nBai Wei said coldly, \u201cIt does not only stop the air. It is easy to come, but getting out is far harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen looked at Bai Wei and asked.\n\nBai Wei did not answer. She pointed to the lava sea that was offshore of the island.\n\nHan Sen turned around. Across the sea in the burning lava were some gold bugs. They looked like high-temperature lava, but they were in fact bugs. God only knew how many of them there were.\n\n\u201cThese are lava bugs, and they cannot leave the lava. They are extremely aggressive, and not even Dukes can withstand their temperatures. They can fly here, but because you cannot do the same, you have to run across the lava if you ever seek to leave. You need to be a mile away from the place to fly, and going out there can kill you. I hope your shield is enough to break the lava bugs\u2019 attacks, otherwise you are all going to die,\u201d Bai Wei said coldly. She was not happy that Han Sen hadn\u2019t protected her in the shield."
