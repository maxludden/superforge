    "text": "Lando opened his eyes and instantly froze. The person who had grabbed him was Han Sen, the same person that he had just hurled out of the area. \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came back to ask you why you would save me,\u201d Han Sen said casually.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t afraid of evil, but he was afraid of kindness. If someone took advantage of him, he\u2019d always pay them back threefold. But if he owed someone a favor, he never knew quite how to return it.\n\nWhile Han Sen was fleeing the area, he suddenly realized something. The invisible shield that confined them had been broken, but the scary deified who had placed the shield was still around somewhere. If Han Sen couldn\u2019t sort out that little problem, escaping might be impossible whether the invisible wall was there or not. The hostile deified probably wouldn\u2019t let them go.\n\n\u201cSave you? I\u2019m not nice enough to do that. I just didn\u2019t want my prize to get stolen,\u201d Lando said, rolling his eyes.\n\nLando\u2019s body was riddled with injuries, but despite that, he didn\u2019t feel pain. He didn\u2019t feel anything. He just looked pale.\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d Han Sen nodded. He hadn\u2019t really thought that Lando was saving him just to be magnanimous. This answer made sense.\n\nWhile they were talking, the Tianxia Unicorn had turned to head toward them again. It knew Lando was dying, as well. It flew over to them, but it didn\u2019t finish Lando off. The creature wanted to revel in its victory.\n\n\u201cHow about we make a deal?\u201d Han Sen suggested, looking at Lando.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying. What sort of deal could we possibly strike?\u201d Lando asked wryly.\n\n\u201cIf we kill this unicorn together, how about we both live?\u201d Han Sen said, pointing at the Tianxia Unicorn.\n\n\u201cWe can live. At least for a while,\u201d Lando replied emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cThen you and I can kill it together. If we succeed, will you let me go?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Lando.\n\nHearing Han Sen\u2019s question, Dragon One raised an eyebrow in scorn. \u201cIs this guy insane? How can he say something so ridiculous at a time like this?\u201d\n\nEveryone who heard Han Sen\u2019s words shared Dragon One\u2019s opinion. Lando was heavily injured and on the precipice of death. Although Han Sen wasn\u2019t injured, he was just a second-tier King. He was far from being deified. Two people like them working together to slay a deified was like two ants teaming up to take down an elephant.\n\n\u201cHas the shock of battle ruined Han Sen\u2019s mind? He actually thinks they can kill the Tianxia Unicorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so pathetic. It proves that any person can become delusional if they\u2019re desperate enough. This is no different than seeing the mirage of an oasis while crawling through a desert with no water, about to die of thirst.\u201d\n\nMany elites sighed. Seeing the desperation of the two young elites was saddening. Some of the viewers even sympathized with them.\n\nUnless they became deified, they wouldn\u2019t control their own fates. All the elite Kings and half-deifieds felt a pang of empathy in their hearts as they looked at Han Sen and Lando.\n\nWhat was happening to Han Sen and Lando today could end up happening to them tomorrow. There was no guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t encounter a cruel deified being by chance.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Lando answered simply. He just nodded and looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis is so pathetic! Lando was invincible against others of the same level. He is the man who slew his master. And now he has fallen this far, to put stock in such a ridiculous hope?\u201d Dragon One, seeing all this, looked full of hatred and disdain.\n\nKlose frowned, too. He didn\u2019t know much about Lando. Although Lando joined the Destroyed, he was a very solitary individual by nature. Plus, he wasn\u2019t really one of the Destroyed. They didn\u2019t have much inclination to associate with the disgraced Dragon.\n\nBut even if he didn\u2019t understand Lando well, he knew that anyone who could slay a deified must possess a considerable amount of mental fortitude. Lando\u2019s mental health shouldn\u2019t have deteriorated like so, even under that sort of pressure.\n\nBut Lando seemed to accept Han Sen\u2019s ludicrous suggestion. Clearly, the strain had gotten to the man. That was why he put hope in something so silly.\n\n\u201cDeath is a very interesting thing. No matter how strong a person might be, they will always appear small at the hands of death.\u201d Klose sighed.\n\nHe was the same, too. Even though he was a deified, he would still fight to live for the sake of living.\n\n\u201cThen we have a deal,\u201d Han Sen said, his face completely serious.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Lando asked Han Sen with a curious look.\n\nLando didn\u2019t actually believe Han Sen could do what he had suggested. Lando was just curious about what Han Sen was planning.\n\nIn fact, Lando had always been curious about Han Sen. Han Sen was like his complete opposite.\n\nLando\u2019s life had never given him many good memories to look back on. He stayed alive more out of habit than anything.\n\nHan Sen was different. Han Sen was a man who possessed a fierce desire to live. Han Sen would employ any method necessary, including betraying his promise by trying to escape Lando, in order to survive.\n\nBut the moment that Han Sen came back to save him, Lando began to wonder just who Han Sen really was. Somewhere in his heart, Lando had the suspicion that he had misjudged Han Sen in some fundamental way.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t answer Lando. He wasn\u2019t looking at the Tianxia Unicorn, though, which was hovering over them like some victorious warrior.\n\nHan Sen helped Lando get back to his feet. He reached out his hand and placed it down on Lando\u2019s forehead. He looked like a priest that was about to bless his congregation.\n\nHan Sen calmly looked at Lando. In a very calm voice, he slowly said, \u201cI\u2026 Han Sen\u2026 by the name of all the gods\u2026 grant you\u2026 Lando\u2026 holy power forever\u2026 open the door of destiny\u2026\u201d\n\nHearing what Han Sen had just said, Dragon One and Klose almost spat out the tea in their mouths.\n\nThe Dukes and the nobles that watched the stream stared at their screens. They looked at Han Sen as if they were watching someone retarded.\n\nAt that moment, Han Sen\u2019s actions were no longer ridiculous. Now they were simply idiotic. The approach of death must have made him lose his mind.\n\nEven if they sympathized with Han Sen earlier, this was too much.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy! By the name of all the gods? Han Sen must have gone insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so funny. I think I overestimated him. He was someone impressive before, but I cannot believe his will is this weak. He has clearly gone crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! By the name of all the gods\u2026 This is so funny\u2026 This is the funniest joke I have ever heard!\u201d Dragon One laughed so much that tears were welling up in his eyes.\n\nAfter hearing what Han Sen said, even the Tianxia Unicorn looked amused. Mirth crossed over its horse-like face, and it whinnied in a way that sounded a lot like a human chuckle.\n\nSo many elites populated the geno universe. Even if they were deified elites, they wouldn\u2019t call upon the gods for aid. Using the names of the gods for help was something no one would do, not even Sacred Leader in his time of power.\n\nBut Han Sen, as a second-tier King, had dared to call on the gods. It made everyone think this was all a comedy."
