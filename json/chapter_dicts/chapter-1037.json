There were countless branching pathways, each guided by thick walls that were around one meter tall. It was in this wall-breaking way that they proceeded.\n\nAlu-Alu!\n\nAnother wall was smashed through. Beyond it, something new greeted their eyes. It was another palace, just smaller in size than the previous one. It did, however, have a pool at its center and a tree in the middle of that.\n\nThe tree was strange. It was two meters tall and it only had two leaves to its name.\n\nBetween the leaves was a sole grey fruit. It was hefty-looking\u2014around the same size as a football\u2014but it looked slimy and sickly.\n\n\u201cHoly-Jade Fruit.\u201d Xie Qing King looked at the fruit with much excitement. He reached out and tried to grab it.\n\nBut before he could, the fruit broke. From within its sticky interior, a juice oozed out.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s face suddenly became ghastly, and so he punched the fruit away.\n\nThe ooze of the fruit splashed across the tiled copper floor, and after a moment\u2019s rest, started to violently corrode the copper surface.\n\nHan Sen was well-aware how solid that copper was, so it was frightening to see the potency of that juice. If it touched a human, Han Sen couldn\u2019t imagine the pain that would befall its victim.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s hand suffered a couple drops of that corrosive liquid, and it had damaged his hand a good deal; it gushed blood.\n\nThe juice was no joke, if it had also managed to pierce and ravage his hand while it was still ablaze with the powerful silver light.\n\nAll Han Sen could think was how thankful he was, to have decided to hang several meters behind Xie Qing King. If he was any closer, he could very well have been sprayed by that horrendous fluid.\n\n\u201cKing-Corpse Juice; that d*mned turkey. It is only fortunate I have trained in the ways of combatting evil. A splash of this stuff is all it takes to fell even the most powerful spirit.\u201d After explaining, Xie Qing King punched the tree and snapped it in two.\n\nWhen it broke, a grey mist seeped from the two broken ends. Suddenly, he was petrified and rendered unable to move.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, seeing another trap immediately spring out to get Xie Qing King.\n\nPhoenix Emperor must have known what sort of person he was. Ordinary people wouldn\u2019t have punched the tree right after a spoiled harvest, but Xie Qing King did. Knowing he\u2019d react this way, Phoenix Emperor had constructed another surprise trap for when he did.\n\nThe King-Corpse Juice was merely a red herring, and it wasn\u2019t actually the planned way to stop Xie Qing King. It was not half as efficient as a substance that could petrify. Han Sen had no clue what it was, but it had worked without fault. In an instant, a king spirit was wholly petrified.\n\nAs Han Sen inched forward to inspect the tree, Xie Qing King started to shout. \u201cHe put Stone-Jade Miasma inside the tree. Pah! Weak. He\u2019ll need to do better than that to petrify me. I\u2019m going to dig his corpse up!\u201d\n\nXie Qing King had managed to regain control of his eyes and mouth, but his body was still frozen stiff.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking at? Are you going to help me or what?!\u201d Xie Qing King yelled.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Han Sen asked him. It was no wonder Phoenix Emperor imprisoned him down there.\n\nIf he had known about him being locked up, Han Sen would not have helped him out. The spirit may not have been hostile, but he was not the same species and could not 100% be trusted.\n\nXie Qing King responded, \u201cThat sneak knew I\u2019d use my Evil-Breaker Power to smash that tree containing the Stone-Jade Miasma. I have been petrified, yes, but only my exterior has been. Break the stones that encompass me and I will be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am so weak,\u201d Han Sen pretended.\n\nXie Qing King said, \u201cBut you have to try. Typically, only his Undying Flame can break these stones, but it\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Xie Qing King and thought him to be strangely naive. He wondered why the spirit was so sure Han Sen would both be willing and able to save him from his entrapment.\n\nHan Sen then recalled the time he had spent in the spirit base, and how lower-tier spirits would blindly follow one who was superior and provide them spirit geno points.\n\nA real spirit would attempt to save Xie Qing King, no matter what it took.\n\nBut Han Sen was just a human, and he felt no obligation to save or truly follow a spirit who may have been superior to him.\n\n\u201cHurry! The stone is starting to settle inside my flesh, strengthening. If we co-operate, perhaps the combination of our powers will be enough to break this curse,\u201d Xie Qing King pleaded.\n\nHan Sen wondered whether or not he should reveal who he truly was. But just as he considered doing so, he heard a wall on the side of that chamber begin to rise.\n\n\u201cSomeone is here!\u201d Han Sen looked around, checking to see if there was someplace he could hide.\n\nXie Qing King noticed this, as well, and so he stopped talking.\n\nHan Sen saw two men standing behind that risen wall. It was a human and a spirit, and they were both visibly surprised to see Han Sen there. They had obviously entered expecting the place to be empty and free of others.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the spirit asked, staring at Han Sen. His power looked crushing, as if he could squish him like a bug.\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \u201cThis must be Holy-Sword Emperor. The human next to him must be Brother Seven.\u201d"
