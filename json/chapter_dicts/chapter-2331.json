    "text": "\u201cMaster, Bai Yi has entered the Pavilion,\u201d Cher said with a bow to Bai Ling Shuang.\n\nBai Ling Shuang was seated on a sofa. Her beautiful legs were up, and she was holding a wine glass that she slowly twirled. Her expression changed to disdain, and she said, \u201cNow that Bai Wuchang has used his pass, the Pavilion only has the statues of the alpha, the second king, and King Bao. The alpha and the second king\u2019s statues have been there for billions of years, as no one has been able to understand them. And as for that King Bao, he was a strange king. Many royal children have tried to understand his statue, but they left empty-handed. There is no way Bai Yi will be able to understand anything about the statue.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of asking for a reward that he could use more easily, Bai Yi insisted that he be given a Pavilion Pass. He does think a little too highly of himself,\u201d Cher said.\n\nBai Ling Shuang\u2019s lips tasted the wine. Then, she set the glass down. \u201cIn this world, the hardest thing isn\u2019t understanding the enemy; it\u2019s understanding yourself. Bai Yi isn\u2019t the only person who struggles with that. Even with all the elites in our race, how many of them can truly claim to understand themselves? Bai Yi is just an ordinary man. It isn\u2019t surprising that he asked for something beyond his capabilities. He won\u2019t learn his limitations until he has tried it for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct, master. After all, there are not many people in this universe who are as insightful as you,\u201d Cher gushed.\n\nBai Ling Shang looked at Cher and coldly said, \u201cYour Fox tricks do not work on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Cher said immediately.\n\nBai Ling Shuang waved her hand, and she was about to respond when a look of shock crossed her face. She went to the balcony and looked up into the sky.\n\nFrom another planet, a beam of light was shooting across the universe, casting shadows across entire planets.\n\n\u201cThe Pavilion\u2026 That is impossible!\u201d Bai Ling Shuang stared at the light in utter disbelief.\n\nEvery person of the Extreme King was in shock as they turned their heads up toward the beam of light coursing through the skies.\n\nThat light seemed born from powerful magic. As people looked at it, it seemed less like a king than a god or a devil. The scary presence was felt all over King\u2019s Kingdom.\n\nUnder the gaze of all those royals in King\u2019s Kingdom, the light moved. It started punching. It was the Extreme King\u2019s most basic skill: Extreme King Punch.\n\nThe Extreme King\u2019s geno arts were all derived from the Extreme King Punch. Even Bai Wei\u2019s Extreme King Final Punch was an improved version of Extreme King Punch.\n\nBut this basic example of Extreme King Punch was shown through a shadow. It was hard to imagine how scary it was. Every punch seemed to hold enough power to break the universe.\n\nAs the nobles watched those punches, their hearts leaped in their chests. They were suppressed, and they found it difficult to breathe. It felt as if every punch they saw was going to cripple the whole universe, crushing them in the process.\n\nJust watching that power coming from the punches was enough to put everyone in a daze. Those with weak wills found blood trickling from their noses and ears.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 our alpha\u2026 is it\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cHas someone claimed the alpha statue?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2026 who is this\u2026?\u201d\n\nAlmost everyone was wondering, especially the royal children. Even the nearby nobles were shocked.\n\nIt had been billions of years, and in all that time, no one had been able to claim it. The opening of that statue would shake the very foundation of their society.\n\nNo matter which prince or princess claimed the alpha statue, this was going to draw King Bai\u2019s attention. If the royal child was already known to be incredibly talented, then this might be enough for them to usurp the place of the current crown prince.\n\nAfter all, the crown prince wasn\u2019t really very famous. The current crown prince had been selected only because he was the eldest son of the king. King Bai could boot that crown prince off his pedestal whenever he wanted to.\n\nBai Wei watched the alpha\u2019s shadow of Extreme King Punch. She seemed to learn something as she stared. She followed what she saw in the sky and started to move, punch after punch. Her punches started off very complicated, but they became very simple. Her final punch became the most basic Shocking Sky Punch.\n\nBut her body was becoming stronger. It was becoming closer with the shadow of their alpha.\n\nKatcha!\n\nSome sort of lock inside Bai Wei appeared to have been broken. Her original body became an astral body, but the development didn\u2019t end there. Following the alpha\u2019s shadow punch, Bai Wei\u2019s body continued to increase. She was fast going to have a celestial body.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just happening to Bai Wei, either. The whole of the Extreme King\u2014every single person that practiced Shocking Sky Punch or something similar to it\u2014began to gain strength because of that shadow. Many elites broke their boundaries, and even King class and deified sorts gained more power.\n\n\u201cSo this is the power of our legendary alpha\u2026 He is so holy\u2026 Who did this? Who is the one that claimed the alpha statue?\u201d Everyone was both shocked and exuberantly delighted by this turn of events, and they discussed rabidly between themselves.\n\nThe most likely candidate, they presumed, was Bai Wuchang. But he had already claimed a statue for himself. There was no way he would be allowed to go back to the Pavilion to grab another, so it couldn\u2019t be him.\n\nOthers of royalty were powerful, too. No one could guess who it might have been.\n\nOnly Bai Ling Shuang\u2019s expression was conflicted. She knew Bai Yi was in the Pavilion at that moment, but she was unable to fathom how Bai Yi, of all people, could have opened the alpha statue.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be Bai Yi. There is probably some other royal child inside the Pavilion.\u201d Bai Ling Shuang gritted her teeth as she spoke.\n\nThe light that came from the Pavilion began to fade, taking the alpha shadow with it. Many nobles and Extreme King elites looked towards the Pavilion. They wanted to know who had claimed the alpha statue.\n\nKing Bai was inside the palace, playing a game of chess. He held one of the pieces in his hand, forgotten, as he stared toward the Pavilion.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, my king, on having such a good son.\u201d The person who was playing with King Bai smiled.\n\n\u201cTeacher, which prince do you think it is?\u201d King Bai asked levelly, putting down a white chess piece.\n\nIt was the Extreme King\u2019s National Teacher, known as Ancient Abyss, who was playing chess with him. The teacher looked like a forty-year-old man. He looked quite handsome with his little beard, but it did make him look older. Despite that, he looked quite dreamy and light.\n\nAncient Abyss bowed and said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d\n\nKing Bai didn\u2019t ask any more questions. He looked in the direction of the Pavilion, waiting for the prince or princess that claimed the alpha king to emerge.\n\nHan Sen, in the Extreme King\u2019s Pavilion, was shocked. He\u2019d only wanted a small reward for his efforts with the statue. He hadn\u2019t intended to draw much attention, and now he frowned worriedly.\n\nIf he really was Bai Yi, he\u2019d have been overjoyed. But he was only masquerading as Bai Yi, and now that he had caused so much of a disturbance, everyone was sure to turn their focus on him. His chances of being exposed were now incredibly high.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done, so there\u2019s no point in worrying about it now. I\u2019ll just take the item for now.\u201d Han Sen looked at the space within the alpha statue. The opening had been revealed."
