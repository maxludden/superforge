    "text": "Han Sen didn\u2019t answer. He spread his Eternity solidifying powers all over himself. His body became solid and unchangeable, halting Bai Yi\u2019s invasion in its tracks. It solidified Bai Yi\u2019s Original Water King Body as well. It couldn\u2019t invade Han Sen\u2019s cells any further, and it couldn\u2019t retreat either.\n\nBut Eternity\u2019s solidifying properties could only lock things down as they were. It was unable to erase the Original Water King Body that had already established its encroaching presence.\n\n\u201cBai Yi, you better answer my question. Otherwise, don\u2019t take it out on me for being cruel to you.\u201d Han Sen rose out of the lava valley and found a hidden place where he could speak to Bai Yi.\n\n\u201cYou cannot scare me,\u201d Bai Yi hissed back. \u201cAlthough your power might have stopped the process of Return to Origin, your own body has been paused, too. You can\u2019t remain like this forever, and you can\u2019t do anything about my presence here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you really Prince Sixteen?\u201d Han Sen asked curiously, ignoring what Bai Yi had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. Ask around if you want, and you will learn much of my famous name.\u201d Bai Yi sounded cocky.\n\n\u201cYou are a prince, so what are you doing in Knight\u2019s Paradise? And why are you fighting to claim a Metal Doll?\u201d Han Sen asked, knowing that something odd had to be going on.Read more new novels on\n\nKnight\u2019s Paradise was a place that was set up for the Royal Guards. Ordinary royal children would never go there. And it seemed rather absurd for a prince to fight Han Sen over the ownership of a Duke Metal Doll.\n\nThis was Han Sen\u2019s first time there, so it all seemed just a little bit too coincidental.\n\n\u201cIt is because of that b*tch, Bai Ling Shuang,\u201d Bai Yi growled. \u201cOtherwise, why would I even come here?\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard this, he understood. Bai Ling Shuang was Princess Ten. She was the one that Bai Wei had a strong distaste for.\n\nHan Sen thought about it. He had met Bai Wuchang in the space station, and now he was meeting Bai Yi here. There was no way these two incidents were purely coincidental. He was afraid that the incident with Bai Wuchang had transpired because of Bai Ling Shuang\u2019s meddling.\n\nAlthough he had never seen Bai Ling Shuang before, he sort of understood what the woman was capable of doing.\n\n\u201cBai Ling Shuang told you to kill me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cNot exactly. Anyway, I am going to exact my revenge on that cheap b*tch.\u201d Bai Yi obviously didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Bai Ling Shuang must have set him up, and now things had obviously gone much farther than he had intended.\n\nBoth because of Han Sen and Bai Ling Shuang, these events would be forever branded into Bai Yi\u2019s heart. He must have really wanted both of them dead for different reasons.\n\n\u201cBut these are all matters for the future. Let\u2019s talk about you and me, right now. You want to take over my body, don\u2019t you? Well, that\u2019s impossible. Tell me what you are planning to do next,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBai Yi snorted in annoyance. \u201cReturn to Origin is a one-way ticket once it has been triggered. This is a process that you can never reverse. I will take over you; it is only a matter of time. And from this point on, you will not be able to gain power. Sooner or later, your body will submit and become mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure there is no other way?\u201d Han Sen asked seriously.\n\n\u201cOnly one of us can be left alive,\u201d Bai Yi replied calmly. He was very confident in the abilities of his Return to Origin.\n\n\u201cI was going to let you live, but if you don\u2019t want to live, then just know that you\u2019ve done this to yourself.\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nKilling a prince in King\u2019s Kingdom was quite a crazy thing to do. King Bai would obviously come to investigate the matter.\n\nThere were too many elites among the Extreme King. Many of them, like Mister White, had powerful predictive talents, so Han Sen couldn\u2019t be sure that he could keep Bai Yi\u2019s murder a secret. He didn\u2019t dare to kill a prince when his deed could be discovered.\n\nOr at least, he wouldn\u2019t if he didn\u2019t have a choice. If Bai Yi couldn\u2019t get out of his body, then he had to let King Bai know that Bai Yi had forced this situation upon them. If possible, he would help Bai Yi replace his body.\n\nWhen Bai Yi spoke again, his voice was full of scorn. \u201cI have melted into your cells. I am a part of your body now. Unless you kill yourself, here I am. What can you do about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all of the Bai family is as naive as you are, that would be great.\u201d Han Sen sighed. Bai Yi was the most retarded Bai family member he had met so far. Even Bai Wei was much smarter than he was.\n\nHe had been used by Bai Ling Shuang, but he had still strutted arrogantly around the entire time. Han Sen had no idea how he had managed to survive for so long in the Extreme King. It was a very competitive place to live in, after all.\n\n\u201cRight\u2026 Maybe no one cares for a big retard like him. Maybe no one will be too upset that he\u2019s dead,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. Then, his eyes started to turn white.\n\nThe white light blazed out of Han Sen, overwhelming his body with holy light. He started to take on the form of a holy god.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 this is impossible!\u201d Bai Yi screamed. He noticed that his Original Water King Body was being torn away from Han Sen\u2019s own cells.\n\nTerror suffused Bai Yi as he realized that his Original Water King Body was far inferior to this new power. The genes he saw now made Bai Yi so terrified.\n\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026 What is this power?! Why does my king body feel so scared? This is impossible! Our king bodies are the strongest bodies in the world\u2026 We have the strongest genes\u2026 There cannot be any genes that are stronger than ours\u2026\u201d Bai Yi felt his Original Water King Body beginning to detach from Han Sen\u2019s. That power was suppressing him, too. He couldn\u2019t move. He was so terrified, and his previous calm had vanished.\n\nHan Sen ignored Bai Yi\u2019s moaning. His whole body was in super god spirit mode now. In super god spirit mode, he tore out Bai Yi\u2019s Original Water King Body.\n\nThe Original Water King Body\u2019s genes were very strong, but in front of the super god spirit body, the king body was like dirt. Unless Han Sen absorbed and refined it, they wouldn\u2019t combine together.\n\nIn front of Han Sen\u2019s super god spirit body, Bai Yi felt like his high-level Original Water King Body had become a collection of low-level genes. He could only stare at that scary power now.\n\nAll those drops of water were like a babbling spring. Under the power of the super god spirit, Han Sen refined each droplet one by one.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t kill me\u2026 I can get out of you!\u201d Bai Yi finally felt fear. The Original power was being refined by Han Sen. He couldn\u2019t fathom how a Duke had managed to amass such wretched powers. Han Sen wasn\u2019t as strong and he wasn\u2019t a King yet, but even so\u2026 Bai Yi could see enough of Han Sen\u2019s genes to know that they were far better than his own Original Water King Body.\n\n\u201cIt is too late,\u201d Han Sen said simply. His super god spirit body became stronger.\n\nSince he had already cast the skill, he wasn\u2019t going to leave any trace of the prince behind.\n\n\u201cYou cannot kill me! I am Prince Sixteen! I am the son of King Bai! I\u2026\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s voice vanished. Under the thumb of Han Sen\u2019s super god spirit body, his Original Water King Body was refined in no time."
