    "text": "\u201cCool! You became an ant; how did you do that? Teach me! If I learn it, I can sneak into any women\u2019s locker rooms that I want to!\u201d Wang Yuhang\u2019s eyes opened wide. He looked at Han Sen, who was being held by Spell, and smiled.\n\nLittle Silver, Little Angel, and Dragon Lady looked at Han Sen\u2019s ant body curiously.\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. He sent his words to be spoken through Spell. So, Spell spoke for him by saying, \u201cCool my *ss! Go and find a way to turn me back to normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Wang Yuhang used his finger to poke Han Sen, and he laughed.\n\n\u201cStop! Poke me again and I\u2019ll be mad.\u201d Han Sen felt even sadder now. Being pressed by a finger felt as if he was being bullied.\n\nPlanet Eclipse\u2019s news channels were blocked. The others had not heard about what had happened to Han Sen during his time with the Buddha. So, Han Sen took the time to explain what had transpired.\n\n\u201cA deified elite\u2019s power? Even if we could suppress his ability, he\u2019d still be too powerful. It won\u2019t work, and none of us have the same element as him.\u201d Gu Qingcheng stopped to thought, and then proceeded to say, \u201cWhat about the power you used to transform? Even Purgatory Heaven did not work on you. Could you not try that?\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cIf there is no other option, I will have to do that. But I am afraid that if I recover too quickly from this state, Yisha might become suspicious. So, I will wait like this for a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be suspicious after a few days?\u201d Wang Yuhang did not understand.\n\n\u201cWhen I become an ant, I cannot use geno arts. I can only use The Story of Genes. If I can recover, I plan to use The Story of Genes as an excuse. Nobody else has ever practiced it before, so no one will know if I\u2019m telling the truth or not,\u201d Han Sen said, through Spell.\n\n\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s see if we can help you.\u201d Dragon Lady gathered up her power, and then put her finger on Han Sen. She wanted to send her power to him.\n\nIt was useless, though. Little Angel and Xie Qing King gave it a try as well. But the results were the same, and it did not work.\n\n\u201cYou guys did that on purpose.\u201d Han Sen watched them all come to press a finger against him. When he looked at their faces, he didn\u2019t feel quite right.\n\nLittle Angel and Dragon Lady were not Viscounts yet, but Gu Qingcheng and Xie Qing King were, so there was no need for them to use a finger to touch Han Sen. Even so, that was what they did.\n\n\u201cNo! I promise we did not plan on squashing you to death.\u201d Wang Yuhang laughed.\n\n\u201cI promise, it really isn\u2019t like that.\u201d Xie Qing King spoke with a tone of sincerity, but it was obvious that he was trying to suppress his urge to laugh.\n\n\u201cYou *ssholes!\u201d Han Sen felt so mad, and so he jumped atop Spell\u2019s shoulder. Spell then started to fire shiny bullets at them.\n\nAfter chasing them away, Han Sen took a break. He felt bored, so he decided to read the Consume skill that Yisha had given him.\n\nThe Consuming Ants were a famous higher race of the universe. They could consume everything, so they were far scarier than humans.\n\nHumans were omnivores, and they could eat both plants and animals. But the Consuming Ants were even better. They could eat metal, ore, any and all sorts of materials. There was nothing they were not able to digest.\n\nThe stronger the ant was, the more digesting power they had. The geno art they learned was called Consume. Practicing the skill required a body that was similar to the Consuming Ants, though.\n\nBurning Lamp Alpha could turn others into ants, but he hadn\u2019t given Han Sen the body of an actual Consuming Ant.\n\nHan Sen was just a common ant without any intelligence. He could not generate a geno armor, so there was no way he could learn Consume.\n\nHan Sen decided to give it a try anyway. After all, there was nothing else he could do while he was in the form of an ant.\n\nAfter Han Sen read through the geno art, he learned that Consume was able to fortify one\u2019s stomach. It made the digestion capabilities of a person\u2019s stomach quite scary. He could digest something like steel in a short amount of time, and turn all types of materials into energy. They would be absorbed by the body.\n\n\u201cThis would be good for people who love to eat. If they could learn this geno art, people could eat a lot more than usual in the sanctuary,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nWhen Han Sen had been in the sanctuaries, he had wanted a geno art that could digest stuff quickly. He had never been able to find a good one, though.\n\nConsume appeared to satisfy all of his needs, but only Consuming Ants could practice it.\n\nHan Sen wanted to try it, so he started practicing.\n\nHe thought it\u2019d be difficult, but after a few whirls, he felt a chill inside his stomach. It was an odd sensation.\n\n\u201cI can practice this?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nSince the skill was having an effect, that meant he could practice it.\n\nSince Han Sen had nothing to do, he kept practicing with Consume. He learned quickly, and he achieved beginner status in a few short days.\n\n\u201cI wonder if Metal Eater can practice something like this? I can take it back to the Sanctuary for him.\u201d\n\nBut Han Sen was just practicing for the time being. He didn\u2019t mean to practice it all that much, as he didn\u2019t want to be an ant forever.\n\nAfter a few days, Han Sen could not wait anymore. He wanted to see Ji Yanran, so after four or five days, he tried using his super god spirit mode.\n\nA holy light captured Han Sen\u2019s body. Wherever it went, he became a human again. He became a transparent super god spirit.\n\n\u201cIt works! Hopefully, I won\u2019t turn back into an ant when I deactivate the skill.\u201d Han Sen was worried, so he quickly stopped super god spirit mode.\n\nThe light disappeared from Han Sen\u2019s body, and he returned to his ordinary human form. He did not go back to the shape of an ant.\n\n\u201cGood! Being human is better than being an ant.\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nHe could not wait to use the Blood-Pulse Sutra to open a portal to the Sanctuaries. So, he went back to his home in the Alliance. Han Sen planned to stay there for a while. He wanted to delay revealing the fact that he had healed to Yisha.\n\nBut after chilling at home for a while, he felt uncomfortable being away from his usual life as an adventurer."
