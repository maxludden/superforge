    "text": "Of course, that was just a legend. The tree worked a little differently in reality, but the star fruit really did produce different kinds of xenogeneics. And they were at least King class.\n\n\u201cOuter Sky is an amazing place. If this star tree existed within the normal geno universe, it would throw the entire universe into war. No wonder the Very High never ask for anything or fight for resources like the Extreme King. In Outer Sky, even though their race only has a few hundred people, their resources are seemingly infinite.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen thought of that, he suddenly realized, \u201cOuter Sky is between the real world and the anti-material world. Is this zone independent? If it is, that means that a few hundred Very High are using a whole dimension\u2019s worth of resources. That is pretty awesome. Plus, Outer Sky has that Underworld Lake that connects to the anti-material world. They can get anti-material resources while still remaining connected to the real world. That suggests that the Very High have connections to all three worlds. What could be better than that?\u201d\n\nBut this didn\u2019t concern Han Sen. Han Sen hadn\u2019t been flying for long when Exquisite teleported toward him with Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cHow long are you going to fly around for? Let me take you there.\u201d Exquisite put a hand on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder and teleported him to the top of the tree.\n\nHan Sen, eyeing each and every star fruit that was nearby, made his choice of fruit carefully.\n\nExquisite told him the star fruit didn\u2019t really ripen, but the xenogeneics that were growing inside would make the shell turn dark red when they were grown. If someone picked a star fruit before that, the xenogeneics wouldn\u2019t be fully grown yet. The creatures within would be low level.\n\n\u201cLet me pick a few and try my luck.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t tell what xenogeneics the star fruits held. So, he didn\u2019t need to choose carefully. He found a nearby star fruit and flew toward it.\n\nThe shell of that star fruit was already dark red. It looked like a setting sun, the light of which could still be seen as it slipped beneath the horizon. The star fruit was red like an orb of fire.\n\nHan Sen flew to where the branch connected with the star fruit. Following the instructions that Exquisite had given him, he pressed his hand against it. And then, the giant star fruit fell from the branch.\n\nThe star fruit that fell was falling quickly. It didn\u2019t have the sense of mass and gravity that Han Sen had expected, though. It was actually very light.\n\nAs the star fruit fell, the dark red shell started to melt away. It looked like a giant fireball that was burning furiously, sloughing off layers of itself as it went.\n\nThe star fruit didn\u2019t release energy like you would expect from a fireball, though. It only took a second, and the shell of the giant star fruit dissolved completely. And there was a xenogeneic curled up inside.\n\nThat xenogeneic looked like a flying dragon. Its head was near its tail, and its wings were folded closed. Its body was covered in green scales. Judging from its long body and tail, it had to be at least 40 meters long.\n\n\u201cIt looks very powerful. It cannot be a deified xenogeneic, surely,\u201d Han Sen pondered, his heart thumping.\n\nExquisite said the star fruits mostly contained King xenogeneics, and very rarely, they would house a deified. But no matter what xenogeneic it was, it would be low level when it emerged. It would be like a freshly-born, first-tier King, or in rare instances, it would be a primitive deified.\n\nBut they progressed like ordinary xenogeneics after that, of course. They could be grown. How much they grew would depend on their talent.\n\nXenogeneics were woken from a deep slumber as they were freed from the core of the star fruit, so they were easy to kill as they emerged. Alternatively, the person who opened the fruit could allow the xenogeneics to fully awaken. The Very High had a special contract. If the xenogeneic signed the contract, then it would basically become the pet of the person who opened the fruit.\n\nOf course, this process couldn\u2019t be completed if the xenogeneic was hostile. If the creature resisted the contract, then it would remain dangerous and uncontrollable. That was why the Very High generally activated contracts when the xenogeneic inside the star fruit was still sleeping. Being asleep kept the creatures from resisting, granting a much higher success rate for the contracts.\n\n\u201cThis should be an aran dragon. It is a King class xenogeneic. If it is given enough resources, the aran dragon can be turned into a half-deified creature. It is a good xenogeneic to have,\u201d Exquisite said to Han Sen, as she watched the descent of the green dragon.\n\nHan Sen was very disappointed, though. It was a meager King class xenogeneic. For Han Sen, having such a creature would be practically pointless.\n\nExquisite could sense what Han Sen was thinking, so she said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t completely useless. Star beetles migrate through space, and they only periodically descend to the star tree. If you guard the star tree yourself, you will have to wait for the beetles to descend before taking them all out by yourself. If you had some helpers, however, they could kill the star beetles before they even reach the star tree. Plus, you might need some help once you begin to travel around Outer Sky. I suggest you sign contracts with most of the xenogeneics that emerge from the star fruit.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought that her suggestions were quite reasonable. The old man who originally guarded the star tree only let the beetles descend on the tree en masse because he needed them for Han Sen and Liyu Zhen\u2019s test. If he hadn\u2019t, he would have thinned out the star beetles long before they arrived at the tree.\n\nOrdinarily, the star beetles wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to touch the star tree. The old man would kill them before they got close. But even if Han Sen set up a defensive net of guardians, beetles would occasionally slip through the net. Han Sen would have to kill those himself.\n\nAnd of course, the old man had performed the task easily, but he had been much stronger than Han Sen currently was. If a large swarm of star beetles headed for the star tree, he would need some backup.\n\nHan Sen looked at the sleeping aran dragon. He knew it was going to wake up soon. He had to make a decision before then. If it woke up, he would be forced to kill it. It would be harder to force the creature into a contract once it was awake.\n\nSetting aside his hesitation, Han Sen used the method that Exquisite had taught him and initiated a contract with the aran dragon.\n\nWhen the contract was complete, a weird spell coalesced over the aran dragon. The spell flashed repeatedly, waking the aran dragon up.\n\nThe aran dragon spread its wings and unleashed a roar that shook the sky. Then, the beast looked down at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen curiously sent a thought toward the aran dragon, and the creature responded immediately. With a light flap of its wings, it lowered itself by Han Sen\u2019s feet.\n\nHan Sen stepped up onto the aran dragon\u2019s back. Feeling good, he said, \u201cHaving a mount will be pretty nice. I can use this guy like a transport ship. When I get enough resources from around Outer Sky, he can haul cargo for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still have another 49 star fruits to select. I hope I can get a few deified xenogeneics!\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. Then he turned and flew toward another star fruit."
