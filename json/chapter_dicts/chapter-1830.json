He knew how difficult the hardships were on the other side. Right now, those beyond ought to have been on the twelfth round of rain. Since Black Steel hadn\u2019t come out yet, there were only two possibilities.\n\nThe first option was that Black Steel was incredibly lucky, and he had found an incredible opportunity. The second option was that he was dead.\n\nIn the past, Barons had only managed to reach the eleventh stage; that was the height of their power. No one had ever successfully made it through the twelfth.\n\nThere was once a son of a king who was so ambitious, he stole a Duke\u2019s armor and took it to Knife Grave. He wanted to see how many rounds the knife rain would ultimately last.\n\nBut on the twelfth round, the young man came stumbling out with the Duke\u2019s armor mostly in tatters.\n\nWhen he was questioned, the Baron told his father that on the twelfth round, the knives came down like an endless stream. Even his Duke armor quickly broke down under the strain.\n\nThe Baron had managed to escape right before the Duke armor was entirely broken. If he hadn\u2019t gotten out in time, he would have been killed.\n\nThat was why Barons never attempted to take Duke armors with them. That young man\u2019s tale told everyone just how scary and powerful the knife rains could become.\n\nBlack-Moon King had already been waiting much longer than he had expected, but Black Steel was still inside. That was his only son, and he was incredibly worried. He stared at the black hole-like vortex. He was surrounded by many other Nobles, eager to see the final result.\n\nHis hands clenched into a pair of fists, as his own nails dug into his skin. He was never this nervous, not even when he was fighting someone.\n\nYisha was not in front of the tunnel, but she still frowned and stared toward the entrance.\n\nOn the Knife Grave planet, the knife river came down like a tsunami from the sky. It felt as if it was going to cut the entire planet in half.\n\nHan Sen and Black Steel\u2019s faces changed. They felt awful. They did not have Duke armor, and neither did they have an escape route.\n\nSuddenly, the knife river was practically above their heads.\n\nBlack Steel lobbed his horse knife and took Han Sen\u2019s Duke knife. Holding two knives, he jumped at the mass of the river and yelled, \u201cRun!\u201d\n\nThe knives came at the river like a whirlwind, tearing apart the skies. Black Steel managed to cut the knife river in half.\n\nIt was only for a second, though, and the knife river swiftly managed to bridge and refill the divide.\n\nKatcha!\n\nWith the impact he brought against the knife river, Black Steel\u2019s Earl weapon was broken against the tide. His hand bled, as a result His other hand, that was clutching the Duke knife, now had a few crevices running across it\n\nThe impact with the knife river was too strong. The Duke knife was pushed to the side. The knives rushed by Black Steel like water.\n\nBlack Steel looked at the knife river and his eyes moved. He realized he would die this time, and there was no way out for him. Seeing endless knives line up together, so close to his body, it would only take a second for them to chop and dice him into pieces.\n\nBut the knives suddenly stopped, and they froze where they were in the air. They hung there, motionless, blanketing the sky. The knives were almost into his flesh and his eyes, but the spectacle had all suddenly stopped.\n\nSha! Sha!\n\nSuddenly, it was like time began running backwards. The knives reversed course. They moved 100 meters away before coming to a stop.\n\nThe weapons started to spin, and so too did the ones on the ground,\n\nCountless weapons were spinning like tornados. They were everywhere, and Black Steel couldn\u2019t even have guessed how many there were.\n\nAs the weapons spun, they also began to tremble. It seemed almost like they were afraid of something.\n\nBlack Steel slowly turned around and looked at Han Sen. Han Sen\u2019s clothes were waving as he cast his knifemind. He looked like a beast that was on the verge of ripping the galaxy apart\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Black Steel looked at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen possessed a knifemind that was greater than that of Black Steel\u2019s father, Black-Moon King. Even Knife Queen was likely inferior to him.\n\nHan Sen now had Black Steel\u2019s horse knife. He had planned to use his knifemind and Centaur shield so they could think about what they might do to escape the space tunnel.\n\nThe effects of using the knifemind were more surprising than anticipated, however. It looked as if the knives felt his knifemind, and they sought to back-off. Han Sen no longer needed to summon his shield anymore.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knifemind came from the scabbard. The scabbard\u2019s knifemind originated with the Rebate; their only deified elite. Han Sen\u2019s power was far worse, of course. But even so, his knifemind was deified in caliber. Although it wasn\u2019t as good as the real thing, it was still good.\n\nThe knives weren\u2019t creatures, but when they felt the knifemind, they were shocked. That was why they were shaking, and unable to leave.\n\nSuddenly, a knife fell from the sky and hit the ground. It almost landed on Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\nHan Sen fell back and dodged it.\n\nHe looked down and saw the knife that was now protruding from a rock. The scabbard and the handle were all rusted, and there was no handguard at all. It looked like a steel rod that was just a little bit curved.\n\n\u201cWeird. All these knives are scared of the knifemind. So, why did this one decide to come down?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He knelt by the knife, grabbed it by the handle, and tried to pull it from the rock.\n\nHan Sen wanted to remove it from the rock and see what might have been special about it, but it didn\u2019t budge. He tried yanking it a few times, but nothing worked.\n\n\u201cLittle Black, why can I not pull this out?\u201d Han Sen asked over his shoulder, just as the knife jerked out of the ground. He tossed it to Black Steel for inspection.\n\nHan Sen put away his knifemind. The weapons then seemed to lose all support, and they all fell to the ground. Within the proximity of a hundred meters, weapons were everywhere.\n\nBlack Steel looked at Han Sen strangely, then he looked at the knife in his hands. Then he threw it back to Han Sen, saying, \u201cThis is not a long knife with a scabbard. It is a knife\u2019s child or a knife stick. It isn\u2019t a knife yet. It\u2019s half finished.\u201d"
