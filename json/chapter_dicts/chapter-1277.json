It was a risk to do so, and he didn\u2019t like committing to uncertainties. Plus, opening his tenth gene lock was only a matter of time, anyway. It wasn\u2019t worth the risk, all in all.\n\nIf there were adverse side-effects to the consumption of the Aqua Fruit cores, they could be lethal. As such, he chose to leave them be for now.\n\nPurple Emperor was an emperor, but due to its deprivation of nutrition before birth, it lacked the power to equal others of its class.\n\nIf Han Sen gave him an Aqua Fruit, there was a chance that could be fixed, and the spirit would be as fit as a fiddle with all ten gene locks open. With an emperor like that by his side, Han Sen would have no trouble taking on and taking down Saint Fan Shelter.\n\nHe summoned Purple Emperor, peeled away the fruit, and fed him the core.\n\nPurple Emperor had no clue what it was, but since Han Sen commanded him to consume it, he did not hesitate in swallowing it. When the core slid down his throat, it dissolved into a gentle liquid that reinvigorated his body.\n\nHan Sen felt a change in Purple Emperor\u2019s lifeforce, and the color of his body started to turn a certain shade of green.\n\nWhen the new color grew, the emperor\u2019s overall color became a mixture of purple and blue.\n\nBoom!\n\nPurple Emperor\u2019s body began to leak gas. He hadn\u2019t farted; it was just that this gas was starting to seep out of the pores on his body.\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t be able to notice a difference, but through the use of Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen could see that Purple Emperor had been reborn. He was a totally different spirit now.\n\nHan Sen was delighted with the results. It had actually become difficult to sense Purple Emperor\u2019s lifeforce now, which painted him like some sort of silent reaper.\n\nHan Sen brought him over to the training room. After a session of practice, one-versus-one, with no transformations involved, Han Sen was hopeless against him.\n\n\u201cThat core is the bee\u2019s knees. I should save the other one for the silver fox.\u201d Han Sen decided to work on opening the tenth gene lock by himself, so he saved the second for his favorite pet.\n\nWhen Han Sen found the silver fox, he teased him with the core.\n\nHan Sen wanted to spend more time with the silver fox, and when the time came to open the Holy Door, he hoped they could ascend together.\n\nBut when the silver fox looked at the core, his interest quickly diminished. Then he walked away and went to rest elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAll these emperors are fighting for this thing, and you have no interest?\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nIf the silver fox wasn\u2019t going to eat it, then neither was Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThen who should I give it to?\u201d Han Sen could not decide.\n\nIt seemed the Aqua Fruit was not to everyone\u2019s tastes. He had a few king spirits in his service, though; ones he could help. But such numbers proved troublesome for this decision. He liked them all, and providing a boon to just one was a difficult choice.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll just pocket it for now.\u201d Han Sen thought about giving it to the fish king, but he imagined it might become a demi-god immediately after.\n\nWith the fish king in the water, nothing could threaten Han Sen there. They were now buddies of a sort, after all. And if the fish king ascended, it would only be a matter of time before something else took its place.\n\n\u201cLet me take down Blood River Shelter first.\u201d Han Sen took the silver fox and Bao\u2019er with him.\n\nHe kept Purple Emperor in the shelter, as taking the silver fox would be much safer for him.\n\nHan Sen approached the shelter, and as he went, he thought about the Battle Geno Essences he had collected.\n\nThey had the term \u201cGeno Essence\u201d in their title, but they most certainly weren\u2019t like Life Geno Essences. Han Sen had tried absorbing them through his usual trick of simulating energy flows, but he wasn\u2019t successful.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t find a way in which he could make use of them.\n\nXue Yucheng was in Blood River Shelter, and the man hoped the Xue family would come to his rescue, or at least take the item so he could die without worry.\n\nBut a while had passed since Han Sen had been given the message, and no one had yet come. Today, however, he saw Han Sen once again. Gritting his teeth to bear the pain once more, he crucified himself and started driving the boat over to meet with him.\n\n\u201cYoung Man, did you deliver the message?\u201d Xue Yucheng asked.\n\nHan Sen shook his head and said, \u201cSorry, I was a little busy collecting fruit.\u201d\n\nXue Yucheng looked concerned and seemed to be in a worried rush. He said, \u201cYou have to believe me! If you deliver the intel, you will be rewarded handsomely!\u201d\n\nHan Sen responded with an explanation, saying, \u201cCalm down, pops. I don\u2019t need to ask for the aid of anyone. The Xue family are actually the ones who requested that I help you guys out. I have come here to save you. That\u2019s why I was here before, but then something else came up. But I\u2019m here now to help!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Xue Yucheng asked, his tone suggesting that it was a legitimate question.\n\n\u201cDo you remember this?\u201d Han Sen pulled out an item Xue Feiyan had given him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Ice Ring! In that case, you just need to find Xue Chen. If you show him that ring, he\u2019ll give you the item. Then, all you must do is take it home.\u201d Xue Feiyan looked relieved after seeing the ring. And ease had definitely been brought to his worries.\n\nHan Sen thought it best to show the ring instead of wasting any more time.\n\nHan Sen put it away now, and said, \u201cI\u2019m taking down Blood River Shelter, so you can be that elusive item\u2019s mailman and save me the trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou jest, surely! How might you do such a thing?\u201d Xue Yucheng\u2019s face was painted with a mixture of varying emotions.\n\n\u201cThis is no joke. We\u2019ll conquer it; just the three of us.\u201d Han Sen raised a finger to point at the silver fox and Bao\u2019er each.\n\nXue Yucheng balked. \u201cStop joking, man! We need to be serious now and discuss how we get you inside. We\u2019ve got plans to formulate!\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything more, and simply proceeded towards the shelter."
