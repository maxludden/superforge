After a brief talk, they heard wolves howling in the distance.\n\nWhen the sounds subsided, the lightning trees seemed to react as if a message was being relayed, passed from tree to tree.\n\nChen Hu and the others were unnerved at the sight, and mournfully realized that their trials might not be over.\n\nIn the distance, the surviving wolves prowled in the undergrowth and watched the travelers.\n\n\u201cCome and fight us, if you dare! Your howls will accomplish nothing!\u201d Chen Hu was annoyed, and their constant watching made him itch. He couldn\u2019t help but blurt out insults towards them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just hasten our passage and leave this forest as soon as we can,\u201d Lin Weiwei said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. There\u2019s no need to be. If they come closer, I am sure our friend Han Sen will re-activate their retardation mode,\u201d Chen Hu said.\n\n\u201cTalking will only slow us down. We should hurry; I have only opened my fourth gene lock. And if there are sacred-blood creatures amongst them, my powers won\u2019t be half as effective. It\u2019ll be bad news, if we have to face-off against sacred-blood wolves,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s only one wolf king. And it\u2019s only sacred-blood!\u201d Chen Hu let out a hearty laugh.\n\nThey continued walking through the forest, and they espied more and more wolves amassing on the fringes of their sight. There were dozens of sharp, gleaming eyes watching them.\n\nSome followed them from behind, others were up front. Every now and again, they all howled.\n\n\u201cOh no! There must be at least a thousand of them around us, by now,\u201d Lin He said.\n\nThey did not see the wolf king, but the number of subordinate wolves was enough to strike fear into their hearts.\n\nChen Hu did not say anything now, and Lin Weiwei\u2019s nerves looked wracked. Things did not look good for the band of travelers.\n\nIf Lin He had Dongxuan Aura, it would have been far more effective. But he didn\u2019t, and Han Sen\u2019s senses were the best of the group. This meant he was the one who had to remain the most alert. And Han Sen knew the number of wolves around them was greater than Lin He\u2019s estimation. There was, in fact, twenty-three hundred wolves baying for their blood.\n\nAlthough there were no sacred-blood creatures, it was a terrifying number for even the strongest person to think of competing with.\n\n\u201cThose wolves sure look hungry. Please, remain vigilant.\u201d As Lin He said this, the sacred-blood wolf king revealed itself.\n\nBefore they could react, though, four more wolf kings appeared. They each came from a different direction, surrounding them on all sides.\n\n\u201cMe and my big mouth.\u201d Chen Hu wished he could take back what he had said, and did not incite any further ire from the wolves by taunting them.\n\nEven though Han Sen could deal with the legions of mutant wolves, the combined strength of the sacred-blood wolf kings was out of his league.\n\nHooooowl! The five wolf kings howled in unison, and after that, all the lesser wolves began running towards the group with a ravenous appetite.\n\nHan Sen quickly snuffed out their senses, for a re-enactment of what had occurred earlier.\n\n\u201cPah! So dumb! Have they not learned a thing?\u201d Chen Hu tried to lighten the mood.\n\nBut unlike last time, the wolves did not stop and wander about aimlessly. They seemed to react better to their disability, and they ran forward at a decent pace.\n\nPang!\n\nA wolf came into contact with a lightning tree, which rattled it. From the boughs above, many leaves began to fall.\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Lin He screamed.\n\nIt was a new tactic. The wolves mindlessly charged forward to bash the trees and make the forest rain those electrifying leaves.\n\nThe lightning danced from leaf to leaf in sparkling freefall.\n\nEveryone drew a weapon and tried to cut the leaves before they could touch them.\n\nWith every connection of a leaf to a weapon, the leaves exploded in a firework of electricity. It was a frightful sight.\n\nThe leaves were like rainfall, and one leaf was enough to injure you so grievously, you could no longer raise a weapon.\n\n\u201cThese wolves are smart,\u201d Lin Weiwei said, as her once-hopeful spirit began to sink.\n\nWith a wry smile, Han Sen responded, \u201cI underestimated their cunning. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that they came up with a solution for our initial trick.\u201d\n\nLin He was shredding the airborne leaves like a madman, and without him there, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive the leaf-rain as long as they did.\n\nThe wolves did not relent in their bashing of the trees. And as more and more leaves departed their harboring branches, many wolves decided to rush to the fighters and do what they could in close-quarter combat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my time to shine.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s skin started to turn red, as if he was a being formed of blood.\n\nHis black pupils turned red, with many rings emerging within.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s pupils soon had seven of these rings, indicating his Blood-Pulse Sutra had seven gene locks active.\n\nHe only had a fitness of fifteen hundred. If he activated his eighth gene lock, he wouldn\u2019t be able to last very long, and he\u2019d most likely end up damaging his own body.\n\nHan Sen ran the Phoenix hyper geno art, and his body burst into a living brazier of wild flames.\n\nThe fire was no longer black, either. Due to the effect of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, the fire looked demonically red. It was terrifying."
