    "text": "Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was waiting for Auntie Mei and the others to get rid of Han Sen in the astral instrument\u2019s realm. Not long later, he saw the zone disappear. With its removal, a body fell out.\n\nWhen he had a closer look, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was shocked. He could not believe what he was seeing.\n\nHan Sen was holding the astral instrument. He was standing in the hall. Old Vulture, the eyeless beast, and Auntie Mei were bloody and lying on the floor. They all looked terribly injured.\n\nThis was very shocking. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not say anything. He wanted to leave the hall and escape into the darkness.\n\n\u201cGrandmaster, are you going to leave without saying goodbye?\u201d Han Sen suddenly appeared in front of Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. He prohibited Ancient Abyss Grandmaster from following the path he had chosen to depart by.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster knew it was futile to say anything. He had to go through this to live. He shook his body. Suddenly, eight of his clones appeared. They went in eight different directions.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He could not tell which one was the true Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. The eight clones shared the same presence as Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. All of them looked as if they shared the same body.\n\n\u201cGrandmaster, there is no rush to leave,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. His body flashed. He took out his cause karma knife. He slashed out eight knife lights. They were slashing toward Grandmaster\u2019s eight clones.\n\nThe knife was still the same knife. The knife skill was still the same knife skill. Because Han Sen\u2019s true god power made him much stronger than before, he could slash eight times. Eight knife lights almost slashed eight clones instantly.\n\nSeven clones were destroyed. Only one clone had a turtle shield that blocked Han Sen\u2019s strike.\n\nThe teeth power hit the turtle shield. It created a deep mark. It almost broke the shield. The powerful strength hit the shield, and Ancient Abyss Grandmaster went flying. He was spilling blood.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe turtle shield was cut in half. Although one slash did not break it, with the teeth power\u2019s ripping power, the turtle shield had been broken.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster was in space. He dropped the broken turtle shield and quickly went flying into the darkness. He was like lightning or a weird bird. He used a borrowing strength skill. Han Sen\u2019s slash power became the fuel for his escape.\n\n\u201cVery good Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.\u201d Han Sen had to compliment him. After all, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was a worthy grandmaster for the Extreme King.\n\n\u201cIf you seek to leave this place now, you have underestimated me.\u201d Han Sen used the astral instrument that he had just recently possessed. Suddenly, the sky was full of starlight. He put Ancient Abyss Grandmaster into its realm.\n\n\u201cGrandmaster, thank you for your astral instrument. If you didn\u2019t do this, you could have escaped.\u201d Han Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and smiled.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster had a wry smile as he said, \u201cIf I knew you were this strong, you could have easily dealt with the fish bird and eyeless demon. Then, I would not have had to do what I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are you planning to do now?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nUpon hearing him, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked at him in shock and asked, \u201cDoes that mean you are not going to kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what you need to ask yourself,\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster quietly asked.\n\n\u201cYou and everything you know.\u201d Han Sen had a lot of questions about the Extreme King. The most likely people that could answer him were either the grandmaster or Bai King.\n\n\u201cI do not know much. I just do everything the king commands me to do.\u201d While he was talking, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster\u2019s hands suddenly flipped. A weird coin appeared in his hands. When he flipped his hands, the coin twisted space and dropped his body in space.\n\n\u201cSee you later, Brother Han!\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster\u2019s voice came from that space as his body vanished.\n\n\u201cDid I approve of your departure?\u201d Han Sen saw Ancient Abyss Grandmaster disappear in space, so he summoned his pistols and fired at the twisted space.\n\nPang!\n\nThe space exploded. That twisted space was frozen. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was stuck in space. He could not totally go into space, but he could not drop out of the space either. He could no longer do anything. He was stuck inside that portal.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster\u2019s expression changed. He had a true god ying-yang space coin. It was able to locate a direction. He needed to use the ying-yang space coin to teleport wherever he chose.\n\nUnfortunately, using the ying-yang space coin took time. He spoke to Han Sen so he could set it up.\n\nWhen the ying-yang space coin activated, even the space powers and time powers could not stop sending him back. Yet Han Sen\u2019s power froze the entire portal. It was hard to imagine.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster knew he was unable to run, so he immediately said, \u201cAsk me whatever it is you wish to know. If I know, I will tell you everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandmaster is so smart. You have so many tricks. I will not dare to ask you stuff here.\u201d Han Sen raised his hand. A metal tower appeared. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was stuck with Forever Solid power. He was about to be taken into Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster wanted to fight back, but Han Sen shot him once more. He could not move, so he was sucked into Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nSeeing Ancient Abyss Grandmaster trapped on the seventh floor of Destiny\u2019s Tower, Han Sen put away the astral instrument and returned to the holy palace\u2019s plaza.\n\nOld Vulture, the eyeless big beast, and Auntie Mei were in front of the hall. They looked at Han Sen weirdly.\n\nHan Sen was in a rush to get to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, so he ignored them. He did not expect their wounds to have healed in such a short amount of time. They were almost fully recovered. It was no wonder why they were true god xenogeneics.\n\nHan Sen walked through the holy palace and asked the three of them, \u201cWhere is Littleflower?\u201d\n\n\u201cLittleflower really isn\u2019t at the palace. Old Cat took him to the sanctuaries to harvest genes.\u201d Auntie Mei answered Han Sen\u2019s question. Her attitude was a bit different from before. Her answers were different too.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Han Sen coldly asked. He kept walking.\n\n\u201cWe told you Littleflower is not here!\u201d the eyeless big beast screamed. \u201cWhat else do you seek to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I want to do? I thought I told you ages ago.\u201d Han Sen kept walking. He raised his cause karma knife. He brought the knife above his head and slashed it down. Scary knife air was rushing through the hall. \u201cToday, I will tear down the holy palace.\u201d"
