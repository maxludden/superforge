Unfortunately, there were hardly any humans in a position to handle the shelters and land, so he had to allow spirits to remain alive and serve as stewards for the time being.\n\nThe spirits were right in this assumption. When they feared Han Sen\u2019s takeover, they guessed he would need to keep the spirits alive to handle matters. And aside from saving humans, he couldn\u2019t actually take over and rule the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. It just wasn\u2019t feasible.\n\nSpirits gained power at a decent, steady rate. But humans had always been slow in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and although things were better now, they\u2019d still take a long time to gain what was necessary to start ruling the lands Han Sen had claimed.\n\nHan Sen was currently resting in a shelter. He was asleep, but he was roused from his slumber by the detection of someone near. Someone not very familiar to him had entered his private garden.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s heightened senses, he knew that person had to be powerful if he had only now just been noticed.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Retribution?\u201d It was God\u2019s Retribution, one of the thirteen members of Blood Legion.\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution seemed to be at ease, and he sat down gently, saying, \u201cSuper Spank? Ha! That\u2019s a good one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got lucky. And besides, I didn\u2019t name it that,\u201d Han Sen said, unsure of the relationship that was supposed to exist between them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s your goal to take over the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary,\u201d God\u2019s Retribution said, with a smile.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve heard right,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that, if I were you,\u201d God\u2019s Retribution said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate you\u2019re not me. But tell me; why?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution looked over to the pool of water and told him, \u201cBlood Legion knew about super geno points, and we\u2019ve been killing super creatures since long before the existence of them became common knowledge. We didn\u2019t inform humanity about any of it; do you know why that is?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was not surprised they could gather super geno points with the strength they had. They were far stronger than average humans, after all, and it\u2019d be baffling to hear them say they had never killed one before.\n\nHan Sen was curious about what the man was looking to tell him, though. So, he played along and said, \u201cNo. Why?\u201d\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution explained, \u201cHumans are actually the invaders of this place. By coming to the sanctuaries, humans broke the balance. Typical human behavior, really; like parasites. Although there is an abundance of resources, creatures, and spirits here, we slowly break the balance established in these realms. Before, when humans were unable to slay super creatures, things were already bad. After their slaying of those became common, we hit a slippery slope. The ecosystems of the sanctuaries are suffering.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned and said, \u201cCreatures can nest and shoot out more babies, can\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know how many years it takes to produce an egg? And if you do, do you know how many eggs have been broken since your lie? Two centuries down the line we are currently treading, humans will be fighting each other for super geno points.\u201d\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution was genuinely concerned, and it appeared to grieve him to speak of these matters. After a lengthy pause and sigh, he went on to say, \u201cAnd a lot of that has to do with you. You\u2019re a remarkable person, I must tell you. But you\u2019re speeding up this process; a process that will only lead to ruin. If you continue doing what you\u2019re doing, this will happen faster than it did for the First God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood Legion didn\u2019t tell anyone on purpose? To avoid this from happening? I\u2019d consider that noble, if it wasn\u2019t also selfish,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution responded to the slight, explaining, \u201cWe were delaying the inevitable. We knew it was only a matter of time before the existence of super creatures and Life Geno Essences were found out, and we just wanted to make these ecosystems last. You\u2019ve heard it before, surely, but humans really are horrible creatures. Their mistreatment in this sanctuary was a well-needed humbling. Everywhere else, we\u2019re parasites; invading one place until its sucked dry, before multiplying and bringing the same fate elsewhere. Take a look at the First God\u2019s Sanctuary and you\u2019ll see what I mean. What a sorry sight that place is, in recent times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be something we can do to alleviate the issue, surely,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution said, \u201cIf humans insist on becoming part of the cycle, adjustments can be made. But like I said, we were delaying the inevitable, and whether or not we can truly be a part of things in the sanctuaries and co-exist with the current laws, I can\u2019t say for certain.\u201d\n\nHe went on to reassert his meaning by again saying, \u201cHumans have upset the balance of the sanctuaries. The First God\u2019s Sanctuary is bad enough as it is, but you are making things worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that already. But what if I decide to continue down the road I\u2019m currently headed? What would you plan to do about that?\u201d Han Sen asked, needling God\u2019s Retribution to learn as much as he could about what he wanted.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t stop you. The trail you blaze is your own, but with how people see you, you should set a better example. If your heirs are one day killing each other for a measly scrap of flesh, you can\u2019t roll in your grave and say we didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d God\u2019s Retribution said, then turned to leave.\n\nHan Sen thought he\u2019d be threatened, and he readied himself for a fight. With his strength now, he was keen to stress the limits of how powerful Blood Legion members truly were.\n\nHan Sen did not expect him to immediately say his piece and then leave.\n\nHe thought the encounter had been rather strange, and his perception of Blood Legion had been altered somewhat, after it. He thought Blood Legion was an evil, slightly scary organization, but they were obviously concerned for the overall trajectory humanity was headed on.\n\nBlood Legion cared about the environment like the people of Greenpeace. And the thought of those two organizations sharing similar goals was something he was struggling to comprehend.\n\n\u201cGo to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. I\u2019ll be waiting for you there, and when we do next meet, let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t be as enemies.\u201d God\u2019s Retribution swiftly left after saying this.\n\nHan Sen now understood these were his parting words, and the only chance they\u2019d have to speak before his departure to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. This was God\u2019s Retribution\u2019s goodbye."
