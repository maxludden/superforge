    "text": "\u201cThe fact that you studied on Extreme Mountain is none of my business,\u201d Han Sen thought. \u201cIf you want a risky fight, there are xenogeneics everywhere. Why pick on me? I killed that worthless Bai Yi, and now the Extreme King want me dead. But if I had killed this much-loved boy Bai Wuchang, King Bai would likely come after me himself. Why am I considered the one who started all this?\u201d\n\nBut Bai Wuchang wasn\u2019t going to give him the chance to stop fighting. The prince was raging more and more. The ghost-like body became solid, but something about it still seemed incorporeal. Looking at it was like looking at an illusion.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Bai Wuchang\u2019s blue knife darkened to black. It felt as if some black substance chains were writhing just under the surface.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of knife skills are these? They\u2019re going to produce substance chains just like the black tiger I met previously. Although the substance chains haven\u2019t fully formed yet, if he can manage to do this, Bai Wuchang has a ninety percent chance of becoming deified,\u201d Han Sen thought as he observed Bai Wuchang.\n\nBai Wuchang\u2019s eyes were on fire. His gaze was invasive as it crept over Han Sen. \u201cThe road up Extreme Mountain is arduous. There is a ninety percent chance of dying, and there is only a ten percent chance of surviving. The gambit\u2019s rewards, however, are very big. I earned Extreme Mountain\u2019s prestigious skill called Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light. One hit can destroy everything, so you better watch it!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I not, please?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking frustrated.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d When Bai Wuchang answered, he was already attacking.\n\nThe black knife\u2019s light came at Han Sen. There was no stopping it. It was like the knife had never even moved. The moment the knife light appeared was the moment it was inside Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cIt is the same as the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel. It is a power that can affect the self-cogwheels of other creatures.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Because it was used directly on his self-cogwheel, the strike was almost impossible to dodge. It was a devastating attack.\n\nBut it was different from the Blood-Pulse Sutra. The Blood-Pulse Sutra pushed the self-cogwheels of others. Bai Wuchang\u2019s knife light destroyed the self-cogwheels of others.\n\nIf the self-cogwheel was broken, that meant the person would be almost dead, and their lifeforce would be gone.\n\nDodging that blow wouldn\u2019t be difficult if he was farther away from Bai Wuchang; as the distance between them increased, the effect on Han Sen\u2019s self-cogwheel would be weakened. That meant the strike would be weaker.\n\nBut Han Sen hadn\u2019t known Bai Wuchang could unleash a strike such as this. He was too close to Bai Wuchang. It was too late to dodge now, so he had no choice but to accept that hit.\n\nA power inside Han Sen\u2019s body moved. A self-cogwheel was spinning. That cogwheel was flashing with a weird symbol. It was The Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel.\n\nBai Wuchang\u2019s black knife light went into him and struck his self-cogwheel, but it was unable to move Han Sen\u2019s self-cogwheel. The black knife hit the self-cogwheel and broke. It shattered into chunks of a black substance, then dissolved.\n\n\u201cIt looks like your skill is nothing substantial,\u201d Han Sen said to Bai Wuchang, who looked frozen.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 impossible\u2026\u201d Bai Wuchang stared at Han Sen in disbelief. Han Sen was at the perfect distance for him to use his Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light.\n\nAt this distance, Bai Wuchang believed that he could eliminate any being in the universe that was beneath the deified level. Even killing a half-deified would die as easy as chopping the head off a chicken. Both would die in one hit.\n\nBut Han Sen had been hit by the strongest unleashing of his Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light, and nothing had happened. Bai Wuchang could scarcely believe it.\n\nAlthough Bai Wuchang couldn\u2019t see self-cogwheels, he knew that the Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light was a very mysterious and scary power. It ignored all types of defenses to kill the lifeforce directly.\n\nHan Sen simply wasn\u2019t affected by the Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light.\n\nAs Bai Wuchang stared at Han Sen\u2019s motionless form, he stopped swinging. He just gripped his knife, unsure of what to do.\n\n\u201cDo you want to keep going?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Bai Wuchang.\n\n\u201cI lose, but next time\u2026\u201d Before Bai Wuchang could finish, Han Sen interrupted violently.\n\n\u201cNext time, my f*cking *ss!\u201d Han Sen jumped forward. He leaped in front of Bai Wuchang and punched him square in the face. A scary power caved-in Bai Wuchang\u2019s entire skull. Blood squelched from the mashed-in face and around Han Sen\u2019s fist. Bai Wuchang was sent flying.\n\nHan Sen followed after the soaring victim. His fists and legs were like a storm, raining down blows on Bai Wuchang.\n\nHan Sen was enraged, and there was no stopping him now. Bai Wuchang\u2019s flesh tore and his bones shattered under the assault. He couldn\u2019t even fight back as Han Sen beat his body to a pulp.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy madman! You think you\u2019re so strong, don\u2019t you? You think you can do anything you want just because you\u2019re King Bai\u2019s son!\u201d Han Sen kept speaking as he punched. His fists kept landing on Bai Wuchang\u2019s face, utterly annihilating his skull. The man\u2019s eyeballs were squashed, and his nose was reversed into what was left of his face.\n\nHan Sen was still so angry. He kept punching like mad, breaking all of the other man\u2019s bones. Bai Wuchang screamed until he could scream no longer.\n\nFang Qing Yu and the pirates were all frozen. That was King Bai\u2019s favorite son. Han Sen had killed Bai Yi, which led to a universal APB being put on him. If he killed Bai Wuchang, King Bai would come after him personally.\n\nBai Wuchang\u2019s Ghost King Body, his Ghost Knife skills, and his Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light were so strong. But he was too focused on power. His techniques, his strength, and his timing with areas were shoddy.\n\nHe was able to destroy enemies that couldn\u2019t defeat his powers. But if he met someone as strong as him, he would end up getting crushed.\n\nHan Sen grabbed Bai Wuchang and lifted him like a sack of wet mud. He carried the man back to the white whale. Han Sen tossed him down, and blood sprayed everywhere when the Extreme King prince hit the floor in a boneless heap.\n\nFang Qing Yu and the pirates stared at Bai Wuchang on the floor. He didn\u2019t look human anymore. If not for his Ghost King Body, he would have been killed.\n\nAll of the pirates were thinking, \u201cHe could have offended anyone but this guy. I can\u2019t believe he even beat up King Bai\u2019s favorite son so badly. There\u2019s no one he wouldn\u2019t dare to punch.\u201d\n\n\u201cLock him up. Take him as a hostage. If the Extreme King people still dare come for us, I will cut his head off.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face was as hard a granite.\n\nRage still boiled through Han Sen. He had met many fighting maniacs in his time, like Lone Bamboo. But even Lone Bamboo had his limits. This Bai Wuchang, however, was all about killing. He didn\u2019t have a reason, and he didn\u2019t need one. It was all about killing for him.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen\u2019s self-cogwheel was as hard as it was. And he had the Eternity solidifying powers. The self-cogwheels of ordinary creatures would have been destroyed by Bai Wuchang\u2019s strike. If a person\u2019s self-cogwheel broke, then they were essentially dead. The state they were left in was worse than being a vegetable."
