    "text": "Knife Grave\n\n\u201cQueen didn\u2019t tell you before you came?\u201d Black Steel frowned.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cQueen didn\u2019t tell me anything. She just told me to come here, and that was that.\u201d\n\nBlack Steel quietly said, \u201cQueen is indeed different She has her own plans, though, I assume. If she didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nAfter a pause, Black Steel went on to say, \u201cThese volcanos are the graves of the knives. A lot of knives are buried here, and the knives come out when the tunnel is opened. They await a new master. We are here to select new weapons for ourselves. We are also being picked by the weaponry. There won\u2019t be good quality knives at the beginning, mind you. Later on, there will be a higher chance of finding good knives. But even so, they are rare. You need to get them, but also earn their approval. For that, you will require power and luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did these weapons come from, then?\u201d Han Sen asked, with shock.\n\n\u201cI do not know, but this portal opens once a year. Where the knives actually come from, I\u2019ve never been told. If they are not chosen, they will return to their graves. They await the next host of participants in a year\u2019s time, with the hope they might be chosen,\u201d Black Steel said.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the weapons we take belong to us?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He wanted to collect a few, so he could give them to his family. It would be best to give them to his son, his grandson, and great-grandson, in case he could never return.\n\n\u201cOur race has a rule: only one knife can be taken by each person.\u201d Black Steel looked at Han Sen coldly, as if he knew what Han Sen was thinking.\n\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Han Sen looked disappointed, but then he asked, \u201cTowards the end, what might their level be? Are any of them deified knives?\u201d\n\nBlack Steel\u2019s mouth twitched. He knew Han Sen was a greedy person, who was not even concerned with hiding that fact.\n\nHe had no clue why Queen might accept a student such as this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The knife rain will fall once an hour, however. After the seventh rain comes, Viscount class blades will become available. It\u2019ll be hard to dodge those knives. Across the years, no one has lasted longer than ten rounds. The best knives that have ever been found were Duke knives.\u201d Black Steel answered Han Sen\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cDuke class? That\u2019s not bad.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\nBlack Steel felt as if he had been talking far too much to Han Sen. Strangely, he was also in a brighter mood. He couldn\u2019t help but ask Han Sen, \u201cDid you bring any high-tier armor and weapons with you to this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Queen said I did not have to.\u201d Han Sen looked at Black Steel, and it seemed as if he had not brought anything, either.\n\nBlack Steel said, \u201cDo you think a Baron can block a Viscount knife rain? The knife rain is not like this, and it could last up to ten minutes. When they fall down, they will come with the full strength of a Viscount\u2019s attack. Without high-tier armor and weapons, how well do you think you will fare in the blocking?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Black Steel without speaking. If the high-tier armor and weapons worked, Yisha would have let him bring them. But Black Steel hadn\u2019t brought his either, so there must have been a reason for that.\n\nBlack Steel continued by saying, \u201cIt is actually pointless to bring them. Bringing those items will only help you last a bit longer. But if you bring other items to help you, the knives you wish for will not choose to follow you. They would sooner break themselves than allow themselves to be used by the likes of you. You have to use your own, raw power to obtain the weapon of your choice. It\u2019s all down to you, and a modicum of luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the seventh rain, maybe I can find an Earl weapon. After that, there might be Marquis and Duke. But they are extremely rare, and that really will depend on your luck.\u201d\n\nAfter Black Steel said this, he ignored Han Sen. He took off in the direction of a volcano.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going? Han Sen followed him.\n\nBlack Steel seemed okay with this. Han Sen thought following a guy who knew the way might be better than venturing out on his own. This way, he could definitely learn more.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Knife Grave. There might be knives of a higher-tier there,\u201d Black Steel said as he walked.\n\nSeeing Han Sen follow him, he stopped and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you looking for them by yourself? Why are you following me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take a while for things to reach the seventh round of knife rain. If I come with you, I can learn stuff from you. I will go find them by myself once we reach the seventh rain.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nBlack Steel hummed and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you might not even last seven rounds.\u201d\n\nHe might have said this, but there was no sign that Black Steel actually wanted to remove Han Sen from his presence. He was headed towards the volcano. He was headed to Knife Grave.\n\nThey walked side by side, and when they reached the volcano, Black Steel threw a knife at Han Sen. \u201cYou are lucky. This is a Baron knife for you. It is quite rare to find on the first round. With this, you should be able to last a few rounds extra.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Han Sen swung his knife. The knife was smooth to wield.\n\nBlack Steel ignored him and kept walking to the volcano. When he was half-way, he found another Baron knife.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you have an interest in knives,\u201d Han Sen said with curiosity. The knife did not have the word Baron written down on it So, amidst all the knives that were there, he couldn\u2019t distinguish one from the other. Black Steel seemed to be able to tell with just a glance. That meant he was probably pretty good.\n\nBlack Steel answered, \u201cI have practiced knife skills since I was young, and our family produces knives, anyway. So, I can determine the quality with ease.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Han Sen thought. He then said, \u201cIf you are that good, why don\u2019t we co-operate? You select a knife for me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought there were too many weapons, as they were everywhere. Finding a good quality one would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\nWith a professional, things would go much better.\n\nBlack Steel rolled his eyes and said, \u201cI help you pick and you do what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will block some of the knife rain for you,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBlack Steel lifted his lips and ignored him. He sat down on a rock and placed the knife on his leg. He closed his eyes and waited for the next round to begin."
