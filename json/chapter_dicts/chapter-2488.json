    "text": "Han Sen fell back two steps in surprise. In the center of the spider plant, there was a white fire that was like a little lantern.\n\nHan Sen looked close. In reality, it wasn\u2019t a fire; it was a halo.\n\nAt the center of the halo was a black bug that looked something like a cricket. The pitch-black insect was similar in size, and it had two swinging antennae. It climbed up the spider plant.\n\nWhen it reached the end of the spider plant, its weight pulled the lead of the plant lower. Then, the little creature opened its mouth. Its sharp teeth dug into the delicate spider plant leaf.\n\nKatcha! Katcha!\n\nIt took a little while for the cricket to eat its fill. Once it was satisfied, the cricket began to climb back down the plant.\n\nAs the insect moved, puffs of white smoke were emitted. The white smoke condensed into a creamy white cloud. Clouds rose from the creature\u2019s back, one by one, just like the creamy white cloud Han Sen had seen before.\n\nNow Han Sen knew that the clouds from the spider plant weren\u2019t actually from the plant. They came from the juices of the black cricket.\n\nThe black cricket quickly dug back into the roots of the plant and was about to disappear.\n\nHan Sen reached out and grabbed the cricket. The black cricket struggled in his hand, and it was a surprisingly strong little thing. It was no stronger than a King, though, and so it couldn\u2019t resist Han Sen.\n\nThe black cricket knew that it couldn\u2019t run. Its body discharged a white vapor that soon turned into a fluffy white cloud that wrapped around the cricket.\n\nHan Sen held onto the cloud like he was holding a big steamed bun.\n\nFortunately, as long as he moved slowly, Han Sen could still sink his hands into the creamy cloud. The cricket wouldn\u2019t escape Han Sen\u2019s grasp like this.\n\n\u201cThe cricket can\u2019t be any more powerful than a Marquise, but the cloud juice it produces is quite amazing. Not even my power can break it.\u201d After hesitating for a moment, Han Sen put the cricket inside Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nThen, he walked to the spider plant and prodded it. He tried to feel the lifeforce inside the spider plant.\n\nThe spider plant had a great deal of lifeforce, but unlike the cricket, Han Sen wasn\u2019t capable of eating it. He examined the spider plant carefully, but he didn\u2019t see anything else of note. He put the spider plant inside Destiny\u2019s Tower, as well.\n\nAfter emerging from that pocket of cloud, Han Sen thought about it some more. Then he put the entire cloud inside Destiny\u2019s Tower, too. Once that was done, he turned and flew away from there to continue searching for Bao\u2019er and the others.\n\nBut Han Sen hadn\u2019t been flying for long when he saw a bunch of cloud beasts heading toward him.\n\nThey were a flock of crane-like creatures. There had to be at least a thousand of them. Most of them were Marquises, but there were some Dukes as well. The leader was the King, and it had a King area.\n\nHan Sen was actually rather happy when they appeared. He pulled out his knife and dove into the flock. The cloud beasts were xenogeneics, after all. Killing another King class xenogeneic would help Han Sen fill up his King class genes.\n\nHan Sen had four different geno arts. Each time he leveled one up, it required one hundred genes. When all those requirements were added up, it became a substantial number of genes that he needed. He had to collect as many as he could, whenever he was able to.\n\nThe cloud beasts didn\u2019t stand a chance against Han Sen. When he reached them, he cut the King\u2019s head clean off.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Cloud Crane King. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen casually pulled out the xenogeneic gene from the Cloud Crane King\u2019s body. He expected the rest of the cloud cranes to disperse after the King was killed, but they all came after him without any fear of death. It was like they wanted to avenge the slaying of the Cloud Crane King, even if it meant sacrificing their lives.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t interested in spending the time to kill those low-class cloud beasts, though. He flew away at full speed. The low-level cloud cranes weren\u2019t able to keep up, so it wasn\u2019t long before they lost Han Sen completely.\n\nBut just as Han Sen escaped, he saw another group of cloud beasts approaching. These looked like tigers, and there were a few Kings in their midst.\n\n\u201cHaha! My luck is good today!\u201d Han Sen thought with a grin. He grabbed his Ghost Teeth Knife and flew to meet them.\n\nHan Sen swooped down among the tigers like a beautiful butterfly. The Ghost Teeth Knife he wielded danced like the fangs of a devil, and he killed the cloud tigers one by one.\n\nThey were King class xenogeneics with second or third-tier King areas. Han Sen only needed one attack to kill each one.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Cloud Tiger. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Cloud Tiger beast soul.\u201d\n\nHan Sen killed five of the King class tigers, and he managed to earn one Cloud Tiger beast soul. Han Sen felt pretty good about that.\n\nThere were many cloud beasts all across the Tianxia System, but finding a King class wasn\u2019t always easy. And shortly after taking down one King, Han Sen had found several more. He was lucky.\n\nThe remaining Cloud Tigers ran after Han Sen, but he ignored them and continued to fly.\n\nHan Sen had been flying for a while when he met another group of cloud beasts, but this time, there weren\u2019t any Kings among them. The leader of those beasts was just Duke class.\n\nHan Sen thought a punch might be enough to scare them off, but this theory soon proved false. Han Sen punched a dozen of the cloud beasts, but they just continued to come.\n\nHan Sen shook them off his tail and kept on flying, but he started to realize that something was amiss. He seemed to be encountering cloud beasts no matter which direction he decided to go.\n\nAnd the cloud beasts were all so angry, too. None of them were afraid to die. They came at him like he was their mortal enemy, and no matter how many of them he killed, none of the cloud beasts were willing to back down.\n\n\u201cThis sea of clouds seems a little bit cursed.\u201d Han Sen frowned in thought. He decided to head in a different direction, wanting to see if he would encounter any more cloud beasts.\n\nThe result was the same, and again, he met another large group of cloud beasts.\n\nHan Sen changed direction a few times, but he encountered groups of cloud beasts every time. But all of those cloud beasts had red eyes. They leaped for him ravenously whenever they saw him, even if they didn\u2019t stand a chance of harming him.\n\n\u201cThis is getting really weird.\u201d Although Han Sen had killed many King class cloud beasts, he couldn\u2019t really enjoy his success. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, and that made him uncomfortable.\n\nHan Sen could kill any King class cloud beast he met. But the Tianxia System was known for its deified xenogeneics. If he encountered a deified monster among the hordes of normal xenogeneics, he would be in for another brutal fight.\n\nAfter pausing for a while, Han Sen flew back the way he had come. The first thing he needed to do was to get away from that sea of creamy clouds. The place was creepy, and the creatures were far too hostile. He didn\u2019t feel comfortable being there.\n\nOn his way back, he encountered the groups of creatures that he had fought before. All their eyes seemed red, and they obviously wanted to avenge the deaths of their Kings. So, they all chased Han Sen.\n\nThis time, it looked a little while for Han Sen to shake off their pursuit. Before long, he escaped the creamy sea of clouds and returned to the light blue sea of clouds.\n\n\u201cI finally got away from that cursed sea of clouds.\u201d Han Sen felt relief. But before he could completely relax, he saw a shadow headed his way. It was the Extreme King deified, Meng Lie."
