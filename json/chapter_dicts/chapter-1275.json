And now, after this latest kill, he had also gotten a berserk beast soul. While he could always create his own, earning one and not having to wait out the evolution process was a brilliant thing.\n\nThe Serpent Throne was a super creature with ten gene locks open, so there was no doubt in Han Sen\u2019s mind that it would be a magnificent beast to have at his disposal.\n\nHan Sen looked into his Sea of Soul to get a look at its type.\n\n\u201cI have armor and weapons already. This looks like a mount more than anything. But I don\u2019t really want a mount. If it is a shapeshift beast soul, I don\u2019t want to shapeshift into a chair, either. Plus, I have my Gold Raven and Ancient Devil Soldier beast souls for whenever I wish to shapeshift,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBerserk Super Beast Soul Serpent Throne: Doll Type\n\n\u201cDoll type? What is that?! I don\u2019t need an action figure,\u201d Han Sen was surprised, to say the least.\n\nHan Sen had discovered a lot of unique beast souls during his time in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and the Alliance always rewarded the finders of new beast soul discoveries. That being said, Han Sen had not reported any of his findings. He had enough money as it was, so it was simple laziness that was prohibiting him from making the reports.\n\nHan Sen put Qin Xuan on the fish king and went downstream.\n\nHan Sen really appreciated the assistance of the fish king. If it hadn\u2019t shown up, even with Little Angel, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have been able to buy the time necessary to build up the moves that brought an end to the fighting.\n\nHan Sen was going to call this new hyper geno art, that used space and time elements together, \u201cGhost Slash.\u201d\n\nWhile the name did not bear any semblance to the space and time elements that fueled it, it was a name he had carefully selected due to the meanings that resided below the surface.\n\nBefore humans entered their interstellar era, they could not interact, bend, or meld the actual elements of space and time. There were a number of ships, however, that disappeared and reappeared a few decades later. They were dubbed \u201cghost ships\u201d due to having unwittingly stumbled through wormholes and traveled through time. What seemed like seconds of travel to those onboard had actually been years for everyone else.\n\nThe Ghost Slash Han Sen had formulated was similar, as it rapidly redefined and reduced the breadth of time when performed.\n\nIt made the time and distance his attack had to travel next to nothing. While the opponent could see his attack appear like normal, they were completely oblivious to what he was actually doing.\n\nThe space and time Han Sen operated in, during those brief moments of attack, were different. His attack was impossible to block.\n\nThe empress was stronger than Han Sen, there was no doubt about that. Ghost Slash should have been able to injure her, but not kill her.\n\nBut Ghost Slash ignored the general rules of space and time. She was going to stab Han Sen with her spear, so, being unable to dodge, she had completely opened herself up and made herself susceptible to a one-hit-kill.\n\nSeeing this, it drove a fear into Serpent Throne\u2019s heart that made it flee. This also made it drop its guard, allowing Han Sen to one-hit-kill it, as well.\n\nAnd of course, it was Han Sen\u2019s combining with Little Angel that upped his strength enough to deliver the power required to achieve the two kills.\n\nHan Sen was happy with Ghost Slash, though. It wasn\u2019t what he believed it would be, but due to its unstoppability, he liked it a lot.\n\nThe fish king took the three of them to a nearby shelter, then Han Sen led Qin Xuan back to Thunder Hell Shelter. There were still six Aqua Fruits back on the vine, but none had dared take them. And Han Sen, in the meantime, was simply glad he had managed to obtain two.\n\nQin Xuan was shocked upon her arrival at the shelter. She couldn\u2019t believe all the king spirits and super creatures that occupied the place, each in service of Han Sen.\n\nQin Xuan was not surprised Han Sen had managed to obtain a number of super beast souls, but she had believed it to be impossible for him to make super creatures and king spirits willingly obey him.\n\nQin Xuan had learned Queen was still traveling with Han Sen, and she wished to meet with her, but when they arrived, Queen was out hunting. Han Sen got all the meat Queen would ever need for her, but she still insisted on hunting by herself to hone her talents.\n\nOnce Han Sen had recovered from his state of weariness, he was planning on returning to Blood River Shelter and conquering the place. That was still unfinished business.\n\nBlood River King had just lost three super creatures, so Han Sen thought he wouldn\u2019t have too much trouble taking it down with just Little Angel and Disloyal Knight by his side.\n\nHan Sen went to his room and summoned Moment Queen.\n\n\u201cAre you enjoying life inside the Cruel Bottle?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen knew what he had actually summoned her for, and so she said, \u201cMaybe now I can finish what I was trying to tell you. That which is embedded inside the king spirit\u2019s head is the core of an Aqua Fruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen said, \u201cAmong the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary\u2019s emperor-class plants, Aqua Fruit is undoubtedly in the top ten. They can allow emperors to open gene locks. If they have ten gene locks open already, the fruit can allow them to open the Holy Door.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut spirits don\u2019t really know what it does. And they don\u2019t know that the fruit itself can only be used to open a few lower-level gene locks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpirits? Are you trying to tell me you aren\u2019t an ordinary king spirit?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nThe empress had been tricked by God\u2019s Retribution. Three cores had been obtained in total. One had been taken by the blue-blooded man, while two had been retrieved by Han Sen.\n\nMoment Queen sighed and said, \u201cIt is pointless if you learn more about me. Just\u2026 tell me what I must do to earn back my freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t quite confirm the validity of what you have told me just yet,\u201d Han Sen said."
