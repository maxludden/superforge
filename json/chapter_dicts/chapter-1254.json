It was filled to the brim with an alcohol that looked like warm, red wine. The jue was submerged in the water of the pot, but the water did not mix with the red concoction inside the jue. It remained separate.\n\nHan Sen had initially wanted to eat the egg, but he did not expect that this would emerge from it. The jue did not have a lifeforce, and it was more akin to a physical item than a creature.\n\nHan Sen stared at it. All he knew was that it was a goblet or vessel for pouring alcohol, and that some people said it could be used for rituals of sorts. Aside from that, Han Sen didn\u2019t know much about what it was, exactly. It looked like an ancient jue, from time immemorial, due to it being perched on a small tripod.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t believe it that the egg had contained a jue.\n\nIt didn\u2019t move while in the pot. It remained where it was like an inanimate object, as the water around it continued to boil and vaporize.\n\nNot long after, the last of the water boiled off. The red liquid remained where it was in the jue, having not been disturbed by the water one bit. No matter how hot it had gotten, or how wild the water of the pot had bubbled, the substance inside was fine.\n\nThe pot was now completely dry, and the jue remained exactly the same as it had been.\n\nHan Sen gave the alcohol inside the jue a good sniff, and he was taken aback by how pleasant its fragrance was. He wasn\u2019t much of a drinker, but he most certainly wanted to partake in that drink.\n\nThe jue creeped him out, though. And he wasn\u2019t so silly as to start drinking without knowing any better.\n\nBao\u2019er was different, however. She had finally shown some interest in the contents of the egg, and after crawling over to the jue, she reached in and grabbed it.\n\n\u201cCareful.\u201d Han Sen still didn\u2019t know what was inside the jue, and if the beverage inside was poison, it would be a poor decision to drink it.\n\nHan Sen wanted to take the jue away from Bao\u2019er, just in case, but before he could reach for it, she drank it all.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, are you okay?\u201d Han Sen asked with concern, finally pulling the jue away from her.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s face looked red and flushed, as if she was drunk.\n\nHan Sen examined her a little closer. She was indeed drunk, but that aside, she did not look at all harmed. The contents of the jue seemed to have caused no damage.\n\nHan Sen held the jue in front of him, waiting for it to move or at least do something. Unfortunately, nothing occurred.\n\nThe pot was burning hot, being atop the fire for so long, but the jue was surprisingly cool to the touch.\n\n\u201cIt has no lifeforce, and it isn\u2019t aggressive. It doesn\u2019t do anything. Did this thing really come out of that egg?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t imagine a Mama or Papa Jue producing Baby Jue eggs.\n\nBut still, there was a prevailing absence of danger. Bao\u2019er continued to appear unaffected and just went to sleep, drunk.\n\nShe didn\u2019t wake up until half a day later.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked to the jue that was still in Han Sen\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI want more of that drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sort of drink is reserved only for adults. Children can\u2019t drink alcohol,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\nIt seemed as if the alcohol had special properties he himself was keen to explore. He was indeed quite curious regarding its origins.\n\nHan Sen remained there for many days, watching the jue intently. He wasn\u2019t missing anything, though, as he had repeatedly checked on the whereabouts of Yaksha and Blood River King. They were still inside Blood River Shelter.\n\nThree days later, Han Sen\u2019s curiosity got the better of him. He grabbed a bottle of alcohol and poured it into the jue. The alcohol originally looked white, but it turned the sickly color of blood upon entering.\n\nThe jue smelled so very strong, and the scent was heavier than any white wine he had ever known. It prompted Han Sen\u2019s saliva to go renegade.\n\nBao\u2019er tried her best to grab the jue that was held out of the reach of her arms, so Han Sen pulled her by the clothes and lifted her up.\n\nAs Bao\u2019er was in the air, her arms flailed in the direction of the jue. She was desperate for more.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a kid. Let me drink it first.\u201d Han Sen picked up the jue.\n\nHan Sen enjoyed another hearty waft of its fragrance, loving it. Han Sen now knew the red wine was not harmful, so he had no qualms with drinking it.\n\nHan Sen felt a sensational warmth descend his throat. The pores on his skin felt rejuvenated, as if he had just stepped out of a hot spring.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice drink.\u201d Han Sen did not know much about alcohol, but he knew this was a belter. Han Sen licked his lips, having enjoyed every last drop.\n\nAs Han Sen reflected on the mesmerizing flavor he had just experienced, an announcement suddenly played.\n\n\u201cThe sacrificial wine has been consumed. The sacrificial ritual now begins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Han Sen noticed his body begin to flare up with a red color.\n\nHe saw an array of symbols get etched across his body, not too unlike the jue. Then, the entire cave turned red. Han Sen did not know why nothing occurred when Bao\u2019er drank it, but something bad seemed to be happening with him.\n\nAnd amidst all this, he looked at Bao\u2019er who was still in his arms and noticed how she was still perfectly fine.\n\nBoom!\n\nMost of Han Sen\u2019s body was set ablaze as the red symbols branded themselves across his skin."
