    "text": "Han Sen was very curious about that sword light rain. Although people said King Bai had destroyed the sword light, Han Sen didn\u2019t think the reality of what had happened was quite that simple.\n\nHan Sen summoned the Siren Virgin so that she could take a look at the sword light rain. He also told her about the sword light that had appeared atop Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s peak. He didn\u2019t reveal that he was the one who had destroyed the knoll atop that mountain, however.\n\nWhen the Siren Virgin heard what he had to say, she looked startled. She silently turned to observe the sword light rain.\n\n\u201cDo you know what this sword light is?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown. The Siren Virgin had been silent for a long, thoughtful minute.\n\nThen she looked back at him and said, \u201cMad Sword. For a long time, even talking about him was considered taboo among the Extreme King. He wasn\u2019t one of the Extreme King\u2019s nobility, and he didn\u2019t even have a king body. But his sword skills were beyond talented. He was just a normal swordsman, and yet, he became deified. He beat countless elites of the Extreme King.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHave you wondered about why a scary elite like this was never really made famous outside of the Extreme King?\u201d the Siren Virgin asked.\n\n\u201cI have given that some thought, and I think it is pretty weird. It doesn\u2019t really make any sense. My best guess is that the Extreme King trapped him here. He was never allowed to go beyond the borders of the Extreme King\u2019s domain,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThe Siren Virgin shook her head. \u201cYou have guessed half of it correctly. Mad Sword never left the Extreme King. He actually was famous among outside races, but they knew him by a different name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, Mad Sword used an alias in his exploits across the universe? Why would he do such a thing?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\nThe Siren Virgin shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I investigated Mad Sword, but I only learned that he did something that made the Extreme King despise him. Many people in the Extreme King severely dislike him.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the Siren Virgin looked at the sword light rain like she was looking out to sea. She said, \u201cIf I am correct, it\u2019s possible that Mad Sword isn\u2019t completely dead. This sword light rain might suggest that he may be reborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, Mad Sword was trapped in the \u201cPride and bones are made\u201d stone? That sword light was Mad Sword himself?\u201d Han Sen asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIt was probably just his will. I bet King Bai has a pretty nasty headache right about now. If that guy is reborn, the Extreme King will descend into chaos. That\u2019s good. The more chaos, the more benefits you and I can reap,\u201d the Siren Virgin said. She ended with a laugh.\n\n\u201cIf Mad Sword only left his will behind, then he might have decided to escape the region entirely once he was freed. That wouldn\u2019t shake up the Extreme King society very much at all,\u201d Han Sen said, disagreeing with the Siren Virgin.\n\nThe Siren Virgin shook her head. \u201cWhy would he run? Right now, here in the realm of the Extreme King, the sword light is everywhere. All he needs to do is attach to some creature here and possess it. Any effort the Extreme King make to find him will probably turn out to be impossible. There is no need for him to run.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing the Siren Virgin say this, Han Sen felt his heart jump. After a long moment, he asked, \u201cMight Mad Sword seek to choose me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many people in the Extreme King. Mad Sword doesn\u2019t require someone talented, so there\u2019s no reason for him to go after a prince. You think too much,\u201d the Siren Virgin said.\n\nDespite her reassurance, Han Sen did not feel safe. It made him worry quite a bit.\n\nLuckily, when the sword light rain stopped, nothing weird had occurred in Planet Water Zone. However, Han Sen was paranoid for the duration of the rain.\n\nDue to the sword light rain, the next part of the exam was delayed seven days. The passion for the event had slowly withered away. Perhaps it was due to the sword light rain incident, but the Extreme King\u2019s supervisors weren\u2019t very focused on the exams. And although the sword light rain had stopped, the exams remained on pause.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of King\u2019s Kingdom was tense. The realm was placed on lockdown, and even Han Sen\u2019s Planet Water Zone was investigated by a number of different departments.\n\nThe workers might not have known what they were looking for, but Han Sen figured that the Extreme King\u2019s supervisor was still searching for Mad Sword\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cWhat a scary guy. He only had his will left, but even so, its reappearance has caused this much of a ruckus. I could die a happy man if I was that influential.\u201d Han Sen sighed after sending away a few more officers.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t travel anywhere. He focused on leveling up his Dongxuan Sutra. He wanted to get that to King class as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra were easier for him to level up, Han Sen still wanted the Dongxuan Sutra to be leveled up first. Han Sen sensed that a crisis was near, and the Dongxuan Sutra was the skill he was most familiar with. It was something he could rely on.\n\nThe Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s power was irreplaceable. No other geno art could match its offensive capabilities. In a proper fight, Han Sen could fight without Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and even The Story of Genes. Doing so never really affected Han Sen\u2019s fighting power.\n\nBut without the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen\u2019s fighting power was noticeably decreased.\n\nThe other three geno arts were plenty strong, but the Dongxuan Sutra was the most compatible with who Han Sen was as a person. It matched his personality. That was the primary reason that Han Sen always fell back on the Dongxuan Sutra. It was simply comfortable.\n\nA crisis was brewing, and he had promised aid to Ning Yue, as well. He needed to gain more power, and he needed to do so quickly. The most straightforward way to achieve this was to take the Dongxuan Sutra to King class.\n\nHan Sen practiced in the training room for an entire month, using the Dongxuan Sutra the entire time. His whole body felt like part of a machine.\n\nYes, it was a machine.\n\nFrom Han Sen\u2019s point of view, the Dongxuan body made the entire universe seem like one giant machine. Grass, forests, stone, water, bugs, fish; they were all gears inside this machine.\n\nEach cogwheel was a different size and shape, but they all fit together. They all connected to each other. When one cog spun, it spun the cog next to it. And that new one that spun would spin the next cog, and so on.\n\nHan Sen was just a single piece amidst an unfathomably vast machine. With the power of the Dongxuan Sutra, however, Han Sen had a wider view of the cogs and how each one related to the others.\n\nUsing the geno art felt amazing. Two objects in the real world might have no visible connection, but Han Sen could see the power that was transferred between them. The only thing Han Sen didn\u2019t know was exactly how he could affect those relationships.\n\nHan Sen understood that if he was to alter the power-exchange of the cogs, he would require King area powers.\n\nEvery King area affected the way the cogs were spun. A King area could make them go faster or slower, or even spin in reverse. All the rules of nearby cogwheels were affected, creating special area pockets.\n\nHan Sen had been trying to push his own cogwheel and alter the way it spun, but he couldn\u2019t get it to work. He couldn\u2019t affect the mechanism that controlled the entire universe, and thereby create a new King area."
