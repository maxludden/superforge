    "text": "Han Sen was a little bit curious. He sat down near where the Underworld Silk disappeared into the clouds, and he decided to wait and see what happened.\n\nBut after he waited for a whole hour, the Underworld Silk hadn\u2019t moved an inch. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was working or not.\n\n\u201cExquisite isn\u2019t trying to test my patience, is she?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself. And then, he looked at Bao\u2019er and said, \u201cBao\u2019er, do you fancy doing some fishing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I would like to,\u201d Bao\u2019er said with a nod.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will give it to you.\u201d Han Sen handed over his Underworld Silk.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad. I\u2019m going to catch some super big fish for you,\u201d Bao\u2019er said. She had wanted to try fishing a long time ago, and now Han Sen was making good on a long-awaited promise.\n\n\u201cSure you will,\u201d Han Sen said encouragingly, not wanting to crush her hopes. But inside, he was thinking, \u201cThere is no hook and no bait. You won\u2019t be able to pull anything out of this lake. Do you really think you are Jiang Tai Gong, who can fish with nothing but a rod and line?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er had a stern and serious look on her face while she fished. Han Sen, in the meantime, began to flip through the text for Very Real Body.\n\nThe knife skills and punching techniques were good. They were top-dog geno arts for sure, but Han Sen\u2019s knife skills and boxing talents were already high class. He only needed to briefly glance over the skills that Exquisite had brought him. There was no point in practicing them with any modicum of seriousness.\n\nHan Sen had already trained in the use of God\u2019s Wander. He just needed to slowly reveal his proficiency with it to Exquisite.\n\nHan Sen thought the Very Real Body was extremely interesting, however. It was a skill that could reinforce his body, and at the same time, it could make his body into a weapon.\n\nVery Real Body had a high requirement for the practitioner\u2019s base-level strength, though. Even ordinary deifieds might not have the requisite physical power for the beginner level of Very Real Body. Han Sen, on the other hand, had a body that was stronger than any half-deified. The power granted by his four geno arts wasn\u2019t something ordinary creatures could match. So, fulfilling the requirements for Very Real Body wasn\u2019t too difficult for him.\n\nIn fact, this was the reason that Exquisite had given him Very Real Body.\n\n\u201cAn extreme body works as a blade. Once I learn this geno art, I should be able to fight others of the same level, even if they\u2019re making use of a xenogeneic weapon. That is pretty cool.\u201d After Han Sen read through it once, he began to practice Very Real Body.\n\nBut it would take a very long time for Han Sen to practice and become talented with this geno art. This wasn\u2019t a task that he could accomplish in a day, and so Han Sen wasn\u2019t in a crazy rush. He trained slowly, and he also practiced Heart Connection in the meantime.\n\nHan Sen set the small jade figure into a fishing mode. Even if Exquisite turned her attention back to him, she would only sense him fishing. She wouldn\u2019t realize that it was Bao\u2019er doing the fishing for him.\n\nBao\u2019er was still as serious about fishing as when she had begun. Han Sen was surprised. He didn\u2019t expect that the normally rambunctious Bao\u2019er would be content to spend time with the slow, patience-testing, quiet art of fishing.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame\u2026 This fishing line seems entirely useless.\u201d Han Sen thought Exquisite really was testing his patience. There was no way they would be reeling anything in.\n\n\u201cDad! Dad! There is something on my line!\u201d Bao\u2019er suddenly shouted with glee. She held onto the Underworld Silk for dear life with those little hands of hers.\n\n\u201cNo way. You\u2019ve actually caught something?\u201d Han Sen quickly looked at the Underworld Lake. He saw that the lake\u2019s mist was swirling around the Underworld Silk. The mist had grown more cloudy, as if there really was something down there moving about.\n\n\u201cPull the line! Pull the line!\u201d Han Sen ran behind Bao\u2019er and started reeling the Underworld Silk back with her.\n\nWhatever was on the other end was quite heavy, and Han Sen was worried that the Underworld Silk might break. Fortunately, his worries didn\u2019t come to pass. The Underworld Silk remained undamaged as the two of them hauled it out.\n\nAs more and more of the lake\u2019s mist was disturbed by the rising object, their excitement grew as well.\n\n\u201cHurry up! Hurry up! We might have caught something big\u2026\u201d Han Sen was happily shouting.\n\n\u201cI want to eat grilled fish tonight,\u201d Bao\u2019er said. She licked her lips as her eyes became incredibly bright.\n\nThe Underworld Silk was getting longer and longer. Han Sen had no idea how deep the line had gone. He just kept pulling it in, hand over hand.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen and Bao\u2019er felt as if something on the other end of the line had torn loose. The line snapped back toward them like a broken rubber band. The two of them had been pulling their hardest when they were suddenly sent rocketing back into the ground. Bao\u2019er shot into Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\nAnd then, the two of them saw something emerge from the lake with the Underworld Silk. It arced beautifully through the air overhead, then landed next to them with a ringing noise.\n\nThe two of them turned their heads quickly. They saw a giant gold sword sticking out of the ground, every inch of it gleaming in the light.\n\n\u201cHoly crap! Aren\u2019t we fishing? Why did we just reel in a giant sword?\u201d Han Sen looked at the giant, luxurious sword with shock.\n\nThe enormous sword gave Han Sen the feeling he was looking at something owned by a rich person. The whole thing had been made of gold, and it looked incredibly heavy. It was about 1.5 meters long, and the blade was one foot wide. It looked like a small door.\n\nThere were some engravings carved into the sword. There was the depiction of a phoenix, and there were jewels embedded in the metal. The sword looked very luxurious, especially the center of the handle, which held a fist-sized, gold jewel.\n\nHan Sen had seen a lot of weapons in his time, but he had never seen a weapon that looked so opulent.\n\n\u201cHow can you fish up something like this?\u201d Han Sen mumbled as he stood up. He walked in front of the big gold sword. He reached for the handle to see what sort of weapon it was.\n\nPang!\n\nJust as Han Sen\u2019s hand touched the pommel, the brilliant gold sword shone brightly. Han Sen felt as if an electric current was coursing through him. His entire body was hurled through the air. He rolled for one hundred meters before coming to a stop.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026 It\u2019s a deified treasure\u2026\u201d Han Sen lifted himself off the ground. His whole body was covered in ash, and blood dripped from his mouth. He looked happy, though.\n\nDespite his remarkable fitness, the blade had still been able to toss him away and deal that much damage with a single touch. It was definitely a deified treasure. Any item of a lesser rank couldn\u2019t possess that much power.\u201cYou can fish up deified treasure from here? Seriously?\u201d Han Sen ran back to the luxurious sword. He still couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.\n\nHan Sen stared at the gleaming sword, and he finally accepted that Exquisite hadn\u2019t just been testing his patience. There really were powerful treasures that could be pulled from this lake.\n\nEvidently, some of them were even deified.\n\n\u201cNo wonder the Very High are so strong. Deified treasures can be pulled from this lake. This cannot be real, surely.\u201d Han Sen felt as if his heart was going to leap out of his chest. It had taken them half a day to obtain this deified treasure. If they fished there for a few months, they would be blinged up in all sorts of deified kit.\n\nBut when Han Sen went to take hold of the gold sword again, the luxurious weapon bounced him away again. Han Sen used all his power to try and hold it, but alas, he could not.\n\nHowever, when Bao\u2019er touched it, the beautiful gold sword seemed to rest comfortably in her hands. And it even became smaller. It shrank until it seemed perfectly suited to her diminutive size.\n\n\u201cThis cannot only be used by the person who fished it up, surely.\u201d After Han Sen thought of this, he threw his Underworld Silk into the lake again. He watched the Underworld Lake and thought, \u201cCome on, baby. Give me a big gold sword, too. I don\u2019t mind if it makes me look rich.\u201d"
