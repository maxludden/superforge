She looked at the information on the screen, locked in deep thought.\n\nAll the documents pertained to Han Sen. It was everything that had been recorded of him since the fight when Kong Fei had snuffed out and relit a lantern. It informed her of everything he did, all the way up until he disguised himself as Bai Yi. The records of it were all there.\n\n\u201cSuch a scary guy. These records make his life look like he\u2019s playing with cheat codes. He has done way too many unbelievable things. It is difficult to imagine that a leftover crystallizer, starting from scratch, achieved all that he has today.\u201d The investigation was very thorough. Miss Mirror had to admit that if she had been in the same situation as Han Sen, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve half of what Han Sen had managed to.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that he isn\u2019t really Bai Yi. Otherwise, with his performance amongst the Extreme King, he might have become a legendary figure for us.\u201d Miss Mirror sighed. She turned off the computer and rubbed her temples.\n\nShe had been tired for a while. The person who had her Mirror Spirit Eye Ring was disguising himself as a prince. It made things rather difficult for her. She couldn\u2019t tell King Bai about it, but neither could she lie to him. And King Bai wasn\u2019t an easy man to fool. Lying to him might lead her down a path she could never return from.\n\n\u201cRadiowave should be investigating Han Sen. If they start uncovering his secrets too quickly, things might go badly for me. And if I had Han Sen over, I\u2019m afraid the Mirror Spirit Eye won\u2019t be able to withstand the same dosage of damage again.\u201d Miss Mirror was beginning to develop a headache.\n\nMiss Mirror closed her eyes to think, but she couldn\u2019t figure out a solution that was perfect for her.\n\nA subordinate knocked at her door. \u201cMiss Mirror, the location of the seven-five-six-eight God Battle Ruin has been confirmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the information.\u201d Miss Mirror sat up straight, looking like a lady again.\n\nThe subordinate pushed open the door and set the documents down in front of her. Miss Mirror examined them for a while and frowned. She said, \u201cAnother race has been found? At Ruin 7568?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my lady. Our people found a big excavation site, and some construction zones started up not too long ago,\u201d the subordinate explained.\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s all for now.\u201d Miss Mirror set the documents back down on the table. She closed her eyes and thought.\n\nA while later, she opened her eyes. She glanced over the pages again, then finally smiled. She said out loud, \u201cRuin 7568\u2026 If that is the one, perhaps I can convince my brother. I can take Han Sen there. This is an opportunity.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFor the first time in a while, things were going smoothly. Han Sen had the small furnace to show him the way, and he had collected many core xenogeneic genes. Now, he was holding four. He ate two and tossed the others to the furnace.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because Han Sen was a waster. It was just because he couldn\u2019t digest them. Even with Consume\u2019s help, he could only eat two a day. If he wanted to gain one hundred King class genes, it would take more than a month.\n\nBecause the small furnace behaved well, Han Sen gave it a few core xenogeneic genes whenever he could. The small furnace was always delighted to receive them.\n\nSwords from the Furnace required core xenogeneic genes for production. But core genes from different xenogeneics could create different swords inside the furnace.\n\n\u201cNo wonder that big furnace was so strong. All the swords it produced came from King xenogeneic genes. I can\u2019t even guess how many King class core xenogeneics it managed to kill in its time. Too bad the xenogeneic genes are melted down inside the furnace. If a furnace is destroyed, the swords are also destroyed. Otherwise, I\u2019d have received enough xenogeneic genes to last me many lives over,\u201d Han Sen thought with regret.\n\nThe small furnace followed Han Sen and collected a few treats on the way. When Han Sen left the core area, it didn\u2019t run off. It waited for Han Sen to come back.\n\nA few days later, the small furnace was forging a few sword blanks.\n\nHan Sen thought this relaxed schedule would last for some time, but when Miss Mirror showed up, she destroyed his delusions of just enjoying life for a while.\n\n\u201cPack your stuff, you have a mission to go on,\u201d Miss Mirror said before taking a sip of tea.\n\n\u201cWhat mission?\u201d Han Sen asked with trepidation. Miss Mirror had asked him to pack, so that meant he was leaving King\u2019s Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThis is your father\u2019s handwriting. Is there a problem?\u201d Miss Mirror asked, setting a note down on the table as she spoke.\n\n\u201cYes. Can I bring my subordinates with me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI suppose you can, but are you sure about taking them someplace dangerous?\u201d Miss Mirror looked like she was smiling, but she wasn\u2019t.\n\nHan Sen knew Miss Mirror was referring to Bao\u2019er. She was warning Han Sen not to attempt an escape. He wouldn\u2019t have a chance to.\n\n\u201cIf I can, I would like to bring Bao\u2019er,\u201d Han Sen said, pretending not to know what she meant.\n\n\u201cSure, but I have already told you; this place is dangerous. If something happens, don\u2019t blame your auntie for not warning you,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cI will be responsible for this decision,\u201d Han Sen said tonelessly.\n\n\u201cGood. Go and prepare. We will be leaving tonight.\u201d With that, Miss Mirror turned and promptly left Underwater Town.\n\nHan Sen called for Bao\u2019er. He left the Blood Kirin behind in Underwater Town to look after Lan Haixin, just in case she decided to stir up trouble.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t planning an escape. The Extreme King were too powerful. Unless he had a reliable backup plan, he wouldn\u2019t flee. He couldn\u2019t go back to Planet Eclipse, either. He didn\u2019t want to drag Yisha into his problematic affairs.\n\nHan Sen wanted to bring Bao\u2019er because he didn\u2019t feel safe leaving her alone. Plus, he was used to having Bao\u2019er around. Whenever he was alone, it always felt like he was missing something.\n\nHe asked the Blood Kirin to watch Lan Haixin. Lilly begged Han Sen to take her with him, but he refused.\n\nMiss Mirror had said that the place was dangerous, and Han Sen didn\u2019t think she told him that just to scare him. He was bringing Bao\u2019er along because she could protect herself. Lilly was just a Duke. She would be unable to protect herself, and bringing her would be like handing her a death sentence.\n\nHe brought Bao\u2019er to the rally point, knowing that they wouldn\u2019t be going alone. Many members of Spring Rain had already gathered. There were many Kings and half-deifieds, and Han Sen even saw two fully deified warriors amongst them.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d Han Sen wondered. This was enough combat power to annihilate a higher race.\n\nWhen the ship started to move, Miss Mirror didn\u2019t come looking for him. Han Sen had free time, so he practiced and consumed King class genes.\n\nHan Sen started trying to push Jadeskin\u2019s self-universe cogwheel. He wanted to get Jadeskin up to King class. That progress would be much easier than leveling up the Dongxuan Sutra. It would only be a matter of time.\n\nThe ship flew through many space teleportation points. When the ship arrived at their ultimate destination, Han Sen was shocked. He knew the place.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this the xenogeneic space that Ning Yue mentioned?\u201d Han Sen wondered."
