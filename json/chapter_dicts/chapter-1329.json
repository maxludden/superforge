But he wasn\u2019t going to fight Han Sen\u2019s companions; he was going to assist Ruin Emperor in his duel instead.\n\nNo God Emperor had come to understand Han Sen was a far greater threat to the spirits in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary than Godslayer Luo had ever been. And he believed him to be far worse than the girl who appeared to be Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir, who was currently doing battle with the Cup Demons.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s powers of time and space were still trapped by Ruin Emperor. So, No God Emperor no longer had to be afraid of a sudden kill by his fearsome Ghost Slash.\n\nDong!\n\nHan Sen used his arms swiftly and effectively to block a surprise attack delivered by the No God Sword. His jade-like arm was delivered a fair scratch.\n\nRuin Emperor threw a punch towards Han Sen\u2019s belly. After deflecting the No God Sword, Han Sen had a short window to execute a dodge. He did so without worry.\n\nHe was exemplary, and if anything, No God Emperor\u2019s decision to help out only made the situation more embarrassing for the spirits. Han Sen was able to deal with the two of them together just fine.\n\nThe spirits were all frozen, watching this. They each welled-up with a mixture of different emotions. No God Emperor and Ruin Emperor, despite working together, were unable to defeat the human emperor. It was a human; it should have been a one-and-done affair.\n\n\u201cThat is one powerful human.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor and No God Emperor can\u2019t kill the guy when working together? Is this for real, man? Is that even a human, man? What\u2019s going on, man?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible for humans to achieve such power. Since when have they been able to reach such lofty heights of might?\u201d\n\nThe spirits could hardly believe what their eyes were telling them, and it began to change their perception of humans. They weren\u2019t weak if they were given the opportunity to prove themselves and grow.\n\nAnd in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, up until now, weak humans were all they ever saw. And seeing such weakness prompted them to keep them down through brutality and slavery.\n\nOnly a few humans had what it took to take on a royal spirit. And fewer still could take on a king class.\n\nHan Sen was now battling with Ruin Emperor and No God Emperor, two of the strongest spirits in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, simultaneously. And what\u2019s more, he was showing no sign of losing.\n\n\u201cOh my days! You\u2019re telling me that pretty boy over there is a human?\u201d Flower Empress exclaimed, almost smitten by the man.\n\n\u201cAlthough most humans are weak, there is the occasional smattering of strong ones. And more often than not, they can be the falling of small stones that start an avalanche,\u201d East Empress said.\n\n\u201cHave you met or seen any of these other strong humans? What about Godslayer Luo?\u201d Heavenly Empress asked.\n\nEast Empress told her, \u201cNo, not Godslayer Luo. There was one I knew, but that was a century ago. That human was able to kill Dark Ghost Beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cA human killed Dark Ghost Beast?\u201d Heavenly Empress and Flower Empress were both shocked, both obviously familiar with the name Dark Ghost Beast. It was a berserk super creature that had opened ten gene locks. The beast was almost as strong as No God Emperor.\n\n\u201cThe human dominated the creature\u2026\u201d East Empress said this and trailed off, as if she was plummeting back into a fond reverie of days long gone by.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of human was he?\u201d Flower Empress asked.\n\nEast Empress responded to her, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. And I\u2019m even less sure of what happened to him or where he went. I recall his name to be God\u2019s Retribution.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wouldn\u2019t be surprised hearing this, for he had encountered him before. He was a member of Blood Legion, with blue blood. It was no surprise, with the strength he demonstrated, that he would be able to kill berserk super creatures.\n\nFlower Empress did not know who he was, though. And so she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the only person who might actually be able to defeat Han Sen would be The King.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we saw him, and I can only suppose he\u2019d be calling himself The Emperor by now. I\u2019m not sure if he has opened ten gene locks. But he did grow in strength very fast, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he had,\u201d Heavenly Empress said.\n\n\u201cYes, where did he go? I bet you he could beat this Han Sen! I still owe him kisses, too\u2026\u201d Flower Empress said, while spinning on her toes.\n\nHan Sen continued to battle Ruin Emperor and No God Emperor. He realized, as the fight progressed, that it\u2019d be impossible for him to defeat them both by solely relying on Jadeskin.\n\nHan Sen fired up his Dongxuan Sutra instead.\n\nHan Sen realized his Dongxuan Sutra had yet to be trapped, so he could still use it.\n\nFor a fight like this, Han Sen had an inkling that the Dongxuan Sutra was on the precipice of breaking through and having its tenth gene lock open.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t going to squander the opportunity, so he decided to abandon his initial idea of summoning Little Angel and just kept Dongxuan Sutra running while he carried on battling.\n\nThose two emperors were by far the strongest there, and the minor wounds Han Sen was being dealt were starting to add up. Han Sen\u2019s back already had more than a few wounds, and No God Emperor had just delivered another strike there with his No God Sword.\n\nHe had finally started to bleed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t serious, but Han Sen\u2019s mood shifted. His body was incredibly strong, but it was almost scary, learning Jadeskin could not protect him forever.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the primary reason for why his mood changed and the expression on his face differed.\n\nHe felt as if he was teetering on the brink of breaking through. Unfortunately, he kept falling short, and he couldn\u2019t surpass the verge and begin the process that would open his tenth gene lock. It was like he was being held back all that time.\n\nThis latest strike had now changed things, though, and it told him what he needed to do to open the tenth gene lock.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cDo I have to get hurt for the next gene lock?\u201d Han Sen decided to stop dodging and blocking. He stood firm and allowed his body to become recipient to the barrage of attacks that were headed his way.\n\nHan Sen had been using Dongxuan Sutra to dodge, but now he wasn\u2019t. No God Emperor and Ruin Emperor were surprised and a little concerned when they saw the change of attitude."
