    "text": "On their way to the palace, egg marks appeared on the foreheads of both Little Silver and Xie Qing King. It was very worrying.\n\nLake Viscount gained it, as well.\n\nXie Qing King held up a mirror to examine himself. He kept looking at it, and with a dire expression, he said, \u201cSo d*mn ugly! The mark could at least be a flower or something. Having an egg on my head makes me look stupid.\u201d\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t believe that was precisely what Xie Qing King was worrying about.\n\nLittle Silver was lying on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, not having any particular sort of reaction.\n\nWith Captain Wood leading them, they had no trouble on their journey. The power of four Marquise had already scared off most of the xenogeneics nearby.\n\nThey didn\u2019t bother killing any lower class xenogeneics they saw along the way, as they were focused on reaching the Raven palace as soon as they could.\n\nThey came to a valley, and Captain Wood cleared out the xenogeneics that were hanging around. Deep Blue Viscount followed closely, and spoke while pointing at a mountain.\n\n\u201cThe entrance is here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the peak! This is not an illusion. But there is no door. Are you sure this is the place?\u201d Captain Wood asked with a frown.\n\nYes, I am sure of it,\u201d Deep Blue Viscount said, as he trotted up to one of the mountain\u2019s cliffsides. He searched the wall for a while, and eventually, pushed his hands firmly against a rock.\n\nAfter Deep Blue Viscount pressed it, he returned to Han Sen. And then, a boom noise sounded swiftly after. A few hundred meters of mountain began to sink, as a higher peak began to rise behind it. There was a door on its stone surface, one that was massive.\n\nHan Sen and everyone else were in shock. The place had a grand, powerful atmosphere, which spoke volumes about how scary the Ravens might have been, once upon a time.\n\n\u201cHow do we open the door?\u201d Captain Wood asked Deep Blue Viscount.\n\nDeep Blue Viscount said, \u201cYou just have to push it open. That\u2019s how I slipped in and slipped out.\u201d\n\nCaptain Wood signaled for a Marquise to push open the stone door. It was dozens of meters high, but the Marquise was able to open it with a light push. There was no need for much strength.\n\nWhat resided beyond the stone door was equally impressive in size. Many palaces were visible inside, and the buildings extended until they vanished into the distance.\n\n\u201cMaster! You must follow behind me, with a gap of about three meters.\u201d Captain Wood stared at Black Steel with a serious look. And after Black Steel agreed, the team was allowed to enter.\n\nThe palaces were all connected. They were all built from stone, but they were so old, they looked very rustic and primitive. Even with the protection of the mountain, they looked poorly kept.\n\nHan Sen saw a multitude of carvings on the walls, depicting bird-like creatures. Large bird statues stood on both sides of the plaza.\n\n\u201cDeep Blue Viscount, will there be danger up ahead? Captain Wood asked.\n\nDeep Blue Viscount gave a wry smile. \u201cMany warriors died before I entered, but by the time I made it in, all was fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe when Chiron Earl went in, they destroyed any traps left behind by the Raven,\u201d a Marquise suggested.\n\n\u201cThat could be true, but even so, it is best to remain vigilant. We cannot drop our guard for a single second.\u201d Captain Wood was speaking with a deep, authoritative voice.\n\nThe group of them followed behind Deep Blue Viscount as they moved forward. It wasn\u2019t long before they stumbled across a pile of boney remains. They definitely belonged to Rebate.\n\n\u201cThey must have been part of the previous group.\u201d Captain Wood checked out the bones, and noticed the skulls each had a large hole in them. They were so big, you could squeeze a clenched fist clean through.\n\nThe team kept traveling. Their path had proven to be surprisingly uneventful. Aside from seeing the odd pile of bones here and there, there was nothing that posed an actual threat.\n\nHan Sen thought things over as he walked. \u201cWeird. It looks like this place has not been visited by anyone in quite a while. And there are some creatures outside that could most certainly not have been dealt with by a Viscount. How did Wind Viscount get into this palace and get himself infected with the Raven\u2019s mark?\u201d\n\nAlthough there was no danger, Captain Wood was being careful, nonetheless. He didn\u2019t speed up on his way; he remained at a slow and steady pace.\n\nAfter they walked a dozen miles, they went past a temple that had also been constructed from stone. Their eyes turned bright when they soon saw a pool of lotuses right next to it.\n\nThe lotus pool had no water, though. Most of the lotus\u2019s stalks, leaves, and flowers had all withered into death. There were only a few living ones left in the middle. The flowers that were alive were as white as snow. The leaves were like jade\u2019 and with their soft glow, they looked terrific.\n\n\u201cIs this the lotus pool you\u2019ve been talking about?\u201d Captain Wood looked at Deep Blue Viscount. \u201cThis is it. I accidentally fell in there and swallowed a lotus root. I was so hungry that I dug some up and ate more of them. That was how my mark disappeared.\u201d Deep Blue Viscount looked surprised, and he desperately wanted to run to it.\n\nHearing that, Lake Viscount and the other Barons all rushed towards the pool.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d Han Sen shouted, with a frown.\n\nNo one listened to Han Sen, though. They all wished to cleanse themselves of the egg mark plaguing their foreheads by ripping out the lotus roots and consuming them.\n\nEven though it would be a temporary pause Han Sen was calling for, it was better than getting ahead of themselves and snatching the plants right now.\n\n\u201cAnyone who steps closer to the pool dies.\u201d Captain Wood made a hum. And then, the two Viscounts and the Barons stopped moving.\n\nCaptain Wood looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cIt looks like your family members require some discipline.\u201d\n\nYes, and I will give it.\u201d Han Sen rubbed his nose. The Nobles in his employ were mostly spies of one sort or another. They didn\u2019t want to listen to his orders, particularly so if claiming the flowers meant the difference between life and death.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t followed Han Sen for very long, either. So, it was not as if Han Sen could control them.\n\n\u201cMister Wood, I beg of you to provide me some of this lotus root. I only need a little!\u201d Deep Blue Viscount quickly turned to begging.\n\nAfter Deep Blue Viscount said this, the other Barons started to beg, too. They all had a ticking timebomb planted on their heads, after all.\n\nBut Captain Wood ignored them. He walked over to the lotus pool and looked at the flowers. A while later he asked, \u201cDo you know what species of flower these are?\u201d\n\nEveryone shook their heads, not knowing what species of plant they were.\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026 Go ahead and dig up a lotus root.\u201d Captain Wood frowned while he spoke to the Barons.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the Barons responded happily.\n\nYou can dig it up, but if you dare steal a bite, I will cut your heads off,\u201d Captain Wood continued coldly. \u201cDig them up and I won\u2019t mistreat you. I won\u2019t give you any less, leastways.\u201d\n\nThe Barons looked bitter as they went forward to dig up the lotus roots. Captain Wood and the four Marquise kept their eyes peeled on them. No one dared to eat one of the roots against the Captain\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys moving?\u201d Captain Wood asked coldly, seeing Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng."
