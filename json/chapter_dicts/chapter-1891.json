    "text": "The little beast got hit, and it squealed in agony. It turned around and jumped towards Han Sen. Han Sen was very fast, and because his rabbit shoes were Duke class, he had Duke class speed to run with.\n\nThe beast was only Earl class, so it was much slower than Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen moved like a shadow. He swung his Ghost Teeth Knife and hit the little beast again. Every time he did this, a small wound was left on the creature. Over time, after many more strikes, those cuts were all over its body.\n\nThe wounds kept bleeding as a purple mist oozed out of the injuries. It was only a matter of time before the wounds started to spread.\n\nThe beast was injured, and being unable to withstand the pain, it sought to race back into Red Mist Valley to escape.\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. He had the speed, and he had a good knife to boot. Unfortunately, his powers were actually quite weak. The Viscount class godlight, with Teeth Knife, could not grievously injure the Earl class beast.\n\nHe continued to slash at the beast as well as he could, but the foe was still able to escape into the valley.\n\n\u201cLittle Uncle, draw him out again!\u201d Han Sen retreated to a position where he could hide.\n\nLittle Uncle ran back to the entrance, but this time without the bike. The bike was too weak right now, so it was pointless bringing it before an Earl.\n\n\u201cWhere are you running off to, boy? Come out and fight Grandpa Wang again!\u201d Wang Yuhang kept barking into the mist, but the creature did not reveal itself again. Perhaps it was because the beast really was quite injured.\n\nWang Yuhang shouted like that for a while, until his voice started to crack and leave him. Still, their foe refused to reveal itself again.\n\n\u201cHey, is it working? If it doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll just have to find another way,\u201d Xie Qing King shouted at Wang Yuhang.\n\nWang Yuhang acted confidently, and he said, \u201cWhat do you mean? Is it working? No! But I am a man, and I will not give up so easily!\u201d\n\nAfter that, Wang Yuhang turned his back to the entrance of the mist-veiled valley and pulled down his pants. He bent over to reveal his butt, and in a bid to provoke the enemies inside the mist, spread his cheeks. \u201cIf you have the balls, you\u2019d come out and fight with me! Otherwise, your kid is my kid.\u201d\n\nSqueak!\n\nAfter Wang Yuhang shouted, a red shadow appeared. It was the same beast, and it was still bleeding from the lacerations it had procured earlier. It ran out, very angry, as if Wang Yuhang had just slaughtered its parents.\n\nWang Yuhang started running, and eventually resummoned his armor. Unfortunately, he was a little late in doing that, and he suffered a bite. He lost a big chunk of flesh from his backside, which bled profusely.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Wang Yuhang kept running as fast as he could. Fortunately, he was able to reequip the armor and avoid getting bitten again. But the blood from his bum dyed the armor red.\n\nThe beast was still not keen on giving up, though, and it kept running after Wang Yuhang.\n\nHan Sen gripped his knife and ran out after it. With his speed, he caught up rapidly. The Ghost Teeth Knife, with Tusk, had created a nasty wound on the monster. The beast\u2019s recovery had been slow, as a result. The wounds it had incurred were still bleeding, and they were continuing to spread.\n\nThe beast wanted to kill Little Uncle, but Han Sen hit it again. Now that it had regained its senses, it tried to reverse course back to the valley.\n\nHan Sen kept slashing it. He cast Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and he ran them both at maximum velocity. His body looked like jade, and his blood was boiling.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong!\n\nAfter three swings, Han Sen felt as if his own blood was going to spill out. A weird, blood-like power entered his Ghost Teeth Knife and dyed it red.\n\n\u201cMutant Blood Ascended to Viscount.\u201d\n\nThe announcement rang inside Han Sen\u2019s mind, and it brought him sheer delight. The Blood-Pulse Sutra had finally leveled up.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe now reddened Ghost Teeth Knife was covered in a Jadeskin godlight. It came down on the beast and sliced its paws off.\n\nHan Sen felt very happy about this. The red blade he now wielded was flashing, and blood was being thrown about everywhere. Before the enemy could escape all the way into the mist, Han Sen was able to cut off its head.\n\n\u201cRed Mist Mink Xenogeneic Earl hunted; xenogeneic gene found. Xenogeneic beast soul obtained.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was happy. He picked up the beast and cut it open. He found a red bone inside its body, which he knew was the prized xenogeneic gene.\n\n\u201cHelp! I\u2019m going to die.\u201d Wang Yuhang was on the ground, screaming. His butt had been sorely injured.\n\n\u201cNo one told you to be that reckless.\u201d Xie Qing King kicked Wang Yuhang\u2019s bleeding butt, which prompted another scream.\n\n\u201cYou guys have no heart. I did this for you lot!\u201d\n\nXie Qing King looked at the man with disdain and said, \u201cYou had it coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Silver, go heal him,\u201d Han Sen called to Little Silver.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 argh!\u201d Before Wang Yuhang could finish, Little Silver fired two bolts of lightning at him\u2014one from each eye. They struck Wang Yuhang\u2019s bum and had him squealing in even more pain.\n\nLittle Silver\u2019s Viscount class healing was very effective. Its only downside was that it dished out a lot of pain. Wang Yuhang\u2019s wounds were completely healed after a short amount of time.\n\n\u201cLittle Uncle, try again. See if there are any more xenogeneics inside.\u201d Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang.\n\nWang Yuhang didn\u2019t want to, but he still shouted before the entrance of the valley. He wasn\u2019t taking his pants off this time, though.\n\nAfter a while, there appeared to be nothing more. Xie Qing King decided to sketch some shadows and send them into the valley, though. They soon disappeared, but not because they were attacked.\n\n\u201cIt looks like there are no more xenogeneics inside.\u201d Xie Qing King put his book away and approached the valley.\n\nThey all entered that place, and as suspected, they weren\u2019t attacked. The red mist was too strong, though, and they couldn\u2019t make out anything.\n\n\u201cThe mist is too strong! I can\u2019t see anything. I won\u2019t be able to see any sort of treasure, assuming there is something here,\u201d Wang Yuhang said.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t find anything there, so eventually, they abandoned the valley.\n\n\u201cThere has to be something. It\u2019s just that finding it will be annoying.\u201d Xie Qing King frowned.\n\nHan Sen was going to say something, but suddenly, an aircraft came flying down towards Mirror Lake.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like an aircraft that belongs to the Rebate. Who would seek to visit this place now, of all times?\u201d Han Sen frowned and called for everyone to return.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many electronic tools that could be used on Planet Eclipse. If they wanted to get some intel, they\u2019d have to go back to base.\n\nOutside of Mirror Base, an aircraft came to park. When the door of the ship opened, it revealed a woman with white, monk-like robes. The woman was very beautiful, and she had a red dot on her forehead. She was a Buddha."
