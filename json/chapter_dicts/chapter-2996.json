    "text": "One of the creatures had white hair. Its skin was black, and it looked like an old ape. The other one was like a spirit. It glowed with a green color. It was like a green ghost than one could see through.\n\nThe presence of these two xenogeneics was very powerful. They were clearly true god xenogeneics. That was undeniable.\n\n\u201cThanks for Godfather Han\u2019s arrival. I am fine. Why do I not see Dollar?\u201d Bai King smiled. It looked as if he did not care about the grudge he had with Han Sen in the past.\n\n\u201cDollar says he needs more time to prepare,\u201d Han Sen replied. \u201cHe is preparing a powerful weapon. He will come later.\u201d\n\nBai King nodded and said nothing. He pointed at the two xenogeneics and said, \u201cThis is Sun Moon God Ape. He is a powerful time element true god xenogeneic. This is Space Spirit. He is a space element true god elite. With their assistance and the power you and Dollar, the two of you elites, have, our operation will surely be a success.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very thorough.\u201d Han Sen turned around and asked, \u201cI wonder, how will you break the time god power trapping Golden Growler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is it.\u201d Bai King did not talk crap. He brought out the treasure.\n\nIt was a gold pair of jade scissors. The scissors\u2019 blades were metal and black in color. The bottom part was made of jade stone. It was pure white. The two blades were forged to look like a water dragon. They snapped together like two dragons playing orbs.\n\n\u201cThis treasure is called Light Scissor. It is made from the time element true god xenogeneic light dragon\u2019s xenogeneic genes. That is how it was crafted. Our alpha killed the female and the male, the two light dragons. With lots of rare material and other xenogeneic genes, it cost them tens of dozens of years to forge. That is how the Light Scissors came to be. It is very good against time restrictions and bai semas. It should be easy to break Golden Growler\u2019s time power. This will be the weapon that kills Moment God.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Bai King went on to say, \u201cI promised you I would let you have the scissors, but the light scissors are only supposed to be used by someone who has a time element power. I will let Sun Moon God Ape use of the scissors because he can provide us with the most help.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, the decision is still yours to make, Godfather Han,\u201d Bai King said. \u201cI am merely making a suggestion.\u201d He passed Han Sen the light scissors.\n\nHan Sen tried using his own power. He found that he was unable to activate the light scissors. He needed a time element power to use the top-class true god weapon. Han Sen thought, \u201cWhat a good fox. He knew I did not have time element powers, but he did not say only Sun Moon God Ape could actually use the light scissors. He is saying it is pointless for me to use it and only he can use it.\u201d He coldly laughed. \u201cBut you have the wrong intentions. I am not very good at time element powers, but I researched it.\u201d\n\nBai King watched Han Sen being unable to activate the light scissors and smiled. The Sun Moon God Ape looked quite cocky. He thought Han Sen would allow him to be the one who used the light scissors.\n\nAs Han Sen held the light scissors and looked at Sun Moon God Ape, when Sun Moon God Ape thought Han Sen was going to give him the light scissors, Han Sen\u2019s body exhibited some changes. The light scissors released the sound of two dragon\u2019s moaning. A black and white light was shining brightly. It turned into a pair of black and white dragons that circled Han Sen.\n\nSun Moon God Ape\u2019s face changed. Bai King was shocked too, but his face quickly returned to normal. He laughed. \u201cGodfather Han really is very unique. You have mastered time element powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a little bit, but it was enough to use the scissors,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. He put away the light scissors.\n\nThe light scissors were very strong, but they also cost a lot of power. Han Sen had just used them for a moment, and he already felt tired.\n\nSun Moon God Ape thought he would be the one to use the light scissors, but now there was no chance. He felt depressed. He was buzzing as he asked, \u201cWhy is that Dollar not here yet? Is he afraid of killing Moment God? Did he not dare come?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Bai King. He laughed and did not ask anything. It was unknown what he was thinking in his heart.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cAlthough Bai King does not know Han Sen and Dollar are the same people, thinking he won\u2019t suspect our relationship, perhaps he will think of something. This co-operative effort might be to test us. Fortunately, Bao\u2019er can make use of the sunglasses. Otherwise, Bao King is sure to think of something.\u201d\n\nAt this time, the few people saw Bao\u2019er, in the shape of Dollar, come flying over.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to keep you waiting,\u201d Bao\u2019er said. She was learning how Han Sen spoke.\n\n\u201cIt is good that you are here,\u201d Bai King said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cSince everyone is here, let\u2019s just get into the temple in case something bad happens.\u201d Han Sen summoned the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. He held the light scissors and the shield as he used time area. \u201cGood!\u201d Bai King nodded. No one had an opinion to share. Everyone just summoned their true god weapons and god personality armaments.\n\nBao\u2019er turned on her evil lotus bai sema and sky bone armor. Her body shone with a purple light. It displayed a knife light that was like a saw. It covered her entire body.\n\nBai King summoned his God Spirit\u2019s spirit body. Sun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit had their weird faces. Clearly, they had powerful power protection. Everyone used their powers before they approached the god temple because they were afraid that when they faced Moment God, they would not have the chance to bring out their gear.\n\nAfter preparing, everyone entered the god palaces.\n\nOnce they entered the realm of the god palaces, many creatures of the universe turned their attention to them.\n\n\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that Dollar? He is going to the god temple to kill a God Spirit again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is Bai King with Dollar?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa! Godfather Han Sen is there too. Last time, Moment God blew him up. He has dared to come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose two xenogeneics are not normal. It is such a powerful team. Which God Spirit are they going to challenge? It must be a Disaster class one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Disaster class? Dollar was able to kill a Disaster class God Spirit by himself. Who needs Bai King and Godfather Han, those elites, all to fight together? I am afraid the God Spirit they are going to kill is an Annihilation class one.\u201d\n\nMany scary elites in the universe were looking at Han Sen and the others make their approach.\n\nIn a palace on a red dwarf planet, the woman who was wearing a red qipao and using a red umbrella was looking at the sky. She gently said, \u201cMaster, Han Sen is going to challenge Moment God again. Should we go and do what Han Jinzhi told us to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think we should follow what he told us to do?\u201d Human King sat on the throne. He looked as if he was smiling, but he wasn\u2019t smiling. He watched Han Sen and the others enter the grounds of the god palaces.\n\nThe red-clothed woman was beneath her umbrella as she coldly said, \u201cAlthough Han Jinzhi does not have an heir, Han Jinzhi did not have to do this. Han Sen is his great-grandson, so they will have a connection. Perhaps he is using us to help Han Sen break through the line.\u201d"
