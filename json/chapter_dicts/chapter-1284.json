Eagerly, he thrust forward to meet with it, his own laser sword in-hand.\n\nThe SKTS lacked mobility in comparison to the opposition, however. The speed and thrusting capabilities were inferior to the model he was going up against, which put him at a disadvantage when it came to the needs for agility, and there\u2019d be no way around that.\n\nStill, Han Sen wasn\u2019t fazed by this. At the end of the day, he firmly believed, the victor was determined by the operator\u2019s skill. Everything boiled down to how well the operator controlled their machine in the thick of things, from the delicate ballet of movement to the timing of attack, and all the little things in between. It wasn\u2019t too far off battling without being inside such a machine.\n\nHan Sen might not have been able to drive as well as Xie Yuxin, and the lack of recent practice with warframes would usually result in a loss and the opponent being stronger.\n\nBut Han Sen had a higher fitness and a better level of judgment, and with that, he was going to even the odds.\n\nXie Yuxin was only an evolver, so her fitness wasn\u2019t even comparable.\n\nOf course, fitness was not the end-all, be-all of warframe operation. His higher fitness level would help to close the gap, but he still needed to control his warframe well. And that came down to raw, simple talent with the machines.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s skill with the warframe was still a little rusty, though, so he knew he had to rely on his fitness and judgment to help even the odds.\n\nThe audience were chatting a lot before the match, but when the fight began, they all fell silent.\n\n\u201cWeird. This guy looks sloppy, but then, why is Xie Yuxin having a hard time defeating him? This should\u2019ve been over real quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she playing poorly on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nThe SKTS was inferior on all fronts, and it wasn\u2019t being operated as smoothly as it could have been. The audience was primarily composed of self-asserted professionals. They might not have been the best in existence, but they really were proficient and knowledgeable when it came to watching and using warframes. They could all clearly see that Han Sen was a little rusty.\n\nBut the Sky Warrior, despite all its bells and whistles, and the fact it was taking every advantage, seemed to be the one getting beaten back. It was a perplexing sight, and for all intents and purposes, it should not have been happening.\n\nXie Yuxin, on the field of play, was unsure of what was going on herself.\n\nBecause Han Sen hadn\u2019t used a warframe in a long time, so he often made mistakes. Yet in a warframe fight, a mistake could very well be fatal, and a killing strike could come before the operator even acknowledged the blunder they had made. Knowing and understanding the constant mistakes he was making, she felt as if she should have destroyed him several times over by now.\n\nBut as time went on, she realized she couldn\u2019t. She wished to take advantage of every slip Han Sen made, but whenever she tried to, she was unsuccessful. It was frustrating, and it was starting to get her flustered. She almost thought he had to be purposefully playing with her.\n\nWhen Han Sen made a mistake, it almost seemed deliberate. He\u2019d slip in a spot she didn\u2019t expect him to be, or he\u2019d simply be too far away for her to reach. Some mistakes even enabled Han Sen to dodge her attacks.\n\nThis battle was starting to stress Xie Yuxin out, as it was unlike anything she had ever had to deal with before. If she was to be beaten by someone who was much stronger, plain and simple, that would be fine.\n\nBut this opponent was, for all accounts, supposed to be much weaker. And yet, no matter what she tried, she could not defeat him. She knew she could, and she knew she should have been able to, but she just couldn\u2019t.\n\nShe kept on attacking, not realizing she had been pushed into a corner.\n\nHan Sen found himself having a lot of fun with his warframe, and it took him back to his days in the military school.\n\n\u201cAm I getting old, thinking about the past? Nostalgia is the quotidian beast of aging,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nHan Sen was using Heavenly Go to dictate his movements.\n\nHan Sen made many mistakes, but he was able to predict each move his opponent was going to make, which had his mistakes fall in spots where he would be fine. Han Sen wished the fight would last longer, and he found it disappointing that he was so close to finishing her off.\n\nXie Yuxin kept on attacking without reprieve, unaware of where Han Sen had led her.\n\nThe audience, seeing everything, knew the Sky Warrior would be backed into a corner soon, and when that happened, her abilities would be severely limited.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Yu Shaoqing asked.\n\nThe professionals in the audience were not the best operators out there, and even they were perplexed by what had happened. Yu Qianxun was in a league of her own, so if anyone could elucidate the bewildering proceedings, it\u2019d be her.\n\nYu Qianxun helped to clear things up by saying, \u201cYou have unwittingly tried to hustle an elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way! He makes too many mistakes to be considered an elite. If we made those mistakes, the coach would be yelling at us until he was blue in the face.\u201d Yu Shaoqing didn\u2019t believe what he had been told.\n\nOthers were of a similar opinion, not believing Han Sen was a pro.\n\nYu Qianxun went on to say, \u201cYou might operate your warframes better than he does, but on a real battleground, this man would kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you pulling my leg? Is he really that good?\u201d The struggle to believe her was real.\n\nWhile they were talking, the Sky Warrior was pushed into a corner. And when she herself realized what had happened, it was too late for her to do anything. The SKTS struck her warframe, breaking it completely.\n\nXie Yuxin exited the holographic machine with red eyes.\n\nShe was not afraid of losing, but it felt as if she had been misled. The opponent was weak, and she had not at all anticipated such a defeat.\n\nShe was an adult, though. Her eyes were very red, but she did not cry."
