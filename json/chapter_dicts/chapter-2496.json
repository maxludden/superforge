    "text": "Despite countless attempts, Han Sen never succeeded in activating The Story of Genes\u2019 cogwheel. But now, things were different. Han Sen had the peacock king\u2019s soul robe. Through the buffs provided by the peacock king\u2019s beast soul, his power could rival that of a deified. With deified power behind him, Han Sen believed he\u2019d have what it took to finally put the self-cogwheel in motion.\n\nAfter a few days, Han Sen found the right time to do that. He locked himself in an isolated room and fired up The Story of Genes to get to work on his leveling up plan.\n\nHe summoned his peacock king beast soul, and the feathery soul robe appeared around Han Sen. The peacock symbol on the back of the robe began to glow.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. The rainbow peacock symbol suddenly became a peacock king shadow. It floated behind Han Sen.\n\nMany rainbow godlight buffs flowed into Han Sen\u2019s body then. Rainbow-like colors shimmered through his aura, generating a substance chain.\n\nWith that unlimited soul power, Han Sen cast The Story of Genes and used the rainbow godlight to push his self-cogwheel.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe rainbow godlight that could destroy planets was able to push The Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel, but the cogwheel only moved a tiny amount. It looked like an old door with rusty hinges. It was only slightly ajar.\n\nHan Sen was thrilled, though. He kept pushing the rainbow godlight power into the self-cogwheel. The soul robe allowed Han Sen to summon a mind-boggling amount of power, and yet, it seemed to be fighting an uphill battle as it struggled to push the self-cogwheel.\n\n\u201cSuch much power, yet it can barely move The Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel. If I used my own power, I have no clue when I would be able to get it moving. Perhaps I would have to wait until all my other geno arts were deified before I could push The Story of Genes to King.\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nThe self-cogwheel moved steadily, and after it completed one cycle, it started to move faster and faster. The spell symbol was getting brighter and brighter, too.\n\nIn the end, Han Sen was able to release his power, and the self-cogwheel was able to spin on its own. The door to the universal core hall was opened for him. Han Sen entered and discovered that he was actually someplace new. It was vastly different from the place he had expected to enter.\n\n\u201cUsing different self-cogwheels to enter the core area spawns me in different places, and that means I can appear in four different locations. That is interesting.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t stay for long. He proceeded to exit the core area.\n\nThe Tianxia System was too dangerous, so now wasn\u2019t the time for him to kick back and have a relaxed xenogeneic hunt.\n\nThe journey, however, was surprisingly free from strife. They traveled through the Tianxia System for another two weeks. Along the way, they didn\u2019t encounter any other deified elites. Han Sen was able to deal with ordinary xenogeneics and Kings easily.\n\n\u201cLittle Captain, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it\u2026 Captain, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it\u2026\u201d Han Sen and Bao\u2019er were playing Old Man. The pirates were watching. They kept shouting and clapping as they did. If people didn\u2019t know better, they would believe this was a television commercial.\n\nIn that fun atmosphere, it looked as if they were having a simple competition. Han Sen appeared relaxed, but he suddenly became serious.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, guess which card this is,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile. He was looking at Bao\u2019er\u2019s two cards.\n\n\u201cYou guess.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled and blinked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting smart, Little Evil. Not even I can see what you\u2019re thinking about these days.\u201d Han Sen looked at the two cards but hesitated. He couldn\u2019t tell what the two cards in Bao\u2019er\u2019s hands were. He couldn\u2019t tell which was the ghost card and which was the card that he needed.\n\nIf he picked the wrong card, and thus ended up with the ghost card, he would stand no chance.\n\nHan Sen looked at the nearby pirates. He wanted to see if he could read their faces to learn where the right card was, but he received no answer.\n\n\u201cDaddy, stop looking at them. They cannot see what card I have. You can\u2019t learn anything from their faces.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled beatifically and said, \u201cThis time, I\u2019m going to win.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled. He reached his hand out to a card and said, \u201cI want this card.\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen touched the card, Bao\u2019er\u2019s face changed. But it was only for a moment.\n\nHan Sen suddenly let go of that card and picked up the other. He flipped it over to reveal a three of hearts. It paired with Han Sen\u2019s three of spades.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2026 why I lost\u2026\u201d Bao\u2019er clutched her face, looking destroyed. She threw the ghost card down on the table.\n\n\u201cHa! Ha\u2026 your father is your father forever!\u201d Han Sen laughed and stroked her head.\n\n\u201cDo it again! I\u2019m going to win,\u201d Bao\u2019er pleaded while gripping the cards.\n\nHan Sen coughed into his hand. \u201cI think I\u2019m busy now. Let them play with you.\u201d Han Sen quickly stood up and shoved a pirate down to play with her.\n\n\u201cThis little girl is getting too smart. I almost got fooled by her. I cannot play with her anymore because losing would be way too embarrassing,\u201d Han Sen thought, touching his nose.\n\nBao\u2019er wasn\u2019t happy that she had finally found a chance to play with him, and she had still lost. She felt quite depressed because of this, and she took it out on the pirates. A short time later, the bodies of all the pirates were covered in stickers.\n\nHan Sen went back to his room and summoned Spell. Ever since The Story of Genes had become King class, Han Sen had tried to figure out what The Story of Genes\u2019 area did.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel didn\u2019t connect with any universal cogwheels, but it could still push the self-cogwheels of other creatures. The self-cogwheel of The Story of Genes was completely independent, though. It just kept spinning in place, all alone. It didn\u2019t connect with anything.\n\nAside from making Han Sen\u2019s body and genes stronger, he hadn\u2019t discovered what The Story of Genes\u2019 area did.\n\nSpell had become King class when he pushed his self-cogwheel. Some of her abilities had gotten stronger, but otherwise, she had gained no new forms or powers.\n\nAside from her body getting better, Spell was the same as when she was a Duke.\n\nHowever, Han Sen had been surprised to discover a self-cogwheel in Spell\u2019s body.\n\nSpell was just his geno armor, much like the Dongxuan Armor. They were just by-products of geno arts. They shouldn\u2019t possess their own self-cogwheels.\n\nBut Spell was like a real creature, and she had her own self-cogwheel. That really surprised Han Sen.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t been investigating how to use The Story of Genes, he probably wouldn\u2019t have looked at Spell\u2019s body with the Dongxuan Aura. It might have been a long time before he discovered her self-cogwheel.\n\nSpell\u2019s self-cogwheel was the same as Han Sen\u2019s self-cogwheel. It was like a copied version.\n\nHan Sen was sure that it wasn\u2019t his own self-cogwheel, though. And that was because he was unable to control Spell\u2019s cogwheel.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. \u201cDoes that mean The Story of Genes\u2019 self-cogwheel is designed to push Spell\u2019s own cogwheel?\u201d"
