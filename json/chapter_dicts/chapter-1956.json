    "text": "Clearly, the Meka Battle King and Clear Sea King had their sights on Little Seven. Han Sen was wondering if he should back out now, but as he was considering his options, a few people came out of the house. It was Speechless and the other Buddhas.\n\nHan Sen did not see Clear Sea King; it was just the young Buddha men and women. Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped.\n\nHan Sen followed them and turned on his Dongxuan Aura. He didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into hiding himself, as Speechless and the others didn\u2019t seem to be too paranoid. They were just walking around and chatting casually amongst each other, not suspecting they were being followed.\n\nBut Han Sen followed them for half a day without learning a single useful nugget of information. Their chatter was standard fare. Just as he was going to give it up, though, a Buddha man said, \u201cWhat is the master thinking? Why would he swap Galaxy Sand for those Meka babies?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised by this. He had heard of Galaxy Sand before. It was a famous treasure belonging to the Buddha, primarily.\n\nGalaxy Sand was not really sand. They were the tears of a King class xenogeneic called Galaxy Dragon. Each teardrop would become Galaxy Sand, and it was a rare treasure.\n\nGalaxy Sand possessed an impressive amount of energy. King class creatures that refined Galaxy Sand received many benefits. Low level creatures that used it would level straight immediately.\n\nClear Sea King was swapping it for Meka babies. It was a lot to give up, so he must have been doing it for something even bigger.\n\n\u201cShush.\u201d Another of the Buddha\u2019s stopped him from talking. He then lowered his voice and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. This is where the Meka live; we cannot let them know about the trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we afraid of? This is the Battle King\u2019s territory, and he is the one selling us the goods. What can they say about it?\u201d The Buddha lifted his lips, but he didn\u2019t look like he was going to push the topic too much further.\n\nSpeechless Lady frowned and said, \u201cJust be careful. Let\u2019s stop talking.\u201d\n\nSpeechless and the others walked around, and then they headed back to Battle King\u2019s house. Han Sen thought he wouldn\u2019t learn anything more useful than that, but Speechless received a message. Then, she told the other Buddhas, \u201cBuddha King has asked me to return. You guys go ahead, and I\u2019ll go find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go with you?\u201d a Buddha said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Speechless shook her head and then left.\n\nHan Sen followed her. He could not fight Clear Sea King, but Speechless was just a Viscount. If he had to, he could take her.\n\nHan Sen planned to capture her and ask her why Clear Sea King was snapping up the Meka babies.\n\nSpeechless walked alone as she headed towards Battle King\u2019s house. When she turned one particular corner, however, she frowned. A man that looked like a Buddha, wearing gold armor, appeared in front of her. Something seemed odd about him, but she couldn\u2019t quite tell what.\n\n\u201cI am Speechless, the Buddha Lady of the Buddha. Who are you? And why are you blocking my way?\u201d Speechless Buddha Lady was being careful, and she watched the man closely as she spoke.\n\nShe recognized Han Sen\u2019s armor. It was the man who owned Little Seven.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say a word, and he simply threw his hand forward to grab her.\n\nSpeechless Lady saw the hand get bigger in her vision. It was like it was consuming the entirety of space. It felt as if she had nowhere to run, and it was now she realized she had bumped into an elite.\n\nSpeechless\u2019s Buddha Light burst out. She summoned a Buddha sword. When it came to strike Han Sen, she spoke the Buddha catchphrase.\n\nThe distance to the Battle King\u2019s house was two kilometers, so her cries would reach Clear Sea King. With his power, he could definitely come and save her.\n\nBut when she opened her mouth, she unleashed a power minus its sound. It was like an empty sonic blast.\n\nSpeechless\u2019 face changed. Before she could react, Han Sen had grabbed her Buddha sword. Then, he used his finger to fire a coin. It landed on her chest.\n\nSpeechless suddenly felt so heavy. She ended up dropping to her knees on the ground. She braced herself with her hands, though, so she wasn\u2019t completely flattened out.\n\nHan Sen laid the Buddha sword across Speechless\u2019s neck, coldly telling her, \u201cI will ask, and you will answer. If you don\u2019t, I will cut your head off.\u201d\n\nSpeechless was putting all her strength into keeping herself from collapsing. The scary power from the coin made it feel as if her chest was going to explode. Pain radiated across her torso.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Don\u2019t you know my Clear Sea King and the Meka\u2019s Battle King are nearby? If you kill me, you\u2019ll be joining me soon,\u201d Speechless said, as if she was holding the ground at bay.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be dead, but you will be for sure. That is, if you refuse to answer my questions. Why are you buying up the Meka?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nSpeechless didn\u2019t answer, and it seemed as if it was a secret she willing to take to the grave.\n\nHan Sen swung the Buddha sword and cut open her armor. Her skin was revealed.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Speechless\u2019 face changed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not interested in women like you. If you don\u2019t answer me, though, I will strip you completely. And you can prance on down the street naked, so everyone can see you clearly. Only after will I cut your head off.\u201d\n\nHan Sen then went on to say, \u201cI am an impatient man, though, so I will ask you one more time. Why are you buying the Meka?\u201d\n\nSpeechless\u2019 face remained unchanged. When she didn\u2019t say, Han Sen cut the lower part of her armor off. He grabbed her by the scalp and started to drag her.\n\n\u201cWe are buying the Meka to fix a deified weapon!\u201d Speechless was shocked. She couldn\u2019t think anymore.\n\n\u201cWhat deified weapon? And how does it get fixed?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I have only heard a bit about it, but I know it\u2019s a knife. Only Clear Sea King knows the specifics,\u201d Speechless quickly said.\n\n\u201cUgh, you don\u2019t know anything. Why would I need you?\u201d Han Sen looked at Speechless without sympathy.\n\n\u201cIf you let me go, I will tell you anything you wish to know! If you let me go and gather the information, I will surely not disappoint you!\u201d Speechless said.\n\n\u201cI am giving you one last chance. If you still can\u2019t answer for me right here, enjoy performing on the streets,\u201d Han Sen answered, ignoring her plea. \u201cWhere is the Galaxy Sand you have stored to purchase the Meka? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s in Clear Sea King\u2019s pockets!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it really is with him\u2026\u201d Before Speechless finished, Han Sen grabbed her head again and dragged her across the street. Speechless* face changed and she shouted, \u201cIt really is on him! But I have a way to get it for you.\u201d"
