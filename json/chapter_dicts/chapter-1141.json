It flapped its wings and flew towards the big-eyed thief\u2019s rear. A countermeasure was in place, as the big-eyed thief shone gold and released a thick haze of toxic gas.\n\nBut the golden bird shone gold, as well. Its talons cleaved through the smoke and grabbed the big-eyed thief, and then tore the fiend in two.\n\nHan Sen and Queen were frightened by the sight, but they weren\u2019t shocked the musical note was able to fight another super creature. What did surprise them, though, was its ability to tear one in half with a single strike.\n\n\u201cIs that lady an emperor?\u201d Han Sen asked himself, still reeling from the shock of that grizzly sight.\n\nThe big-eyed thief\u2019s yellow miasma still hung in the air, and it was a ghastly smell. The creatures that had been caught inside it had all been killed.\n\nThe lady made a gesture with her gentle hand and wafted it away. The pleasant fragrance of the tree came back stronger, eliminating whatever was left of the big-eyed thief\u2019s stink.\n\nHaving seen what had just occurred to the big-eyed thief, no other creature in the vicinity dared provoke the lady now.\n\nBut none of the creatures dared leave the area, either. And they remained there, as if to guard the tree until its fruit was ready for consumption.\n\n\u201cGrabbing this fruit may prove difficult,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he rubbed his head. He was unsure whether or not he could obtain a benefit or be gifted a fruit from the pleasant-turned-cruel mistress of the tree.\n\nIf she was an emperor with ten gene locks open, Han Sen didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be able to obtain anything, even with the Blue Dinosaur and Disloyal Knight by his side.\n\nThat being said, the other super creatures in the vicinity would be too proud to allow the lady to take everything for herself. If chaos was to arise, Han Sen thought he might be able to nab something for himself amidst the carnage.\n\nHan Sen decided to wait alongside the rest of the creatures, and as he did so, he occasionally chatted with Queen. The two did not speak loudly though, and whenever they talked, they made sure to do so in whispers.\n\nThe lady, in the meantime, continued to remain perched in the tree. She swung her little legs delicately as she did.\n\nThe bird had gone by this point, and the lute had been returned, too. But eventually, the lady raised her arm and pointed her finger at Han Sen. Then she signaled for him to approach.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Regardless of race or species, the signal she had just made was a gesture for him to come closer.\n\nAt that moment, every creature in the region looked over to see who the lady was pointing at.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d Han Sen looked around, acknowledging she meant him without mistake. There were no other creatures around him, after all.\n\nThe lady smiled and nodded.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go. It is too dangerous,\u201d Queen pleaded. Although Han Sen was strong, the lady was too strange. It\u2019d be a risk to approach, but he didn\u2019t want to incite her ire by refusing her summons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can always turn away and leave. Besides, I\u2019m interested in seeing what she wants.\u201d Han Sen flew over to the tree, leaving the Blue Dinosaur behind to safeguard Queen.\n\nHan Sen was rather interested in the identity of who or what the lady actually was, but it was primarily due to the fact the fruit was on the precipice of maturing. Getting that close, in anticipation of that moment, was a good thing.\n\nNothing was better than being able to approach the tree without a fight. Although the lady was frighteningly powerful, Han Sen believed he could always escape whenever he wanted to.\n\nWithout anything barring his passage, Han Sen approached the tree with ease.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he hovered before her.\n\nThe lady pointed to another branch and bid that he sit with her.\n\nHan Sen did as she asked and took a seat on the branch, but he made sure to keep his distance and maintain his vigilance. He did not trust the lady, so he exercised every caution he could possibly take while spending time with her.\n\nHan Sen immediately noticed how good the lady smelled, and how her fragrance was actually different than that of the tree itself\n\nHer scent wasn\u2019t strong or overwhelming; it was light and refreshing.\n\n\u201cPretty Lady, do you need something from me?\u201d Han Sen asked with a smile.\n\nThe lady smiled in return, her face curious.\n\n\u201cHas a spirit never laid eyes on such a handsome face before? Did you need to take a closer look? You should take a picture,\u201d Han Sen jested, due to her awkward and intimidating silence.\n\n\u201cUm, pretty woman? Do you mind saying something?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThe lady maintained her stare in silence.\n\n\u201cUm, that\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need to speak. And I know I\u2019m handsome, so feel free to admire me all you like.\u201d Han Sen started to look at the jellyfish fruit that were tantalizingly near.\n\nThe fruit all looked alive, and they definitely seemed to be king-class geno fruit.\n\n\u201cThere must be more than ten thousand of these things. If they can all increase a person\u2019s super geno points, this sanctuary could see the rise of countless more elites,\u201d Han Sen believed.\n\nHan Sen had no idea what the fruit did, though. Moment Queen was probably hiding most of the story from him.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the lady finally asked."
