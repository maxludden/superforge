Aside from its body just being a white slate and several wriggling tentacles, it was like a human. That thing was sort of like a mini butterfly.\n\nIn the arms of the eight sound bug, it was holding an instrument that looked like a lute. It did, however, have eight strings. The eight sound bug\u2019s fingers were playing the instrument to make many crunching sounds.\n\nThe eight sound bugs played very good music, but Han Sen did not have the time to admire it. He was going to use his Xuan Yellow Sutra to get rid of it. He suddenly heard the sound of another instrument. This one was amazing.\n\n\u201cDid more eight bug sounds come?\u201d Han Sen stopped moving. If he went to disturb the creature, the other eight sound bugs would stop coming.\n\nOf course, not long later, a glowing thing emerged from the bush. It was a collection of eight sound bugs. They played several different instruments in harmony with each other. There was not a single note played out of place. It was like a wondrous musical festival.\n\nMany beautiful eight sound bugs were dancing out of the bushes. More and more of them appeared. Not long later, there were a dozen eight sound bugs.\n\nHan Sen knew that Night Cry Valley had lots of eight sound bugs, but he did not think there would be that many. It was just a small area, yet there were at least a dozen eight sound bugs.\n\n\u201cDing!\u201d The sound of another instrument was heard. This time, the instrument was different from the last one. When Han Sen heard this instrument, his heart felt a shock. He could not help but be entranced with an acoustic lust for it.\n\nIn fact, after the instrument\u2019s sound was heard, the dozen eight sound bugs and their instruments came to a close.\n\nHan Sen looked to where the instrument came from. He saw there was a bunch of silver light flying around the spring water. It was an eight sound bug glowing with silver light. He was not sure where it flew from, but it was now above the water. It kept flying around, playing the magical eight-string lute in its hands.\n\nOrdinary eight sound bugs were white, but this eight sound bug was a light silver color. Even the lute looked like it was made of silver jade. Its eight strings glowed with a silver light. The very small fingers plucked and pranced gently across them. It was like the sound of a mountain spring playing in Han Sen\u2019s ears. It made his heart feel as if it was being cleansed.\n\n\u201cA mutant eight sound bug?\u201d Han Sen felt quite happy about this. A mutant eight sound bug was an incredibly rare find. He did not expect to find a mutant eight sound bug there.\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen\u2019s body exploded. He was like a shadow that came before the mutant eight sound bug. His hand carried a red light as he struck the mutant eight sound bug.\n\nHan Sen was just a normal guy. He did not know how to appreciate music. Grabbing the mutant eight sound bug was more realistic.\n\nThe mutant eight sound bug was only earl class. It was a little stronger than the average viscount eight sound bug. Before Han Sen, it was extremely weak. It was battered by the red light in a jiffy.\n\nHan Sen did not watch the result of his strike. His body flashed. He suddenly threw 10 additional punches, resulting in a dozen eight sound bugs being struck by Han Sen\u2019s fists of fury.\n\nIncluding that mutant eight sound bug, all the eight sound bugs devolved into white gene eggs. The mutant eight sound bug only lasted a few seconds before it was reduced to a gene egg as well.\n\n\u201cWith this godly skill, I do not have to worry about not having any money to buy nice and spicy food.\u201d Han Sen put a dozen of those eight sound bug eggs in his hands. They rolled around in his palm like pearls. He felt really happy about this result.\n\nWhile he was feeling this joy, the sound of torn space was suddenly heard. He turned around and saw the woman he had seen earlier in the valley. It was the woman wearing that green veil to hide her face. She hurried forth with white wings flapping, flying there from afar.\n\nFeng Fei Fei had been waiting at the center of the valley. When the mutant eight sound bug appeared, she wanted to be the first to spot and catch it.\n\nWhen the mutant eight sound bug instrument was near the pool, Feng Fei Fei arrived there in haste. She tried to be as fast as she could be, but she was too late. When she arrived, she only saw Han Sen. He had already put the eggs away.\n\nFeng Fei Fei broke space and arrived. She did not see a mutant eight sound bug around. By only seeing Han Sen, she knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cThat is quite a coincidence. I heard the mutant eight sound bug\u2019s acoustics echo through the valley a couple of times before. Why did it appear next to this pond this time?\u201d Feng Fei Fei looked around, unable to spy the presence of a single eight sound bug. There was only Han Sen beside the pool. She guessed that Han Sen might have already killed the mutant eight sound bug and felt grossly disappointed.\n\nHan Sen looked at her, but he did not say a word. He turned and walked out of the valley.\n\nFeng Fei Fei broke space and came before him. There had been too many big movements, so the rest of the eight sound bugs were likely hiding in fear. They were done for the night. They probably were not going to show up for another few days.\n\nFeng Fei Fei thought about it but decided to stop Han Sen, who was on the cusp of leaving. \u201cMister, did you hunt the mutant eight sound bug?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat mutant eight sound bug? I have never heard of such a thing.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face did not look as if it was gasping or anything. He said that and quickly went outside the valley.\n\nFeng Fei Fei was enraged. If Han Sen told her he did not catch a mutant eight sound bug and said it had escaped, she could have accepted that.\n\nShe knew she had heard the instrument of the mutant eight sound bug from her position in the valley. Han Sen had been where the sound had come from. It was obvious was lying about the creature.\n\n\u201cPlease, do not misunderstand,\u201d Feng Fei Fei said. \u201cIf you are willing to sell me the mutant eight sound bug, I am willing to pay you twice the going rate in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not selling it.\u201d This time, Han Sen answered with certainty.\n\nThe mutant eight sound bug had become an egg. Feng Fei Fei would be suspicious if she saw it. The gene egg would be worth a lot more than just double the price. It was a rare mutant gene egg. Even if its level was not too high, he could still sell it for 10 times the price.\n\nPlus, with a rare gene egg, Han Sen wanted to put it on his online shop to draw attention and fame.\n\nFeng Fei Fei was very disappointed, but this had already happened. She had no choice but to give up.\n\nHan Sen carried the stone box with him. He had reached the center of the Night Cry Valley by this point. Suddenly, he saw a handsome man riding a white unicorn arrive. He was wearing white-jade armor.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much the price, I am buying the mutant eight sound bug. Give me the sum.\u201d The man sat atop the unicorn like some proud man, looking down on the earth and Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMister Jin, what are you doing here?\u201d Feng Fei Fei, who was leaving, frowned upon seeing the handsome man.\n\n\u201cI heard, Miss Fei Fei, that you came to Night Cry Valley alone,\u201d Mister Jin said with a smile. \u201cI was afraid you might be in danger, so I followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mister Jin.\u201d Feng Fei Fei was not happy about this, but she did not let it show.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure.\u201d Mister Jin displayed a charming smile. He looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cMister Fei Fei requires a mutant eight sound bug. Just tell me how much you are selling it for. No matter the price, I will not bargain or haggle. Tell me the price.\u201d\n\nFeng Fei Fei wished to say something, but she had already heard Han Sen was not willing to sell. She looked at Han Sen with shock."
