    "text": "\u201cSo, are you guys revolting?\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s expression changed.\n\nThe demon lady, Auntie Mei, laughed at Han Sen. \u201cYou are Little Master\u2019s father. You are a guest here. You are a guest in Sacred, but the holy spirit is very important. It is an item for your son. I am sure you would not want to steal what belongs to your son, would you? I hope you are willing to return the holy spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can return the holy spirit,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. \u201cGive me Littleflower, and I will hand it over.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittleflower is not in Sacred right now,\u201d Auntie Mei said. \u201cJust give me the holy spirit and it will be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will wait for him to come back,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\n\u201cIf he was going to deliver it to anyone, it would be the Little Master!\u201d Nine Thousand King shouted from his nearby position. \u201cWhy would he give it to you guys? Hurry up and lead the way. Allow Mister Han to wait in the holy palace for Little Master\u2019s return.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cannot enter the holy palace,\u201d Red Ghost coldly said.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he enter the holy palace?\u201d Nine Thousand King asked. \u201cHe is Little Master\u2019s real father. Why can he not enter the holy palace?\u201d\n\nRed Ghost stared at Nine Thousand King and grumpily said, \u201cStop shouting. Butterflies develop from caterpillars. Butterflies can fly. Can caterpillars fly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Nine Thousand King was furious.\n\n\u201cIt means exactly what I said. Give me the holy spirit and get the hell out! When Little Master needs it, he will go and look for it.\u201d Red Ghost and Nine Thousand King stared at each other. They were like fighting cocks.\n\n\u201cHow dare you ignore Mister Han! He was told to come to the holy palace by the leader. Why are you disobeying his order?\u201d Nine Thousand King was so angry that he was shaking.\n\n\u201cDo you think I am going to believe what you tell me?\u201d Red Ghost asked with disdain.\n\nNine Thousand King wanted to say something, but the demon lady interrupted him. \u201cThousand Eye, Sacred Hall is a different place. That is the last hope of Sacred. Only Little Master can go inside. No one else can go inside, including people like us. If you want to do a good deed for Sacred, you should at least understand that.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Auntie Mei said to Han Sen. \u201cOld Cat must have told you the situation regarding Little Master. With us taking care of him, he is in good care. He is not in danger. You do not have to worry about that. Right now, Little Master is going to be deified. Not long after, he can build Sacred up again. Then, the Sacred door will open, and you can come and see him and become a full-time guest of Sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding the holy spirit, that is the item Little Master needs to liberate Sacred. Otherwise, when Sacred re-opens, harm will come to Little Master. You are Little Master\u2019s father. You would not want to see Little Master be harmed, would you?\u201d The demon lady flicked her hair. She squinted her eyes and went on to say, \u201cI have told you this much because you are the father of Little Master. We would have killed you and taken the holy spirit back with ease if you weren\u2019t. We would not waste so much time talking crap if you were anybody else. We respect you because you are Little Master\u2019s father. I hope you can understand this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does re-opening Sacred entail? What kind of danger will Littleflower have?\u201d Han Sen frowned and looked at Auntie Mei.\n\n\u201cThat is Sacred business!\u201d Old Vulture screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s expression was gloomy. \u201cSacred business? Littleflower is my son. Are you saying things about my son are none of my business?\u201d\n\n\u201cKid, do not make us go hard on you. If you make us fight you for the holy spirit, we will not even care about you being Little Master\u2019s father.\u201d Red Ghost\u2019s body was moving. He was like a big beast that could swallow the sky. He was oppressing Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s personality was very stubborn. He only took things softly. He didn\u2019t take them hard. Besides, this affected the safety of Littleflower. He was not willing to fall back now.\n\n\u201cI am afraid you do not have what it takes,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. He drew his cause karma knife. He held the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze in his other hand.\n\nAlthough the holy spirit and beast soul had different names, they were the same thing. If he was not able to use force and take the beast soul, the holy spirit would be the same. If the master died, the holy spirit would be gone. Han Sen did not think they could take the holy spirit out of him without killing him.\n\nIf they were able to just take it, the demon lady would have already attacked. She would not have spent so much time talking to him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Red Ghost, Old Vulture, and the other\u2019s had dark expressions. They did not expect Han Sen to become so hostile.\n\nIn the Sacred era, they had been invincible existences. Not many people were able to fight them. In this era, they were stronger than ever with their titles.\n\nEven powerful people like Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, who was the best in the universe, had been trapped by the eyeless big beast.\n\nHan Sen was just a creature from the sanctuaries. He was only butterfly class, yet he dared to raise his voice against them. They did not think something like that could happen.\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Han Sen looked calm. He looked past Old Vulture into the darkness.\n\nHan Sen was looking toward where Red Ghost had come from. If that was true, that was where the holy palace resided.\n\n\u201cI do not care what this place is. I do not care about who you people are. I do not care about reopening Sacred. I do not care about shining the whole world. In my eyes, it is all sh*t. If something harms my Littleflower, come hell or high water, I will tear it up.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen said that, he passed the stone lantern to Bao\u2019er and said, \u201cBao\u2019er, hold the lantern for Dad. We are going to tear up this lame, holy palace. It has already fallen once. Let it forever remain inside a history book.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er sat on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder. She held the stone lantern and shouted with excitement, \u201cTear it down!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not have what it takes.\u201d Red Ghost grunted with obvious disdain.\n\nThe demon lady looked at the stone lantern. She was shocked and asked, \u201cWhy is Sacred\u2019s race lantern in your hand?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Race lantern?\u201d Red Ghost, Old Vulture, and the eyeless beast were shocked. They looked at the stone lantern in Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand.\n\nThey were shocked to see it. Red Ghost screamed, \u201cRace lantern\u2026 It really is Sacred\u2019s race lantern! How could he have it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sacred lantern is still here, so\u2026 Does that mean\u2026\u201d Old Vulture was so excited that he was trembling.\n\nHan Sen heard what Old Vulture said. He felt strange about why Sacred\u2019s race lantern was not inside the geno hall but was instead inside the universe. Han Sen was not able to care too much about that fact just yet. He jumped up and raced into the darkness in the direction of the palace.\n\n\u201cI do not care about some f*cking Sacred Leader or some race lantern. Whatever hurts my son is going to be broken.\u201d Han Sen was very angry. He cast Blood-Pulse Sutra and Jadeskin to the max. It made his body become ice jade. His skin was half-transparent, and it was glowing."
