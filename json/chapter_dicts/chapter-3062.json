    "text": "When they had almost left Ancient Big God Mountain, Li Bing Yu suddenly said, \u201cIf it was me, I would not go into town right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen looked at Li Bing Yu with interest.\n\n\u201cOu Yang Qiu Shan was killed in Ancient Big God Mountain,\u201d Li Bing Yu said. \u201cHe was the only person who had a perfect God Spirit Blood-Pulse in the past few years. He was the Ou Yang family\u2019s favorite child. The Ou Yang family will not just let this slide.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying the Ou Yang family is going to lay the blame of his death on our feet?\u201d Han Sen quietly asked.\n\n\u201cSomeone will be held accountable for this,\u201d Li Bing Yu said. \u201cPerhaps the Ou Yang family might not do anything to Peaceful, but it is hard to determine what might happen to the others. Their son died. They will probably do something to allay their anger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a grudge with Ou Yang Qiu Shan, and we did not offend him,\u201d Han Sen said with a frown. \u201cWhy would they want us dead?\u201d\n\nLi Bing Yu coldly said, \u201cIf a crown prince is murdered out there, the guards that were in charge of protecting him would all be killed. Does that make sense to you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cI suppose you are right. In that case, where do you think I should go?\u201d \u201cYou can go anywhere, just avoid Ancient God City,\u201d Li Bing Yu said. Don\u2019t go there again. In my opinion, you should leave the planet. Ou Yang family members are only nobles in Ancient God City. Once you have left this planet, the Ou Yang family will no longer pose a threat to you.\u201d \u201cDo you think the Ou Yang family is stronger than the blood ghost spirit?\u201d Han Sen looked at Li Bing Yu and blinked as he spoke. \u201cRegarding sheer power, the Ou Yang family is not stronger than you, but the Ou Yang family are nobles of the Qin Kingdom. You, however, are a nobody in the Qin Kingdom. If there is ever a conflict, even if you kill the Ou Yang family, you\u2019ll have a lot of trouble in the Qin Kingdom territories.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right.\u201d Han Sen was not afraid of the Ou Yang family, but it would be very troublesome.\n\ne\n\na\n\n\u201cIf you need it, I have a way to safely send you to another planet,\u201d Li Bing Yu said.\n\nAfter thinking a moment, Han Sen said, \u201cThank you. But before that, I need to locate Mister Yang.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will not be difficult. If he is in Ancient God City, I can ask him to come out and meet with you. But it is not on me whether or not he wants to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nLi Bing Yu looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cIf ordinary people have to choose between you and Dragon Song City\u2019s Peace family, people will choose the latter option. If it was you, what would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what, we must bring him back,\u201d Han Sen coldly said. \u201cIf we cannot do that, I will go back to the city myself to find him.\u201d\n\nMister Yang knew that Han Sen had come out of a gene egg. He wanted an explanation as to how that came to be. Han Sen was not going to just simply leave it alone.\n\n\u201cFine, I understand. I will bring Mister Yang back,\u201d Li Bing Yu said. She then turned into smoke and vanished.\n\nLi Bing Yu was a very efficient person. Even Han Sen was surprised. She only took half the day to bring Mister Yang back. \u201cMister, you are safe!\u201d Mister Yang was so happy to see Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI am planning to leave Ancient God Planet.\u201d Han Sen looked at Mister Yang and asked, \u201cAre you going to follow me or are you going to stay?\u201d \u201cI already said I would follow you to the ends of the world,\u201d Mister Yang quickly said. \u201cI will always go with you wherever.\u201d \u201cIn that case, Ghost Kill, please arrange things.\u201d Han Sen looked at Li Bing Yu as he spoke.\n\n\u201cThat will be no problem. Where do you want to go?\u201d Li Bing Yu was happy. She thought, \u201cIf he is going to the Qin Kingdom\u2019s capital, I can get closer to Crown Prince Qin Bai.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to Turin Planet,\u201d Han Sen quietly said.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Hearing that Han Sen did not want to go to the Qin Kingdom\u2019s capital, Li Bing Yu was disappointed. She did not say anything negative and simply agreed.\n\nW\n\nHan Sen\u2019s decision to go to Turin Planet was not a random one. Legends claimed that the Big Qin Kingdom\u2019s emperor Qin Xiu was born on Turin Planet. It was Qin Xiu\u2019s home.\n\nQin Xiu and Qin Wan\u2019er were alleged to have been born there, so Han Sen thought it was worth scoping out. He hoped to find a lead there.\n\nHan Sen and Mister Yang operated beneath what Li Bing Yu prepared. They reached an interstellar cargo ship with Li Bing Yu.\n\nTraveling in space took a long time. Han Sen found a chance to browse the internet. He had been researching the content of the notebook.\n\nAfter he had a deep session of research, the information he learned surprised him.\n\nQin Xiu put Qin Wan\u2019er\u2019s body in a mysterious coffin and sealed her inside. It preserved her body, keeping her look the same way as the moment of her death. It prevented her corpse from rotting. Afterward, he waited for his chance to revive her.\n\nAn important officer of the Qin Kingdom was Bai Mo. Qin Xiu commanded him to find a skill that could resurrect the dead. He wanted to bring Qin Wan\u2019er back from the dead.\n\nBai Mo tried many ways to accomplish it, but nothing worked. In the end, he found some information. That information came from an old place in the original star. Many things were recorded and too surprising to believe.\n\nAfter Bai Mo shared his research, no one dared to believe what was written, but most of the parts really did exist.\n\nThe notebook did not mention what it was, but there was a line that shocked Han Sen.\n\nDeath was just another beginning. Bai Mo must have looked tense when he wrote that down. His handwriting looked different from how it was normally. It looked like a fast scrawl. It was easy to tell how excited he was.\n\nThat sentence was something other people would not understand the meaning of. When Han Sen saw the sentence, he was fairly confident of his guess.\n\nThe content behind it tried to explain what it meant, which was that energy was forever. It would not disappear. It would just appear in different shapes.\n\nHumans and the creatures of the universe of kingdoms were energy. They would not disappear from the universe. When a human died, they continued with another life.\n\nAccording to Bai Mo\u2019s research, after a human died, they were born in another world. If they died in the other world, they would be born in the universe of kingdoms.\n\nBai Mo called this energy-changing process \u201creincarnation.\u201d It was unknown if it was a coincidence, but Bai Mo called the other world the antimaterial world. If the creatures from the right world did not exist in the antimaterial originally, they would be destroyed if they tried to cross over.\n\nThe creatures between the two worlds always believed the opposing world was the antimaterial world.\n\nThis suggestion suited Han Sen. He had guessed this as well. There was something Han Sen had yet to understand. What role did a God Spirit play between these two worlds?\n\nThe content in the back shocked Han Sen even more when Bai Mo researched an old faction. He discovered that this old faction had a relic that opened a path to connect the two worlds.\n\n\u201cThe crystal stone!\u201d Han Sen saw the relic on the notebook. It was in the same shape as the black crystal stone. It was just like the one he saw on the cave wall."
