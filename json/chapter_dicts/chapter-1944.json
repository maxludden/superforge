    "text": "Seven Spirit sprinted toward Han Sen. He wanted to slay Han Sen as soon as he fell. But Han Sen only dipped a little, then immediately sprang back to his feet. His speed did not diminish, either, as he kept on running forward.\n\nSeven Spirit\u2019s brow furrowed. He wielded his wooden gong with a thousand Buddha hands.\n\nDong!\n\nThe sound of thunder rumbled in Han Sen\u2019s heart, like it could annihilate the spirit of any being.\n\nBut Han Sen was not affected, and he continued running. In the times between Seven Spirit\u2019s use of his thousand Buddha hands, Han Sen was able to increase the distance that separated the two.\n\nSeven Spirit frowned harder. He channeled all his power into his legs so he could focus on catching back up to Han Sen.\n\nDue to Han Sen\u2019s provocation, Seven Spirit had cast the scariest powers he had. It had cost him a lot of energy, and the distance between the two was quite large now. He didn\u2019t want to risk exhausting more of his strength.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s speed was a boon of the rabbit shoes. Beast souls had their own power, and they didn\u2019t tax Han Sen\u2019s own energy reserves. As a result, he\u2019d never have to slow down.\n\nThey both kept running across the desert. Seven Spirit kept trying to attack Han Sen, but Han Sen was able to evade each and every strike. Han Sen\u2019s opponent was unable to damage him in the slightest.\n\nWhen Han Sen was hit by the Buddha\u2019s sonic attack, he had been injured. Fortunately, he had practiced sonic hyper geno arts in the past. He was no stranger to what they could do. When Seven Spirit attacked the second time, he used Yin Yang Blast to reverse some of the Buddha\u2019s sonic power that was bearing down on his Marquise armor.\n\nIt made it look as if he was not affected by the Buddha\u2019s second sonic attack. His Marquise armor, however, was full of cracks. He had indeed been injured. Still, Han Sen was able to hold on. And with his speed not slowing down, Seven Spirit believed Han Sen had not been damaged by the Buddha\u2019s sonic attack.\n\nIf Seven Spirit struck the wooden gong more, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it.\n\n\u201cThis guy is annoying. It is lucky that I am able to understand a bit of the reach of his strength.\u201d Han Sen used his rabbit shoes to keep on running.\n\nHan Sen had nothing else to do right now, and so he had to keep on doing this. Seven Spirit was using all his power to chase Han Sen, and Han Sen didn\u2019t think he could continue doing this indefinitely.\n\n\u201cI am going to tire you out! I\u2019m not afraid of you, because I have a beast soul.\u201d Han Sen gritted his teeth and ran. He was going to compete with Seven Spirits with stamina, and nothing else.\n\nSeven Spirit was pledged to do the same. He couldn\u2019t kill Han Sen, and his marks were useless. He didn\u2019t attack, and so he preserved his energy for the purpose of running.\n\nSeven Spirit did not think Han Sen, who was a Viscount, could keep up that speed for long. He had a plan.\n\nIf Han Sen kept running like that, the noise of Heaven would bear down louder and louder. Seven Spirit had a Buddha geno art that granted him a strong resistance to the noise. He did not think Han Sen could last as long as he would under the power of those sounds.\n\nOnce Han Sen was controlled by the music, Seven Spirit would have Han Sen\u2019s life under his thumb.\n\nWhen Seven Spirit stopped talking, Han Sen decided to provoke him some more. He hoped his nemesis would be angered into attacking again, exhausting more of his energy.\n\nSeven Spirit did not say anything. He did not attack, and he just kept chasing. Looking at Seven Spirit\u2019s eyes, he seemed like the devil. His entire body carried a bad aura.\n\nWhile Han Sen ran, he saw a few shadows ahead. When he drew nearer, he noticed it was Luo Ji and a few others.\n\nHan Sen ran to Luo Ji and shouted, \u201cMister Ji, help! Seven Spirit wants to kill me.\u201d\n\nWhen Luo Ji heard Han Sen, his own face changed. He then shouted, \u201cRun!\u201d\n\nThey all ran without hesitation. In Luo Ji\u2019s heart, he yelled, \u201cHan Sen is an *sshole who\u2019s going to get me killed!\u201d\n\nLuo Ji\u2019s brain responded quickly to this. He knew what was going on here.\n\nSeven Spirit wanted to kill Knife Queen\u2019s student. If Knife Queen knew about this, the Buddha and the Rebate would suffer a big divide. If anyone saw Seven Spirit chasing Han Sen, they might be killed.\n\nLuo Ji ran fast, but when he turned around, he saw Han Sen was next to him. Luo Ji couldn\u2019t outrun him. Luo Ji shouted, \u201cYou *sshole! We have no grudge with you. Why bring us harm?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \u201cYou did the same to me in Demon\u2019s Grave; this is you getting your just deserts.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had his rabbit shoes, so he was able to run faster than Luo Ji. When Han Sen was about to pass them by, he leaped over their heads.\n\nLuo Ji knew he could not let him pass. If he did, Seven Spirit would reach him first, and Luo Ji and his people would be killed.\n\nLuo Ji shouted, \u201cBlock him!\u201d\n\nAfter that, he drew his knife out and tried to cut Han Sen. The knife came at Han Sen like a demon. The black smoke lurched toward Han Sen, and it made onlookers think there\u2019d be no way for him to block it.\n\nThe Demons around Luo Ji tried to attack Han Sen, too. They had not practiced Sky Demon Sutra, and neither did they have Sky Demon powers. All they used were geno arts.\n\nBut they were all Earls. And there was a Marquise in their midst. When they attacked, they did so with grand strength.\n\nHan Sen did not move, and the Sky Demon powers hit Han Sen. So did the others, with their scary attacks. Han Sen\u2019s body exploded like a water balloon.\n\nAbove their heads, though, Han Sen\u2019s body reappeared. He flew right over them like a bolt of light. What they had attacked was one of Han Sen\u2019s clones. He produced it from his Moon skills.\n\n\u201cSplit up!\u201d Luo Ji could not prevent Han Sen\u2019s advance, so he barked the command and ran. Each Demon went off in a different direction.\n\nHan Sen, seeing Luo Ji respond so quickly, thought he was something of a genius. But even so, he was as evil as an old fox. Han Sen was hoping the crew could buy him some time, but that looked like it might be unlikely to happen.\n\nThey all ran their separate ways, and Seven Spirit Buddha was unable to catch up to kill them all. There was no point in killing them, and he appeared to be letting them go.\n\nWhat happened next shocked Han Sen, though. Seven Spirit shone with gold. His body became golden, and he expanded three meters in every direction. Each side of his head grew an extra face, and his body sprouted an additional six arms.\n\nHe had eight arms and four faces. He looked like a weird Buddha statue.\n\n\u201cThis guy is a xenogeneic!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face changed, and he knew what he was going to do."
