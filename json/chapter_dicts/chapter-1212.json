The flesh of this creature is inedible, but you may harvest its Life Geno Essence. Consume its Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nWhen the Little Angel delivered one last strike to the snake\u2019s head, the announcement rang inside Han Sen\u2019s head. The snake\u2019s body decomposed, leaving a black Life Geno Essence behind. Han Sen took it and placed it in his pocket. Then he walked forward.\n\nThe crystal ball had incinerated all the hair across the snowball\u2019s body, but it stopped torturing the creature when Little Angel finished off the snake. If it hadn\u2019t, the snowball would have surely have been killed.\n\nSeeing Han Sen approach victorious, the snowball summoned another white ball for protection and tried to leg it out of there.\n\nThe ball moved slowly, though, and Han Sen was quick to step on it.\n\nHan Sen slashed the ball, but it did not break. It looked like the ball was just as strong, despite the fact that the creature that summoned it had been hurt. But given the reduced movement speed, at least that was dependent on the host.\n\nHan Sen picked up the crystal ball that now lay on the ground, motionless. It must have been the treasure Ghost-Toxic Chi had created.\n\nIt looked like a fine, pure crystal, but it continued to produce a black smoke. Han Sen put his energy into the orb, and when he did, a strange connection was established. He was now able to control it.\n\nHan Sen commanded it to move over to the white ball. It did, and when it landed on top of the white ball, it produced a neat puncture.\n\nThe snowball tried to flee again, but Bao\u2019er stopped it this time.\n\nHan Sen picked up a number of dry branches that were scattered about the cave, put them together and started a fire. Then, he boiled a pot of hot water. The snowball was tied up next to it. Han Sen was going to wash it and then spitroast it later.\n\nBao\u2019er watched the snowball as Han Sen took the time to investigate the curious snake eggs.\n\nThere were so many eggs there, and there was no doubt in Han Sen\u2019s mind that Ghost-Toxic Chi would have been the undisputed king of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary if even half of those eggs could have resulted in the birth of a super creature. But those eggs, no matter how many were destroyed, did not provide Han Sen an announcement.\n\nHan Sen picked up another one and crushed it, to a dismal silence. He did, however, detect a weak lifeforce within. Han Sen had no clues what they were, so he summoned Dragon King and asked him. Perhaps he could elucidate a few things.\n\nIt had been a while since Han Sen consulted him, so the first thing Dragon King said was, \u201cIt was a mistake! I will never be so presumptuous ever again.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this. What is it?\u201d Han Sen did not care too much for what he had just been told.\n\nDragon King examined the eggs that were all around. He moved up to them and examined them closely. He looked happy, and he said, \u201cThese are super creature eggs!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuper creature eggs? But killing them provided me with no announcement,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King explained, \u201cWell, most of them are just dummy eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a dummy egg?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cSuper creatures don\u2019t just spit out babies all in the same way. Many creatures birth them in different ways, and their nesting protocols and habits differ, too. Super creatures can produce a lot of eggs, but not all of them bear life. Usually, just one egg can absorb an essence and become a proper super creature. The rest of the produced eggs are pretty much just food, all for the super creature when it is born. In their abundance, they can also hide the proper super creature egg before it is born. Hence, the term \u2018dummy.'\u201d Dragon King paused for a moment, and then went on to say, \u201cOne, somewhere in here, is a super creature egg. I can\u2019t believe you have gone to such great lengths, all for little old me. What is this creature, may I ask?\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not respond to that, but he asked, \u201cHow do I tell which is the proper super creature egg?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that can be difficult. It can look exactly the same as the dummy eggs, but super creatures who don\u2019t appreciate the concept of hiding in plain sight tend to keep them in a special place.\u201d Dragon King then started to fly around in search of it.\n\nBut Dragon King, after a lengthy search, was unable to find it. The cave was a mess.\n\n\u201cDid the proper egg find itself scrambled in the midst of the fight earlier?\u201d Dragon King asked.\n\n\u201cIf it was, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to find.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Dragon King asked.\n\nHan Sen raised a coin and broke one egg, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll find out when I get the announcement.\u201d\n\nHan Sen then raised his hand, ready to produce more coins and destroy more eggs.\n\nDragon King started flying around trying to cover the eggs like a concerned mother, pleading, \u201cNo! No! No! I\u2019ll find a way. Such needless destruction is so\u2026 needless!\u201d\n\nWoof! Woof! Woof! The fluffy snowball started to bark.\n\nHan Sen looked at it, and it seemed as if the creature had something to add to their discussion. Bao\u2019er had a whip, and she lashed it. But the furry pleader still requested Han Sen\u2019s attention and woofed again.\n\nHan Sen used his dongxuan aura to read the creature\u2019s mind and heard, \u201cI know where the Ghost-Toxic Chi\u2019s egg is!\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned. That creature was most certainly something special, and if it wasn\u2019t for the poisonous property the snake possessed, he doubted a berserk super creature would have the strength to penetrate the white balls it produced on a whim.\n\nIf he killed it for the beast soul, Han Sen couldn\u2019t be certain he\u2019d receive what he wanted. If he added the creature to his roster of pets, though, it could be useful.\n\nHowever, it had proven itself to be evil. Han Sen couldn\u2019t be so quick to trust it."
