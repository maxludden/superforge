Being blessed by Moon God\u2019s twelve moons will have made him stronger.\u201d Moon- Wheel King was sipping on a cup of tea as he spoke.\n\nYisha smiled. She was satisfied that Han Sen had been able to raise a twelfth moon.\n\n\u201cTwelve moons? Han Sen is not bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Otherwise, Knife Queen would not have taken him as a student.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you say it is possible for him to achieve more than twelve moons?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid that might be too difficult. Over the course of a few hundred years, only four or five outsiders have been able to achieve twelve moons. The chances of him getting more are too low.\u201d\n\nAs everyone rabidly discussed this, another moon rose up into the sky.\n\n\u201cThirteen moons? He broke through the expected threshold!\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting. Queen really did find herself a special student. Han Sen must be something special. He sure has a bevy of good luck.\u201d\n\nNight River King was in shock. He didn\u2019t expect that Han Sen could bring up twelve moons.\n\nNight River King had lost the Dragon Steel he had offered in the wager, but he did not mind. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Han Sen to be this lucky. I will have the Dragon Steel delivered to Planet Black-Moon later.\u201d\n\nBlack-Moon King smiled and responded by saying, \u201cNight River, would you like to make another wager?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else can we bet on?\u201d Night River King was shocked by the offer.\n\nTo see whether or not he can raise twenty-four moons,\u201d Black-Moon King said.\n\n\u201cBlack-Moon, it sounds to me as if you really admire the boy. Do you honestly believe he is that talented?\u201d Black River King looked at Black-Moon King with much surprise.\n\nYes, I do,\u201d Black-Moon responded.\n\n\u201cOkay. In that case, I will conduct this wager again, and I still want to compete for that Steel Knife of yours. What would you like?\u201d Night River King said quickly.\n\nBlack-Moon King slowly said, \u201cA Magic Steel.\u201d\n\nNight River King frowned, but he nodded. \u201cFine. Since you have Dragon Steel, it is pointless to hold onto Magic Steel. Assuming you win, you can take the Magic Steel if Han Sen is able to raise twenty-four moons.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Black-Moon King\u2019s lips were smiling.\n\nThe moons kept on rising, and before long, there were eighteen of them hanging in the sky.\n\n\u201cWow, there is now eighteen of them. He must be all tapped out by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, it is still continuing! He\u2019s at nineteen.\u201d \u201cInteresting. Can this guy really raise twenty-four moons?\u201d\n\nYisha was in a good mood, right now. It had been difficult getting him to evolve twice. But after that, she had been satisfied with every result following her expenditure. She was starting to think she had really lucked out by taking him on.\n\nBut thinking about how to get him to Viscount, Earl, Marquise, and then Duke was something that was giving Yisha a bit of a headache.\n\nThe Story of Genes\u2019 modifications had not gone well. If Han Sen practiced it, it\u2019d cost a lot of resources each and every time. Getting him to the level of a Baron had already been very hard, so she couldn\u2019t even comprehend how much it might cost her if she brought him all the way up to Duke.\n\nIcebird Duke was surprised Han Sen had been so lucky. He had eighteen moons now.\n\nThe tally of moons kept rising without slowing down. Eventually, Han Sen had reached the prestigious number of twenty-four.\n\n\u201cI lost.\u201d Night River King frowned. Han Sen\u2019s performance had surprised him a great deal.\n\nBut this was just the beginning. After the number twenty-four, another moon appeared in the skies above Moon Palace. \u201cD*mn! Another moon? Twenty-five? He broke the outsider record!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he insane?\u201d\n\n\u201cQueen really is sharp. He must be the luckiest outsider ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill rising\u2026 Twenty-six.\u201d Oh my god\u2026 Might he be a Rebate just pretending to be an outsider?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is insane! This number is the average of a\n\nRebate. Many of the Rebate can\u2019t even reach this far.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Moon God really fancies him.\u201d \u201cSh*t! Twenty-seven! Surely he cannot reach\n\nthirty-six.\u201d\n\nAfter all the moons that had risen, Narrow Moon was losing its stability. Many people stood up and stared at the Moon Palace.\n\n\u201cOh my god! Thirty!\u201d\n\nMany Nobles, like Night River King, Black-Moon King, and Yisha, were all shocked. No one had guessed that it was even possible for Han Sen to raise so many moons.\n\nThe Moon God\u2019s blessing wasn\u2019t normally very too powerful or beneficial, but when you reached that sort of number, the reinforcements turned into something special.\n\nAnother moon came up, and then Narrow Moon went quiet. It was the thirty-sixth. That was the highest any Rebate had ever been blessed with.\n\n\u201cHe really did raise thirty-six moons! He is totally a fake outsider.\u201d Many of the Rebate had wry smiles. They felt extremely jealous.\n\nThirty-six moons was a very rare number amongst the Rebate.\n\n\u201cHe is lucky.\u201d Moon Wheel King took a sip of tea and then let out a lengthy sigh.\n\nThe next second, he almost choked on the tea in his mouth.\n\nAbove the palace, another moon came up.\n\nThe whole of Narrow Moon was quiet. The Dukes, and everyone there, had their mouths open. And yet, no one spoke.\n\n\u201cImpossible.\u201d Night River King suddenly stood up. He stared at the Moon Palace\u2019s thirty-seventh moon.\n\nYisha was shocked, as well. Thirty-six plus one moon was something no Rebate had ever seen before, across a million years.\n\nEveryone thought thirty-six was the highest he could achieve, but what they had just witnessed told them that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nIcebird Duke wore a complex expression on her face. Her mouth was open wide, and she looked to be in disbelief.\n\n\u201cThis is madness\u2026\u201d\n\nMoon Palace now had thirty-seven moons overhead.\n\nSomeone couldn\u2019t help but scream.\n\nAll the Nobles felt very conflicted. Especially those of the Rebate. They were so proud of this festival, but now their pride in it was waning. The person who had been able to raise the most moons in the festival\u2019s history was no longer a Rebate.\n\nAnd that was just the start of the insanity. All the Nobles were shocked, confused, and also suspicious. Another moon arose in the sky."
