    "text": "Han Sen had three god personalities. They were the Destruction class Sky Armor God and Evil Lotus God, as well as the Annihilation class Kill Sky God.\n\nHan Sen went to Evil Lotus God\u2019s god temple. He wanted to see what type of armament Evil Lotus God\u2019s god personality armament was.\n\n\u201cWhy is Dollar here again? Did he not just kill Moment God?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he is a bloodthirsty mongrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what level of God Spirit he is challenging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be at least a Disaster class one. He killed a Disaster class Moment God, so there is no way he is challenging something of a lower level.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone was discussing it, Han Sen walked into Evil Lotus God\u2019s god temple. All the audience felt a little weird.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? Why is Dollar challenging a Destruction class God Spirit?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! That god temple must be shut down right now. He cannot challenge it. Why is he in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d After a while, everyone saw the god flag on the god temple start to shine. Before long, it went dim. The God Spirit must have been killed.\n\nHan Sen quickly came out from Evil Lotus God\u2019s god temple and went to Sky Armor God\u2019s god temple.\n\nThe same thing happened again. Han Sen quickly emerged from Sky Armor God\u2019s god temple.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! What is happening? Dollar can enter a shutdown god temple and slay the spirits inside? Is he cheating?\u201d\n\nOrdinary creatures did not know the difference between god temples and sealed temples. They were all frozen. \u201cHe is not leaving. Dollar is headed for the god temple upstairs. He is not going to challenge a disaster God Spirit again, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Dollar already challenged a Disaster class god temple group. He is still going up.\u201d \u201cDoes he want to challenge an Annihilation class God Spirit?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe went in. He really went in.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone was watching, Han Sen pushed open the shutdown Kill Sky God Temple. He walked inside. The god temple\u2019s door closed itself.\n\nLike the God Spirits that descended died outside the god temples, only someone holding the God Spirit\u2019s god personality can enter. Normal creatures did not kill descended God Spirits. They did not know this method to enter the god temple.\n\nBefore Han Sen entered Evil Lotus God and Sky Armor God\u2019s god temples, he killed the defenseless God Spirits inside. They did not have God Spirits, but he had received the god personality armaments. Evil Lotus God\u2019s god personality armament was a purple crystal lotus flower-shaped ring. Sky Armor God\u2019s god personality armament was a half-body armor. It was different from what Han Sen expected. He had been hoping for a weapon.\n\nHan Sen did not try out what kind of power those two god personality armaments wielded. He went to Kill Sky God Temple and saw Kill Sky God\u2019s empty shell god body standing atop the god altar. He looked very powerful but without anger.\n\nHan Sen already had the experience, so he knew it was just a useless empty shell that could not fight back.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes scanned Kill Sky God. If he wanted to kill a God Spirit, he had to destroy his god base. Otherwise, the God Spirit\u2019s healing power would have been too strong for him to destroy.\n\nEvil Lotus God was a low-level God Spirit. Han Sen was able to slash open his god body and find the god base with ease. An Annihilation class God Spirit like Kill Sky God was different. It wouldn\u2019t be as easy for him.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen saw Kill Sky God be killed by Wan\u2019er. He saw it clearly. He knew exactly where the god base was, which saved him a lot of trouble.\n\nHe was not going to use Super Spank this time. He was afraid of destroying everything and then not being able to claim the god personality armament. In the end, he summoned his Sky Vine Radish God Lance and pierced toward Kill Sky God\u2019s god body.\n\nThe Sky Vine Radish God Lance was thrust into the empty shell that was Kill Sky God\u2019s god body\u2019s chest. Sparks erupted everywhere. The strike only damaged his skin a bit. He did not even bleed.\n\n\u201cKill Sky God\u2019s real god body is stronger than the universe god body he used when he descended.\u201d Han Sen knew he would be unable to break a god base like that. He hesitated and summoned the Kirin\u2019s holy spirit. He made it possess the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. The Sky Vine Radish God Lance suddenly burned with white fire.\n\nHan Sen struck again. This time, the tip of the lance managed to perforate it a lot. It also ended up getting stuck within the muscles and bones.\n\nHan Sen thrust and thrust. He was busy for quite a while when he finally pierced through the blood and the bones inside. He saw the chest releasing a black and smoky heart. \u201cThat is it!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s thrust the heart. He noticed the heart was even harder than the god bones and god flesh that had kept it protected.\n\nHan Sen held the Sky Vine Radish God Lance and attacked it for half an hour before finally being able to pierce through the heart. He wiped away the sweat that had accumulated on his forehead and said, \u201cLuckily, that guy possessed someone when he descended to chase me. If he had used this god body to fight me, my fight would have been harder.\u201d After completely destroying the heart, Han Sen quickly brought out the Kill Sky God arm bone. The god body turned a light substance and headed toward Han Sen\u2019s own arm bone. It all went into his bones.\n\nThe black light of the bones grew stronger. It was floating inside Han Sen\u2019s hand. When all the light substance melted into his bones, the bone light looked dim. After the light was gone, Han Sen saw the arm bone become a black bone hammer.\n\nThe bone hammer was far too cruel. The hammer was just a bit bigger than a fist. It was like a rubber hammer in a house.\n\n\u201cWhy is this hammer so different when compared to the hammer Kill Sky God wielded? Kill Sky God\u2019s hammer was so much more powerful. What is this tiny thing for?\u201d Han Sen complained, but then an announcement played.\n\n\u201cAnnihilation class god personality armament received: Kill Sky Hammer.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the Kill Sky Hammer. The name was very powerful and overbearing, but it looked very small. It looked like a black bone hammer. The head was a cylinder. Both sides of the hammer head had a god symbol. It looked old and mysterious, but Han Sen did not know what the two god symbols meant.\n\nWhen he and Kill Sky God fought, the big hammer had those two god symbols too. They likely represented his power. Just like before, Kill Sky Hammer had a message in Han Sen\u2019s head. \u201cKill Sky Hammer Annihilation class god personality armament.\u201d\n\nSeeing Kill Sky God get resurrected, Han Sen did not dare remain. He put the Kill Sky Hammer into his Sea of Soul and swiftly departed Kill Sky God Temple. All the races of the universe were looking at the Kill Sky God Temple. They saw him emerge from the god temple right when the god flag flashed. Then, it went dim. Clearly, a God Spirit had died inside the god temple.\n\n\u201cReally? Dollar killed an Annihilation class God Spirit, and the temple was closed down. This seems fake to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he play like that?\u201d\n\nAll the creatures opened their eyes wide. They were not able to believe it.\n\nHan Sen had just exited the zone of the god temples when he saw Bai King floating in the air. He was laughing at him."
