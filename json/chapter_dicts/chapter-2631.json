    "text": "\u201cI am the greatest of my level.\u201d Suddenly, everyone felt very differently about the words that Han Sen had just spoken.\n\nExquisite\u2019s body hit the ground with a thump. When she rose to her feet, she did so like a shambling zombie. Her bloody face and broken nose had instantly returned to normal. She was as pretty as she had been before Han Sen\u2019s punch, and it didn\u2019t look as if she had sustained any injuries.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of geno art is that?\u201d Exquisite asked Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen had been able to increase his speed until he was faster than the manipulated universe. He had moved too quickly for her to even react. That wasn\u2019t something a ninth-tier King should have been able to achieve. Only a handful of half-deifieds could reach such a speed. Exquisite knew a few people who could accomplish this, but Han Sen wasn\u2019t on that short list. The ones she knew were all half-deified.\n\nYu Shanxin of Sky Palace was one such individual. He could move that quickly, but he used his Sky Eye and the Extreme Evil Path. Han Sen was just a crystallizer that couldn\u2019t use a Sky Eye.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a geno art. It was just a simple punch.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cSon of a b*tch. I am now buying into Han Sen\u2019s bluffing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! A random punch. Well said, Brother Han.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Very High is actually quite lame. She couldn\u2019t even withstand one of Brother Han\u2019s punches.\u201d\n\nMany of the students at Sky Palace were excited. None of them liked Exquisite much. They were all happy to insult her.\n\nYun Suyi couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWhat is wrong with Brother Han? Is he not capable of behaving humbly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has done what he should have. I never liked these Very High, anyway,\u201d Yun Sushang said.\n\nLone Bamboo didn\u2019t say anything. He merely smiled. The audience thought Han Sen was just trying to make Exquisite mad, but he knew Han Sen was speaking the truth. It really was just a simple punch.\n\nLone Bamboo had fought against Han Sen once before. Han Sen really was that fast. His fitness was so high, it would be difficult to find a half-deified that could equal him.\n\nLone Bamboo had become one with the Purple-Eye Butterfly, which was how his own fitness had increased to unbelievable levels. But if he was compared to Han Sen, he still fell far short.\n\nFour of Han Sen\u2019s geno arts had reached the ninth tier. His fitness had been reinforced four times. Ordinary ninth-tier Kings simply couldn\u2019t compete.\n\nEven if Han Sen didn\u2019t use his super god spirit body, his fitness was still better than others of the same level. By a wide margin, too. Against other Kings, Han Sen really did reign supreme. His talk about being the best of his league wasn\u2019t some baseless boast. After all, there were no other creatures that could experience the reinforcement of four geno arts the way Han Sen had. In addition, the geno arts he had focused on were amongst the best ever. With the fitness he wielded, he was still a bit weak against deified creatures, but Kings and half-deifieds were no longer a serious threat.\n\n\u201cThat was a simple punch? Then let me see how many simple punches you can throw.\u201d Although Exquisite was using her Very High Eye, she couldn\u2019t help but look a little angry.\n\nExquisite lifted her right arm and used the edge of her hand like a knife. With it, she tried slashing toward Han Sen. Everyone immediately realized that she was using Han Sen\u2019s own skill; this was Fang.\n\nThe students of Sky Palace were in shock. Teeth Knife wasn\u2019t an insanely good skill, but it was the Rebate\u2019s secret geno art. Practicing it required the body of a Rebate.\n\nIt was remarkable that Han Sen was able to use it, but after all, he was Yisha\u2019s only student. Somehow, Exquisite was able to use Teeth Knife, too. When she used it, the purple Teeth air shredded space. She was wielding the skill with more power than Han Sen\u2019s usage had possessed.\n\nExquisite had been in Sky Palace for a year. She hadn\u2019t been lazy during that time. Teeth Knife wasn\u2019t a secret to the Very High, and she had spent time practicing it to achieve a very high proficiency with it.\n\nWhen Exquisite used her Very High Eye, the entire universe would work to help her. Her knifemind wasn\u2019t as good as Han Sen\u2019s, but the power in her strikes was above the Teeth Knife Han Sen had used earlier.\n\nHan Sen saw the tearing space power coming toward him. The knife air was like the real, raging purple air of a dragon\u2019s maw. Still, his expression didn\u2019t change. Running The Story of Genes at maximum, he used his own body to throw a punch toward the purple knife air.\n\nAs everyone gaped in astonishment, Han Sen\u2019s punch broke the knife air that was raging toward him. His counterattack didn\u2019t stop there, though. It flew all the way back to Exquisite and pounded her knife-hand.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe sound of breaking bones crunched audibly throughout the arena. The thin bones in Exquisite\u2019s hand were shattered by Han Sen\u2019s fist. His punch was still unstoppable, and it continued toward Exquisite\u2019s chest.\n\nExquisite\u2019s face had turned white, but she was able to react instantly. She used God\u2019s Wander to disappear from in front of Han Sen.\n\nBut Han Sen was waiting for her to appear again. When she reappeared, Han Sen\u2019s fist was still heading straight toward her.\n\nEveryone\u2019s mouths opened wide. They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.\n\nEven Sky Palace Leader looked stunned. After a while, he said, \u201cNot bad. He is as good as I was when I was younger.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s much stronger than you when you were young,\u201d the woman said. She didn\u2019t feel bad about the critique.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I was stronger than a tiger. I was crueler than a wolf,\u201d Sky Palace Leader tried to explain.\n\nBefore he was finished, the woman cut him off. \u201cCould you bully a student of the Very High like this when you were younger?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 I did beat them\u2026\u201d Sky Palace Leader coughed. \u201cThere is a big difference between \u2018beating\u2019 and \u2018bullying,\u201d the woman said with a roll of her eyes.\n\nHan Sen was playing with Exquisite like a cat with a mouse.\n\nIn front of that absolute power and speed, Exquisite\u2014who had previously looked like some sort of god\u2014was being used as a punching bag. Her bones were breaking one by one, and she couldn\u2019t maintain her regal appearance.\n\nExquisite used all kinds of geno arts as she tried to fight back, but her efforts were wasted. Han Sen\u2019s speed and power completely suppressed her. She couldn\u2019t dodge. She couldn\u2019t counterattack. Aside from getting pummeled, there was nothing she could do.\n\nHan Sen was like an enraged tyrannosaurus rex right now. He ignored Exquisite\u2019s attacks and allowed her powers to come down on him. Her attacks made slight marks on Spell\u2019s armor, but they disappeared quickly after.\n\nEvery one of Han Sen\u2019s punches hit Exquisite, though. Every bone in her body broke under the onslaught. Blood gushed out of her mouth uncontrollably.\n\nIf she had been fighting someone ordinary, she could have used God\u2019s Wander to protect her body. Things would have gone much better for her.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s alter ego had already learned God\u2019s Wander. Each time she disappeared, he just needed to calculate and predict where Exquisite was going to pop back into reality.\n\nPlus, the arena was quite small. There wasn\u2019t much room for her to teleport around. Han Sen could easily determine where she was going to show up next. Pang!\n\nExquisite\u2019s body hit the dome of the arena again, and the shield flickered and shimmered under the impact. When she landed on the ground in a heap, Exquisite remained where she was and didn\u2019t try to get back up again. She looked at Han Sen with astonishment.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t believe it. Her Very High Eye was active, but she was completely suppressed by another of the same level. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t fight back."
