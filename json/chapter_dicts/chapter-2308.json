    "text": "Han Sen and Bai Wei spent a few hours waiting atop the golden king dragon. The king dragon still hadn\u2019t gone underground when a few men approached them. That made Bai Wei feel rather nervous.\n\nBecause Han Sen\u2019s eyes were better than Bai Wei\u2019s, he knew exactly who was coming. The sight made him frown.\n\nThe leader of the group was none other than Prince Fourteen Bai Canglang. The people following him had to be his Royal Guards. There were four of them: two of the Lane race, one Ghana, and one female of the Extreme King.\n\nThe four guards had an intimidating aura. They had to be at least King class, and on top of that, the female Extreme King was familiar to Han Sen. When Han Sen looked closer, however, he realized that he didn\u2019t actually know her.\n\n\u201cBrother Fourteen!\u201d When Bai Wei saw Bai Canglang, her face paled. She was too weak to compete with Bai Canglang, and she knew it.\n\nBai Wei walked up to him and bowed. \u201cGreetings, Brother Fourteen.\u201d\n\nBai Canglang looked at Bai Wei. He waved his hand. \u201cSince you now have access to the King\u2019s Garden, you are nothing but a competitor to me. There is no need for you to remain so polite.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bai Canglang glanced over her shoulder, his eyes barely flicking to Han Sen before returning to Bai Wei. He coldly said, \u201cBut you are my little sister. As a big brother, I shouldn\u2019t be the one to bully you. Choose one of these four knights. If you can withstand one of their blows, you can keep this primary root king dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Fourteen, you must be kidding. If you want it, just take it. We can go and find another king dragon.\u201d Bai Wei bowed and readied herself to depart.\n\nBai Canglang stepped over and grabbed Bai Wei by the arm. He smiled, showing his teeth. \u201cSister Wei, don\u2019t think so little of yourself. You are in the King\u2019s Garden! You cannot avoid a little healthy competition. You should get used to it, sooner rather than later. But don\u2019t worry, Brother Fourteen won\u2019t steal your king dragon. I just want you to understand how you are expected to survive here in the King\u2019s Garden.\u201d\n\nBai Wei forced a smile. \u201cThank you, Brother Fourteen. I don\u2019t dare to overstep my bounds, though. I don\u2019t want to fight with anyone, and I would much prefer a stable existence here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fine. Win or lose, you can have this primary root king dragon.\u201d Bai Canglang was still holding onto her arm as he spoke to her.\n\nA primary root king dragon was nothing to a prince like Bai Canglang. If he did not take this one, it would be easy for him to find another.\n\nBai Canglang was forcing Bai Wei into this position because of Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen to know that following Bai Wei was a big mistake.\n\nHan Sen saw that Bai Canglang had grabbed Bai Wei\u2019s arm and was keeping her there. So, he walked over smoothly and bowed to Bai Wei.\n\n\u201cIf you insist, Prince Fourteen, then I am willing to do this for my queen.\u201d\n\nBai Wei was about to say something, but Bai Canglang had started speaking already. \u201cAh, you are Knife Queen\u2019s student indeed! So brave. I greatly admire brave individuals like you. Please pick one of the four guards next to me. Whether you withstand the attack or not, you will still keep this king dragon.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bai Canglang turned to the four guards in his company. \u201cHan Sen is Knife Queen\u2019s student. I am good friends with Knife Queen. You guys cannot hurt her student too much, so please don\u2019t go overkill with your powers. Okay?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the four guards and hesitated. He went to the Extreme King female guard and said, \u201cIf you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cRed Sleeve, do not hurt him,\u201d Bai Canglang said firmly to the female guard.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the female guard answered. She walked in front of Canglang to stand directly before Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI am Han Sen. What is your name?\u201d Han Sen greeted the female guard.\n\nIt didn\u2019t really matter which guard he selected. Every single one there was a higher level than him.\n\nHe had selected her simply because he thought she seemed familiar. He just couldn\u2019t remember where he might have seen her before. By doing this, he hoped to jog his memory and confirm his sense of familiarity.\n\n\u201cRed Sleeve,\u201d the female guard answered shortly. She raised her fist and said, \u201cIf you can take my punch without falling, then you win.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the fist started to glow with light. The light was like a moon, and wherever the moon shone, the fabric of space twisted.\n\nHan Sen shifted his body a little. He felt as if the area around him was being stretched. After he moved his body, he was still where he had been.\n\n\u201cSpace powers?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nRed Sleeve\u2019s fist hurtled toward him. It was like a moon falling. Han Sen moved, but her powers seemed to be locking him in place. And that moon was coming closer.\n\nHan Sen squinted and looked at that coming moon. If he couldn\u2019t dodge, then he wasn\u2019t going to dodge. He lifted a fist and punched towards the moon.\n\nBai Wei looked ill. Red Sleeve was a King class elite. She might have even been half deified. Han Sen, on the other hand, had only just become a Duke. No matter how strong he was, there was no way he could fight Red Sleeve in such a manner.\n\nBai Wei knew exactly what Bai Canglang was up to with all these theatrics. If Han Sen took this punch, he would be seriously injured, if not killed outright.\n\nPang!\n\nAt that moment, Red Sleeve\u2019s fist came into contact with Han Sen\u2019s own fist. The moon shattered like glass, and the space nearby also broke, cracks running through reality around Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nBai Wei was stunned. She had been sure that Red Sleeve wouldn\u2019t dare kill anyone inside King\u2019s Garden, but the woman had exerted her power with the obvious intent to kill. Han Sen\u2019s body had been annihilated by space power. Unless Han Sen had a very strong revival power, he wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to recover over time; living was no longer possible.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was ripped open. His form then exploded like water, scattering everywhere.\n\nBut then, another image of Han Sen became visible in exactly the same place that he had previously stood. He was in perfect condition, and he was just standing there. The Han Sen that the moon had wrecked was just a doppelganger built using the Moon technique.\n\n\u201cI am useless. Please punish me, my prince!\u201d Red Sleeve looked horrified. She bowed before Bai Canglang to apologize.\n\n\u201cHan Sen\u2019s doppelganger technique is amazing. It even fooled me. In that case, I couldn\u2019t expect you to have seen through it.\u201d Bai Canglang waved his hand and gestured for her to fall back. He smiled to Han Sen. \u201cYou are better than your teacher. It is no wonder that you are Knife Queen\u2019s student. I am so close with your teacher. If you have time, you should come and visit me.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bai Canglang told Bai Wei, \u201cSister Wei, I am so happy that you managed to enlist such a good guard. You can have this primary root king dragon. I am going to look for another. I will see you later.\u201d\n\nAfter Bai Canglang left, Bai Wei spoke to Han Sen. \u201cThat was way too risky. You almost died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am fine, though, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Han Sen laughed. As he turned his gaze back to Bai Canglang, an expression of deep thought crossed his face."
