    "text": "Without hesitation, Han Sen followed the waves of the sea. He flew in the direction they were coming from. He didn\u2019t dare to teleport, though. He merely reduced his presence as much as he could and flew slowly.\n\nBecause teleportation caused ripples in the fabric of space, elites were likely to pick up on such a technique if he used it. That could allow the people he was tailing to notice his presence, which he was trying very hard to avoid advertising. It was better for Han Sen to fly in as slowly and quietly as he could. He wouldn\u2019t draw as much attention that way.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\n\nExplosions sounded one after another. The strong shockwaves they emitted let Han Sen confirm that it really was the power of Break Six Skies. He had practiced Break Six Skies before, but he had never used it to create anything as powerful as the shockwaves that were now rolling by him. Whoever was using Break Six Skies right now was far stronger than he was, that was for sure.\n\n\u201cAre those giants really Breakskies? What are they doing here?\u201d Han Sen was growing more and more suspicious of this whole situation. He wanted to teleport forward to get there with greater haste and see what they were doing.\n\nThe hyper scary Break Six Skies shockwaves might have suggested an obscenely dangerous battle was going on, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t feel any other powers or geno arts being used. If the giants were fighting some other group, Han Sen should have been able to detect some evidence of foreign powers.\n\n\u201cAre the giants killing each other, maybe?\u201d Although Han Sen wanted to find out the truth, he still remained patient and flew forward slowly. He was careful not to rush.\n\nThe sea sloshed and danced like mad with the energy that was being released. Han Sen flew between the wild waves, figuring they were a perfect opportunity to hide and remain out of sight.\n\nThis sea was unimaginably weird. Han Sen had flown for dozens of miles, yet he hadn\u2019t seen a single piece of seaweed or ocean creature. This sea was like distilled water, manmade, and without a single speck of bacteria.\n\nThe palaces that floated on the surface were now far behind Han Sen. He had passed 300 of them as he flew forward, but that seemed to be all that there were.\n\n\u201cIf each palace contained a giant, then that means there are 300 giants here. That is so many defied elites! That\u2019s almost as glorious as the legends I\u2019ve heard of Sacred. What kind of people could have trapped these guys?\u201d Han Sen was growing increasingly worried about this strange situation he had stumbled into.\n\nEventually, Han Sen saw a big mountain appear over the horizon. That mountain quickly swelled to block his vision as he flew toward it. It looked massive.\n\nThe giants, who were possibly Breakskies, had gathered at the foothills of the mountain. They were all swinging their fists to wallop the mountain.\n\nHan Sen had been waiting for this moment. The shockwaves of their blows rushed over him, and he confirmed the nature of the power. It really was Break Six Skies.\n\nBut what surprised Han Sen was that they weren\u2019t fighting. They were using Break Six Skies to excavate the rocks of the mountain.\n\nThree hundred giants, all in tight manacles, were like prisoners condemned to a mining camp. They punched the mountain, breaking away pieces of rock with a slow, steady rhythm.\n\nThe mountain looked grey, and Han Sen had no idea what sort of stone it was. Even though the giants were unleashing an insane amount of power as they worked, they only created a hole the size of one of their fists with each strike.\n\nThe 300 giants swung their fists with the implacability of machines, but the mountain was simply too massive. When the giants\u2019 progress was measured against the immensity of their task, it was obvious that they were barely making any headway.\n\n\u201cWhat are these guys doing? It isn\u2019t as if they\u2019re collecting the stones. Their punches are pretty much destroying the rocks, so they can\u2019t be after the stone itself.\u201d Han Sen eyed the mountain curiously.\n\nHan Sen continued flying, checking out the nearby area. Aside from that huge mountain and 300 giants, Han Sen didn\u2019t see anything else of note. There was just water in every direction.\n\nHan Sen inched closer to the mountain, but he did not dare get too close. He was worried there might be creatures lurking about that he couldn\u2019t detect.\n\nHe spent a while watching the giants, but even after a considerable amount of time, he couldn\u2019t understand what the giants were doing.\n\n\u201cAre these guys the heirs of Yu Gong? Are all of his children here, moving this mountain? Or does the mountain possess some kind of treasure?\u201d Han Sen wondered with interest.\n\nHan Sen examined the mountain more closely. God knew how long the 300 giants had been working there. They had only removed a small part of the mountain\u2019s foothills. If they were trying to make a tunnel, it would take years.\n\n\u201cThe way they\u2019re striking seems like they\u2019re trying to move the mountain, not dig into the side of it,\u201d Han Sen thought with a frown. He decided that he should fly around the mountain. Perhaps he could find some piece of text carved into the mountain, or really anything that might shed light on this baffling situation.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t flown very far around the mountain when his eyes widened. He came to an abrupt stop.\n\nA giant metal pillar had been pushed into the side of the mountain. It looked something like the Sky God Pillar, actually.\n\nEven more strangely, the metal pillar had been rammed through the chest of a giant. It was pinning him to the mountain.\n\nThat giant looked stronger than the other 300 Breakskies that Han Sen had seen so far. Its armor was crusted with dull, dried blood. Its blood-matted white hair looked like a waterfall, but it also obscured the giant\u2019s face. What did he look like? Han Sen had no idea.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t sense a lifeforce within this massive creature, but he could definitely sense a presence. It was hard to describe. When Han Sen looked at the giant, he felt numb. Goosebumps flared across his skin.\n\nThe giant was a dead man pinned to a mountain, but Han Sen felt as if his presence could break the sun and the moon. It was like the sky and the ground would be forced to obey this monster.\n\n\u201cHow can a dead man have this much power? How strong had he once been, then?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s shock quickly gave way to confusion. \u201cAre these giants trying to move the mountain so they can bring this body down? That is so stupid. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to dig around the lance itself? If they follow their current path, they\u2019ll have to dig through almost the entire mountain in order to bring the body down.\u201d\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t understand what the giants were thinking, and so he continued soaring around the mountain to see if he could find anything else.\n\nHe ended up disappointed. He flew around the mountain, but aside from the pillar and the giant corpse pinned to the mountain, there was nothing else to find.\u201cThe giants have to be after that body, but the way they\u2019re digging into the rocks makes no sense. There must be a reason why they cannot bring the body down right away,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen spent a long time watching them from afar. The giants kept using their fists to shatter stone. They did it would reprieve.\n\nHan Sen made a calculation. At their current speed, it would take more than ten thousand years for them to bring the whole mountain down.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong!\n\nThe bells in the sky rang again. Han Sen raised his head. The three needles were pointing north again. That meant it was 12 o\u2019clock.\n\nUpon hearing the bell, the giants striking the mountain stopped their work. They all turned and headed back the way they had come.\n\nWhen the giants were gone, Han Sen saw something unbelievable."
