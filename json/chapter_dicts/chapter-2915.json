    "text": "\u201cIf our purpose is the same, why don\u2019t we cooperate? We can avoid conflict and risk less. What do you think?\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked like he never became mad. He always spoke quietly.\n\n\u201cCooperate? How would you like to cooperate, Grandmaster?\u201d Han Sen was shocked, but this was perfect for him. He did not know anything. If he was able to get some information from Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others, it was not a bad thing to pursue.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what your purpose is.\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster smiled.\n\n\u201cAncient Abyss Grandmaster is such an old fox.\u201d Han Sen knew it would be impossible to get information out of him. He looked at the direction he wanted to go and said, \u201cI do not know what Grandmaster\u2019s purpose is either. With things being that way, I believe we should just go our separate ways.\u201d\n\nAfter saying that, Han Sen turned around and started going in the direction he wanted to.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster did not stop him. He followed him, smiled, and said, \u201cIf we are sharing the same road, we should at least go together. We can look after each other. If something bad happens to us, perhaps we can cooperate in those moments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not own this path. If you want to go, Grandmaster, that is up to you.\u201d Han Sen ignored Ancient Abyss and the others. He took Bao\u2019er with him to fly away.\n\nAncient Abyss and the four Extreme King deifieds followed. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was a rare character. Even if the Extreme King and Han Sen were hostile, he was being surprisingly pleasant to Han Sen.\n\nIt was not like Han Sen loved talking to him. It was just that Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was very intelligent and knew how to socialize with people. While he was talking to Han Sen, it was like he was talking to an old friend. It did not make him feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe things he talked about, along with the way he spoke, made people very interested. When spoken by him, something that was very normal seemed very interesting. It propagated an allure and desire to hear more.\n\nOn the road, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster introduced to him the things they encountered. Han Sen and Bao\u2019er found it very interesting. He could not avoid talking to him. The atmosphere was quite pleasant. It was like they were a bunch of friends going on a hike.\n\nThe more Han Sen thought about it, the things Ancient Abyss Grandmaster discussed did not help him out at all. Han Sen really admired that.\n\nThe more a person talked, the more at risk they were at leaking information they shouldn\u2019t. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, however, despite flapping his gums for the longest amount of time, did not let a single thing slip. It made people feel very comfortable and that he was not being pushy. That was not something normal people could do.\n\n\u201cAncient Abyss Grandmaster is a very special character.\u201d Han Sen was now on higher alert.\n\nIt was not scary to make enemies. It was scary when one had an enemy standing in front of them, but the enemy made them feel comfortable and at ease. Although he made it known he was the enemy, the hostile thoughts were less frequent. That was the scariest kind of enemy.\n\nThe group of people flew for 10 days. Han Sen was given loads of universal knowledge from Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. He learned about the legends of Sacred and many more myths.\n\nHan Sen suddenly saw an area that looked like a landfill. Many universal trash heaps were floating about. It was like an endless sea of trash.\n\nWhile overlooking the sea of trash, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said, \u201cThis place is very close to the Sacred core area back then. If we keep going this way, time and space will be all messed up. All kinds of energies and chaotic forces swell here. Plus, all the xenogeneics here are top class. Even a true god elite would feel under pressure in a place like this. If you want to proceed, you should be very careful. Plus, you are taking a child along with you. You should be doubly careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this time, we have yet to encounter a single xenogeneic. I say this big barren system is not as scary as the legends claim.\u201d Han Sen only feigned his ignorance.\n\nWith a serious look, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster reminded him, \u201cPlease, do not be so reckless. The reason why we can travel here safely is that an elite has come here before us. He has cleared the dangers that were here. It will not be the same if we proceed. Even the true god class elite could not clear out all the dangers ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, really? Do you know who the elite ahead of us is, Grandmaster?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d Ancient Abyss shook his head. \u201cThey have deliberately erased the traces of their coming. Although you can still follow a trail, you cannot identify whose it was. That is something to worry about. I hope you will be careful about all this and not bring harm to that child.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for the reminder, Grandmaster. If it is that dangerous, I will not proceed. I think I will go elsewhere.\u201d Han Sen bowed to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. \u201cGrandmaster, thank you for taking care of us. We appreciate it. I guess we will part ways here. Let\u2019s hope we meet again.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen carried Bao\u2019er and traveled to another side of the trash sea. He understood that Ancient Abyss Grandmaster had not only told him all he had as a simple reminder to be careful. It was a sign of refusal.\n\nIt was supposed to mean that the way forward was too dangerous, and they should not have trusted each other. It was not very nice if they were to go on together.\n\nHan Sen understood what he meant, so he chose to leave.\n\nAfter Han Sen was gone, an Extreme King deified elite looked toward where Han Sen departed and asked, \u201cMister Grandmaster, do you think Han Sen is here for that?\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster shook his head. \u201cIt is hard to say, but where he is going is possibly where we are headed too.\u201d\n\nAnother deified elite quietly asked, \u201cDo you think we should take him out first?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said.\n\n\u201cIf we do not do it now and reach that place, he has a weird geno art that can prove troublesome to us,\u201d a deified elite said.\n\n\u201cThat is fine. Although his geno arts are strange, I have a way to break them. Do not worry.\u201d After pausing, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster looked in the direction Han Sen left and squinted his eyes. \u201cMaybe he will even be able to help us.\u201d\n\nHan Sen followed the outskirts of the trash sea for a while. He stopped when he was no longer able to see Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others. He looked around. The trash sea appeared endless. He had no idea how big it was.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go in from here,\u201d Han Sen said to Bao\u2019er, who was perched on his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you run off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er has been good,\u201d Bao\u2019er said as she blinked her eyes. \u201cI have not run off.\u201d"
