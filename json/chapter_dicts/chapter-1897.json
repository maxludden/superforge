    "text": "\u201cSky Mind like knife. What does that mean?\u201d Qing Li held the wood board and wrote down the four words. She looked at Han Sen with a modicum of confusion. She knew the four words, but she did not understand the meaning of their combination.\n\n\u201cGo home and look it over. When you understand it, you can write it. And when you can write it, I will take you as a student.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cAs long as I am able to write out those four words, you can accept me as a student? That simply?\u201d Qing Li did not believe Han Sen. Copying out four words to pass a test was far too easy.\n\n\u201cYes, it is that simple. Now, go and practice. But I have a rule for you to follow, and that is, you cannot ask for the aid of others. You have to write this out by yourself. If you get help to do this, then you forfeit.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nThose four words were simple, but copying them was not easy.\n\nThe words Han Sen wrote contained the Teeth Knife knifemind. The words could be copied, yes, but the feelings they elicited could not.\n\nHe gave Qing Li this task because he wanted her to give up in her pursuit. That being said, if she did understand the meaning behind the text and could copy it as she had been instructed, then she\u2019d be something of a genius. No one would mind taking on such a student, if that was the case.\n\n\u201cOkay, you said that. No regrets now.\u201d Qing Li was too young, and Han Sen thought she was too naive. She didn\u2019t understand the real task that she had been given.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t have any.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nQing Li left for home quite merrily with the wooden board. She planned to write down four beautiful words for Han Sen, so he\u2019d have no choice but to accept her as a student.\n\nWhen she was back home, she could not wait to start practicing.\n\nRebate generally took their education seriously, but Qing Li was an exception to that rule. She studied, but she didn\u2019t focus on it too much. She\u2019d finish any homework she was given, but she wouldn\u2019t go the extra mile with practice.\n\nIt was fortunate that Flower King was good at teaching and that he had forced her to practice some writing.\n\nQing Li\u2019s writing was not the best, but it wasn\u2019t too bad, either. If this was just writing, Qing Li had a chance.\n\nBut when Qing Li started to write out the words Han Sen had given to her, she felt rather strange. And that was because she was unable to write them out like he had. When she started, she thought they looked similar, but the further she went, the more she realized they drifted apart.\n\n\u201cWeird! Why is this happening?\u201d Qing Li held up the wooden boards to investigate. It was then that she realized the words were changing.\n\nThey weren\u2019t exactly changing, though. It was because the markings on the board were getting deeper, and the words elicited the feeling of them changing. It was as if the text could move.\n\n\u201cTeeth powers.\u201d Qing Li immediately realized that the words Han Sen had written out contained the power of Teeth. Teeth powers were breaking the wood; that was what was happening.\n\nBut no matter what, this would not scare Qing Li away. It actually flared her curiosity and her urge to go on. She swore to her god that she\u2019d write it all out, if it was the last thing she did.\n\nThis time, Qing Li tried her hardest. She kept trying to write down Han Sen\u2019s words and practicing the knife skills at the same time.\n\nAs the daughter of Flower King, many teachers would be willing to teach her if she was willing to learn writing and knife skills. Plus, Flower King had a wide collection of writing techniques, and she was a naturally smart woman. So, it should not have been too difficult.\n\nIt was hard to learn writing in such a short time. But the added pressure made her focus more. The more she watched Han Sen\u2019s words, the more fascinating she found them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because of how well they were written, though. It was because the knifemind was so strong.\n\nAs Qing Li looked into the writings and the knife skills, she realized that the four words were really unpredictable. The more she wrote, the less she found herself following. She was starting to think she couldn\u2019t practice it at all.\n\nPat!\n\nAfter ten days, the wooden board cracked. The knifemind and the Teeth powers broke the boards. And then, the four words disappeared.\n\nQing Li was shocked. She understood that this was the time limit given to her by Han Sen. She felt depressed. She had failed to copy them down, and on top of that, they were now broken. She had failed the test.\n\n\u201cQing Li, why have you been hiding yourself away at home for so many days? The event is going to start!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice sounded from the outside, and then she pushed the door open.\n\nThe person who entered was a Rebate woman the same age as Qing Li. Her name was Du Lishe. She was Moon Wheel King\u2019s daughter, and they were members of Moon Garden. They were also best friends.\n\nQing Li was an outgoing person. But she had been hiding away at home for ten days, and she hadn\u2019t gone looking for her friends once. Du Lishe was curious about what was going on, and so, she came looking for her friend.\n\n\u201cThe Buddha is already here. Why don\u2019t you come take a look? Why are you hiding at home?\u201d Du Lishe asked.\n\n\u201cAh, you are practicing writing? Did Uncle Flower force you to?\u201d Du Lishe saw writing all around the place. She picked up one and went on to say, \u201cThe words aren\u2019t bad. You have definitely improved.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather did not force me. I wanted to practice this myself!\u201d Qing Li shook her head.\n\n\u201cThat is strange! You are practicing writing out of choice. That\u2019s not your style at all. What made you take this up?\u201d Du Lishe looked at Qing Li with surprise.\n\nQing Li looked depressed and said, \u201cYou know I admire the queen? Well, I want to be her student. But she said that I am not qualified enough to learn Teeth Knife, and so she did not accept me as a student.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. But that was a long time ago. Is this still on your mind?\u201d Du Lishe said.\n\nQing Li shook her head. \u201cQueen is my idol, and that\u2019ll never change. So, I thought that if I could not have her as a teacher, I would become the student of her student. Then, that would make me her student\u2019s student. It can\u2019t be all that different, can it?\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Flower King is becoming Han Sen\u2019s student? Even if you wanted to obey him, I doubt he\u2019d take you.\u201d\n\nDu Lishe smiled.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t reject me. He wanted me to write down four words. If I do them successfully, he\u2019ll take me as a student,\u201d Qing Li said.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been practicing how to write this the entire time?\u201d Du Lishe saw that all she had written were sky mind like knife.\n\n\u201cYeah, I have been practicing for so long, and yet I still fail!\u201d Qing Li felt depressed.\n\n\u201cHow can it be so difficult? Let me see.\u201d Du Lishe was curious about this.\n\nQing Li shook her head. \u201cThe text is gone.\u201d"
