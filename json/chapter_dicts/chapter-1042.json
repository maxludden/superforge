This is indeed the Phoenix Eye,\u201d Brother Seven reaffirmed.\n\n\u201cThen where\u2019s the treasure?\u201d Han Sen saw a mountain range in the distance, which only told him this place was massive. Locating anything there might be far more difficult than expected.\n\nBrother Seven looked back at his compass. He said, \u201cThis is strange. I cannot tell which direction we must go now.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven touched the black grass on the ground, and when he looked at his hand, it was covered in black soot. The ground really was like charcoal. Then, he said, \u201cI have no idea whatsoever what purpose this place serves, in a shelter, but I am certain some power presides over this place. A dangerous presence remains, one that keeps this world like one that was built from charcoal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best we don\u2019t split up,\u201d Han Sen said, as he looked around.\n\nBrother Seven nodded, and he knew Han Sen would protect him.\n\nHan Sen was not very proficient when it came to discovering paths and going in the right direction, so he allowed Brother Seven to lead.\n\nAlthough Brother Seven was just as clueless about where the treasure might be found, he was good at planning routes.\n\nAs they walked, the landscape remained the same. The mountain, trees, and flowers were all still black.\n\nThere was great variation in the size and shape of the flowers and trees. There were thick, giant trees, and lots of tiny little flowers. Black as they were, they looked like motionless statues. They looked as if they could never die, and they\u2019d be preserved in this state forever.\n\nBao\u2019er thought the flowers looked incredibly pretty, and she wanted to hold one. But upon being allowed to touch one, the flower quickly collapsed into a mound of soot.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of power can incinerate things like this?\u201d Han Sen was quite surprised.\n\nBrother Seven could only say, \u201cI have no idea, but if we encounter whatever has done this, we are sure to meet a swift end. Rather than cooked, I\u2019d wager we\u2019d be vaporized.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not expect Brother Seven to be so light-hearted, and of a mood to actually make half a jest.\n\nBut suddenly, they heard a noise coming from a distant black forest.\n\nWhen they tracked down the noise, they saw a white ram, grazing on the black grass of a meadow.\n\nThe contrast between the white ram and black earth was striking.\n\n\u201cThere are creatures here?\u201d Han Sen was moderately relieved, upon coming to learn this.\n\nThe place had previously felt like a warped, alternate dimension. Seeing something else alive there made the place feel a little more real.\n\nIf this was all a hallucination, however, whoever created it had to be a supremely powerful being.\n\nBut if it was real, as he hoped, then at least he could use his powers.\n\nBao\u2019er, seeing the fluffy ram, quickly ran over to it. She leapt onto its back and grabbed its horns\u2014she looked exuberantly happy.\n\nThe ram was alarmed by its sudden mounting, and it took off running into the forest.\n\nHan Sen quickly gave chase, as the last thing he wanted right now was to lose Bao\u2019er. If he lost her now, it\u2019d be difficult to find her again.\n\nHan Sen guessed the ram was a mutant creature, and his hypothesis was correct. He and Brother Seven caught up with the ram with ease, and when they did, Han Sen grabbed the creature by its head.\n\nThe ram went soft and fell to the ground, with Bao\u2019er clapping.\n\nBrother Seven wished to say something, but his face immediately changed.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, let go of the ram,\u201d Brother Seven pleaded with anxiety.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and turned to look at what had startled Brother Seven.\n\nThere were many more rams and sheep approaching. Their numbers had to be in the hundreds, and they all looked displeased and hostile.\n\nThe first ram they saw was fairly small in comparison to these others. Their horns were massive and sharp like blades.\n\nThe first ram was a mutant creature, but Han Sen guessed the others had to be sacred-blood creatures. With their power, all combined, they\u2019d make for frightening foes.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fitness was only equivalent to that of a sacred-blood creature, so he could easily find himself skewered and trampled to death if he did not use super king spirit mode.\n\n\u201cYou guys have cute children! I was just giving this one a hug; I wasn\u2019t being rough\u2026\u201d Han Sen started to stroke the mutant ram\u2019s head, and helped it get back up to its feet.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to incite the ire and fury of the rams. To survive a stampede by those wooly fiends, he\u2019d have to use super king spirit mode. But it was a draining talent, and he only sought to use it during the times where he absolutely had to. Not knowing what lay further ahead on this journey, too, he favored not making use of it now.\n\nThe hundreds of rams and sheep then baa\u2019d with rage.\n\nThe rams started to rush towards Han Sen like a legion of superspeed tanks.\n\nHan Sen grabbed Brother Seven and took off into the air in flight.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want Brother Seven to get hurt, so he thought it best to take the man to a safer spot before deciding what to do next.\n\nBut unfortunately for them, the rams were able to jump fifty meters high.\n\nHan Sen swooped through the air like a bird, effortlessly evading the airborne attacks of the rams. He may have been safe and out of their reach, but the rams followed wherever he flew. And as they went, a chorus of baa\u2019ing constantly sounded.\n\nThe rams were very powerful, and they each had to be sacred-blood in class.\n\nHan Sen initially believed losing their pursuit would be easy, but he was quickly proven wrong. And as he tried to escape, he noticed the white rams and sheep were starting to turn black.\n\nThe rams and sheep that banded together to assault Han Sen once looked like a cloud that was chasing him, but now, they were all black like an oversized chip of charcoal.\n\nIt was clear to see their speed and power had increased, following their change in color. But suddenly, Han Sen heard another sheep bawl.\n\nThere was a black male ram that looked different than the others coming. It ran and leapt towards Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSuper creature?!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face changed."
