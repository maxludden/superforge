    "text": "That fight was destined to become a legend in the geno universe. Before the day was out, the battle was being discussed across the universe.\n\nIt was amazing that Lando had defeated and tamed the Tianxia Unicorn, but Han Sen\u2019s actions had stolen the show. Han Sen had somehow turned Lando into a deified mid-fight.\n\nBefore that day, Han Sen was just a King of little fame. In the vast universe filled with strange and incredible powers, he wasn\u2019t very special. If he hadn\u2019t killed Bai Yi and ended up being chased by the Extreme King, many people wouldn\u2019t have known who he was.\n\nEven if he was a fugitive, he was still just a King. Few people would have said that there was anything special about him.\n\nBut after this fight, he became known as the Leader of all Gods. On any other day, the fact that such a name was used to refer to a mere King would have been very strange.\n\nSome wise guys even gave Han Sen the title Daddy of Gods.\n\nBut that title was only used in secret. If any deified heard it, they probably would have found it annoying. No one wanted to jeopardize their own life by irritating a deified.\n\nRegardless of that, the battle made Han Sen very famous. Everyone in the geno universe knew about him now, and so no one treated him as a measly King anymore.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t deified, but most people thought he was more mysterious than a deified.\n\nThere was nothing he could do about it, though. After all, he had been able to produce a deified. He didn\u2019t earn the name Daddy of Gods for nothing. Recent events had clearly established that he was different from most people.\n\nMany deifieds and the leaders of the higher races knew that Han Sen couldn\u2019t just flip a switch to make someone deified, though. They suspected that there were more factors involved in Lando becoming deified.\n\nBut they still had a keen interest in Han Sen. Even if Han Sen couldn\u2019t produce a deified, he had undoubtedly influenced Lando\u2019s evolution. They wanted to know what kind of power Han Sen had wielded.\n\nEven if that power couldn\u2019t create a deified, it seemed that he could somehow kickstart the evolution process. And any power that could aid the development of half-deifieds would be highly sought after by the races of the geno universe.\n\n\u201cBrother Dragon One, it looks like I won the bet,\u201d Klose said, looking at Dragon One.\n\n\u201cWe Dragons stay true to our word. Every Dragon will now depart the Tianxia System.\u201d Dragon One grunted. He commanded the big turtle to depart.\n\nKlose wasn\u2019t interested in watching Dragon One and the rest leave. He flew away to chase after Lando and Han Sen.\n\nBut now, Han Sen was worth far more than the bounty offered by the Extreme King. Although it didn\u2019t seem possible, if Han Sen truly could make deified elites, then he had just become priceless.\n\nHan Sen and Lando rode the Tianxia Unicorn through the blue clouds. The wounds on the Tianxia Unicorn were almost healed, but the broken horn wouldn\u2019t grow back for some time.\n\nThe Tianxia Unicorn was very sad, and he wasn\u2019t happy to have Han Sen sitting on him. But he didn\u2019t want to disobey Lando\u2019s commands, either. So, he was a very grumpy animal at that moment.\n\nHan Sen jumped off of the unicorn\u2019s back and looked up at Lando. \u201cPer the terms of our agreement, can I go now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d Lando said while looking calm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to break your promise?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He had suspected that this might happen, though, so he wasn\u2019t terribly surprised.\n\nBut if Lando really had decided to hold him against his will, it would make Han Sen\u2019s life very difficult.\n\nKlose chuckled darkly and flew over to them. He came before Han Sen and said, \u201cA promise is nothing to him. Don\u2019t you know he killed his own teacher?\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s three heads marked him as one of the Destroyed. Han Sen could immediately tell that Klose was a deified elite, but he ignored him. He continued looking at Lando, waiting for his answer.\n\nAlthough Han Sen had prepared himself for the possibility of Lando breaking his promise, he didn\u2019t think Lando was the type of person who would do that. Their personalities might be very different, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but feel that he shared something in common with Lando.\n\n\u201cLando, good job! Not only did you catch Han Sen, but you also became deified. And you tamed the Tianxia Unicorn in the process. When we return home, I will definitely put it to good use.\u201d Klose cast a substance chain toward Han Sen to tie him up.\n\nBut the substance chain didn\u2019t land on Han Sen. A purple, dragon-like substance chain flew forward to protect Han Sen. It swallowed Klose\u2019s power.\n\nKlose\u2019s eyes widened, then suddenly narrowed. He looked at Lando and asked, \u201cLando, what are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promised him that I would let him leave this place,\u201d Lando said quietly.\n\n\u201cFine. You go on your way, and I will take him back myself,\u201d Klose said with a frown.\n\n\u201cI promised to let him leave here.\u201d Lando\u2019s face remained unmoved. His expression was as emotionless as a block of stone.\n\n\u201cNot bad. Not bad. Our promise was for me to leave here. Not die here or be taken by someone else.\u201d Han Sen laughed and clapped his hands.\n\n\u201cLando, are you going to betray our ruler?\u201d Black and white substance chains had begun to rise around Klose\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just keeping a promise I made,\u201d Lando said.\n\n\u201cYou must think this through clearly. If you let Han Sen leave this place, then you are a traitor to the Destroyed. You know how we deal with traitors.\u201d Klose smiled threateningly. He went on to say, \u201cPlus, the Dragon hate your guts now. And if you betray us, the Destroyed, do you think any other race in this universe will accept you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMen that go with the flow are smart. You aren\u2019t a naive teenager. Destroying your future for the sake of a single promise isn\u2019t a good idea. I\u2019m not going to stop you, though. If you want to leave, you may. And you can take what you\u2019ve earned with you. But the prisoner is mine. I will take him back. It\u2019s none of your business, and you will have kept your promise.\u201d Klose reached out his hand to grab Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI told you that he is leaving here. Whoever tries to stop him will be trying to stop me,\u201d Lando said, his eyes locked on Klose.\n\nKlose\u2019s expression turned grim as he stared back at Lando. He coldly said, \u201cLando, do you think that being deified will let you do whatever you want? You should know that a single deified means nothing to the Destroyed. We can still have you killed with ease.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Destroyed might be able to kill me, but you can\u2019t. You can leave now, okay?\u201d Lando said, his voice as hard as granite.\n\nKlose\u2019s face was frozen. Lando\u2019s words had made him angry. He knew that he wasn\u2019t weak, but Lando had the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo and the Tianxia Unicorn on his side. If he fought Lando now, it would be one versus three. He couldn\u2019t win against those odds.\n\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t regret this decision you have made,\u201d Klose snarled. Then he turned around and disappeared in the blink of an eye.\n\n\u201cNow that he has left, have you really become a traitor to the Destroyed?\u201d Han Sen asked with a blink.\n\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve become a traitor.\u201d Lando\u2019s face seemed to be devoid of emotion. He turned the Tianxia Unicorn to continue heading out of the system."
