There are human artifacts everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it is a human place. I wonder what My Goddess is doing there?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay something, My Goddess! What is this place you have gone to?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a fighting arena. Are humans going to fight us again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, is that Yu Tuoshan? Who is his opponent, I wonder?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Yu Tuoshan is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is stupid enough to challenge him?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! A human has gone up as his opponent. He looks a bit young, though, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they putting some kid up against Yu Tuoshan? I hope they don\u2019t get mad when this child gets beaten to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cHahaha!\u201d\n\nEveryone believed Han Sen was too young to stand a chance. After all the years spent fighting humans, they had learned a lot.\n\nDue to the advent of sanctuaries, humans became stronger the older they got. Someone who was that young was typically quite weak.\n\nLian Chan did not want the chief to find out she was streaming, so she stayed silent with the camera positioned just right.\n\nHan Sen, who was now on stage, looked at Yu Tuoshan. Just as the intel stated, he had a muscular body that was complimented by purple eyes that glared wildly.\n\nThe purple horns protruding from his forehead were another confirmation that he was royal.\n\nShura dictated royalty differently than humans did. The shura monarchy was not based on lineage, and the heirs of a king would not always ascend the throne following their passing. It was possible for any shura to become king, but they had to prove themselves as the most powerful of their kind, bar none.\n\nThe shura were so strong because of their culture, which revolved around fighting.\n\nHan Sen and Yu Tuoshan eyed each other from opposite ends of the arena.\n\nThe shura disdained humans, and it was no different for Yu Tuoshan. Unlike many of the others, however, he would not underestimate an opponent.\n\nYu Tuoshan observed Han Sen carefully, placing much faith in what his eyes and gut instincts were telling him. It was very much the same way for Han Sen.\n\nAfter giving him a good look, Yu Tuoshan could detect an aura of some power in his rival. His caution was appropriate.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes were calm and full of confidence. It was a common look for him, but the shura believed there were generally only two reasons why an opponent would appear this way.\n\nFirst, Han Sen could be a reckless character, uncaring for who he fought against.\n\nOr secondly, Han Sen was confident in his own power after a careful examination of Yu Tuoshan himself.\n\nYu Tuoshan did not think the president of the Alliance would allow his daughter to marry someone so reckless, so Han Sen had to possess some amount of power.\n\nStill, he wasn\u2019t afraid. Yu Tuoshan was firm in the belief he\u2019d win, and that hadn\u2019t changed. But his excitement had increased, learning his opponent wasn\u2019t going to be a total wimp.\n\n\u201cI am Han Sen. Please go easy on me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIf Han Sen won, they\u2019d have to go exploring the crystallizer ruins together. Having an enemy for a companion on such a venture would be pointless.\n\nThe shura were still lacking an understanding for the subtleties and undertones of human emotions, though. They simply believed Han Sen was afraid. The fact he was just being polite never crossed their minds.\n\n\u201cHumans are so lame! Is that kid scared already?\u201d\n\n\u201cHas he peed himself yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha, can you blame him? Our prince is far too powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumans can be tricksy, you know. Perhaps the boy is trying to lull the prince into a false sense of security, by presenting himself as a weak child?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhatever their opinion of Han Sen was, it was in some capacity bad.\n\n\u201cHumans have been known to fake things before,\u201d Lian Chan said.\n\nThe beliefs and traditions of the shura and humanity could not be more different, so right now, it really was difficult for the shura to believe Han Sen was just being polite.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m not going to hold back,\u201d Yu Tuoshan said, staring at Han Sen with his bloodthirsty eyes.\n\nIn response, Han Sen spread his arms and said, \u201cPlease do.\u201d\n\nYu Tuoshan\u2019s muscles were like steel pistons, immediately launching Han Sen\u2019s way.\n\nThe fist made the air ripple with shockwaves. It traveled at a blistering pace, in a bid to finish Han Sen in a single opening move.\n\n\u201cShura Punch.\u201d Many of the shura were shocked to see this skill used.\n\nIt was a punch every shura knew of, as it was a basic starter skill.\n\nThat being said, it made for a great canvas. Countless shura had modified it, using it as a template for new skills of their own.\n\nIt was nothing entirely special, but it was solid. It couldn\u2019t be knocked, really.\n\nIts simplicity was reflected in its appearance, but that\u2019s not to say it looked fragile or weak in any way.\n\nHan Sen hit back with Sonic-Thunder Punch.\n\nYu Tuoshan\u2019s flesh and bone trembled with the simmering power that carried his strike, and effortlessly, it destroyed Han Sen\u2019s attempt.\n\nBoom!\n\nWhen their fists collided, Han Sen was knocked back a few meters, with skids marks tracing his knockback.\n\n\u201cThis shura really is strong. Maybe I am a little out of my league here,\u201d Han Sen calmly thought to himself."
