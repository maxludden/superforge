    "text": "Night River King thought Han Sen wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go with the Extreme King, but when he saw the recruitment roster the next day, Han Sen\u2019s name was on it. This made him exuberantly happy.\n\nHan Sen had just been added that day. Seeing his name there made Night River King want to scream in joy.\n\n\u201cGood! This is exactly as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d Night River King had to do his best to contain his mirth.\n\nIf Han Sen was gone, then it wouldn\u2019t just be Cold Palace that Night River King could keep for himself. He could likely take over Planet Eclipse unhindered. He could erase all trace of Han Sen having ever existed in Narrow Moon.\n\nOver the next few days, Night River King was on cloud nine as he waited for Han Sen to be taken away by the Ice Blue Knights.\n\nThe recruitment process was still ongoing, and the elites on Planet Eclipse soon started packing their things. It seemed as if Han Sen really was on his way out. Night River King couldn\u2019t wait for the fifteenth of the month to come, so he could bask in and absorb all the moonlight he wanted.\n\nThe Ice Blue Knights would leave on the fourteenth. He could go and absorb moonlight the day after that. He was so happy.\n\nAs Han Sen packed his things, he began making plans.\n\nBao\u2019er, Little Angel, Zero, Han Meng\u2019er, Huangfu Jing, Han Yan, Ji Qing, Little Silver, Little Invisible, and Little Star were going with the group of knights as well. But they wouldn\u2019t actually be Ice Blue Knights themselves. Instead, they would act as guards tasked with protecting Mister White.\n\nMister White was obviously important, but other than that, Han Sen didn\u2019t know exactly what position the man held within Extreme King society. He only knew that the Ice Blue Knights referred to the man as an \u201cadvisor.\u201d But even the half-deified Ice Blue Knight King greatly admired him.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t agreed to be Mister White\u2019s guard, then Han Sen would never have been allowed to bring so many people with him.\n\nThe only people they left behind on Planet Eclipse were those that wouldn\u2019t be able to grow in the chaos systems. Little Angel and the others had developed as far as they could on Planet Eclipse, so going to the systems of chaos would allow them to continue gaining strength.\n\nHe had wanted to tame the Shadow Queen Bee, but he had no more time. He eventually had no choice but to kill it inside its hive.\n\nOtherwise, after he and his strongest people left, there\u2019d be no one left to control the Queen Bee. The base would be in trouble once the Queen Bee started breeding again.\n\n\u201cMutant Xenogeneic Duke Shadow Queen Bee killed. Mutant xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Shadow Queen Bee beast soul.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was happy. He hadn\u2019t expected to earn the Shadow Queen Bee\u2019s beast soul. He looked into his Sea of Soul to examine what sort of beast soul it was.\n\nOrdinary Shadow Bees were toxic arrow beast souls, so gaining a Duke toxic arrow beast soul wouldn\u2019t be bad.\n\nMutant Shadow Queen Bee: pet beast soul (evolvable)\n\nHan Sen was shocked to see the description, but disappointed, as well. Pet beast souls needed to reach combat mode if they were ever expected to fight. He didn\u2019t have the time to grow a pet right now.\n\nBut after he thought about it, Han Sen\u2019s eyes lit up. He realized that the Shadow Queen Bee pet beast soul was different.\n\nIt could reproduce endlessly. If Han Sen could keep cultivating it, the pet could spawn additional bees out of flesh on the battlefield. It could be used to spawn an infinite number of bees.\n\nThe most important thing, though, was the fact that it was evolvable. If the Shadow Queen Bee could reach King class, then it should be able to spawn King class Shadow Bees.\n\nWhen Han Sen thought about King Shadow Bees flying everywhere, he felt incredibly happy.\n\n\u201cI have to grow this pet.\u201d Han Sen merrily summoned the Shadow Queen Bee.\n\nA red crystal Shadow Queen Bee began to fly all around Han Sen. It looked like a very calm being, but it was small too. It was far smaller than the original Shadow Queen Bee. It was only around the size of a man\u2019s fist. It looked as if it needed to reach battle mode before it would become a proper queen bee.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t a Duke yet, so he couldn\u2019t consume the queen bee\u2019s mutant xenogeneic gene. He would need to hold onto it for a while.\n\nHan Sen gave Xie Qing King a ring, and he told his old friend that he was joining the Extreme King. Han Sen also told him that he shouldn\u2019t ever go back to Planet Eclipse.\n\nAfter everything was established, the recruitment drive for the Ice Blue Knights was over. Out of the whole of Narrow Moon, only a dozen elites had been selected. They were mostly Rebate Earls and Marquises, with a single Duke joining as well.\n\nThe day that the Ice Blue Knights would be leaving, Han Sen brought his companions to them to enroll.\n\nNight River King was grinning like a lunatic, and when he saw Han Sen taking his whole family with him, he laughed and said, \u201cHan Sen, you can leave them here! I will be delighted to look after your friends and family.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Night River King and smiled. \u201cThanks, but no thanks. They are coming with me to join the Ice Blue Knights.\u201d\n\nNight River King looked at him with disdain. \u201cWhat do you think the Ice Blue Knights are? Do you think you can take along anyone you want to?\u201d\n\nBlack-Moon King and Moon Wheel King didn\u2019t know what Han Sen was doing either. It was hard enough for someone to join the Ice Blue Knights, but bringing family and friends along was simply out of the question.\n\nBut Han Sen wasn\u2019t someone who would make random, unfounded claims. He must have had a sound reason for saying what he just did.\n\n\u201cYou are right. I can bring anyone I want, and not only them. I can take you, if you want to go.\u201d Han Sen smiled at Night River King.\n\n\u201cA lame joke,\u201d Night River King grunted, but he suddenly felt a little nervous.\n\nHan Sen turned his back on Night River King and moved to join the Ice Blue Knights with his companions.\n\nMoon Wheel King and Night River King watched Han Sen take his entire family into the knights\u2019 camp. He even brought a child. And on top of that, it seemed as if Ice Blue Knight King was okay with it. The Rebate lined up, their eyes wide. They couldn\u2019t believe that this was happening.\n\nThis was one of Extreme King\u2019s top ten knight groups. Everyone knew how hard it was to enlist with any of them. Many of the Rebate Nobles had wished to send their kids to join them, but only the people that passed the tests were allowed in.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s people hadn\u2019t even undergone the tests, and what\u2019s more, there was a child amongst them. But they joined the Ice Blue Knights without hindrance. This greatly surprised the onlookers.\n\nNight River King looked aghast. Han Sen had taken his whole family. He wouldn\u2019t be able to beat Han Sen even if he claimed Planet Eclipse.\n\nNight River King gritted his teeth. Ice Blue Knight King then suddenly said, \u201cNight River King, I need people right now. I will have you join the Ice Blue Knights and work for Extreme King. Come now!\u201d\n\nEveryone in Narrow Moon was shocked. Night River King looked shell-shocked. He forced a smile. \u201cThank you, but\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Night River King could finish his sentence, Ice Blue Knight King revealed a conscription paper. He said, \u201cThis is a recruitment order that comes straight from the Extreme King\u2019s ruler. Are you going to go against this decree?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Night River King looked ill. He was as stunned as he was angry. He thought about what Han Sen had said, then turned to look at him. Han Sen was smiling his way."
