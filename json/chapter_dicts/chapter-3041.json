    "text": "Han Sen went before the slope of the mountain. He lifted his fist and prepared to punch the slope. Mister Yang quickly ran ahead to stop him. \u201cMister! Don\u2019t do that. Before the gene egg hatches, it is very weak. You cannot apply much force to it. If it is broken, the gene inside will be useless.\u201d\n\nHan Sen pulled his fist back. He looked at Mister Yang and asked, \u201cHow do I dig up the gene egg?\u201d\n\nMister Yang felt bad and said, \u201cPlease wait here for a moment. I am going to dig up the gene egg now.\u201d\n\nMister Yang really felt terrible. He was just a Mister and had no gene race of his own to use. Even if people hired him to go and find land pulses, they would not make him do such hard work.\n\nNow, Mister Yang had no choice. He had Han Sen as his master. He could not allow Han Sen to do the hard work, so he had to do it himself.\n\nMister Yang still felt rather glad. He was glad he did not take Han Sen to Ancient Big God Mountain. That place had rocks all over. He would have tired himself to death before he made any progress there.\n\nThis place was only soil and grass. Digging there would be far easier for him.\n\nMister Yang circled the slope a few times. He took out a small shovel and dug up some soil to check it. He used his nose to sniff and tongue to lick. It made Han Sen freeze.\n\nIn the end, Mister Yang settled on an appropriate location. He used his small shovel to continuously dig. He went down slowly. Mister Yang was not very strong, and his shovel was small. After digging for a while, he only managed to dig two feet down. His face was pale, and he kept gasping. Han Sen was laughing as he asked, \u201cOld Yang, are all the Misters this fancy like you?\u201d\n\nMister Yang heard what Han Sen said. He gasped before replying, \u201cAnyone can learn how to look for land pulses. The nobles that can use gene races would have an easier time. Misters like me, who do not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse must learn this just so we can survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I just dig it up myself?\u201d Han Sen could see how tired Mister Yang was. He could barely get back up. The man\u2019s forehead was sweating, so he could not help but make the offer.\n\n\u201cJust sit tight, Mister,\u201d Mister Yang said with a shake of his head. \u201cThe land pulse here is very weak. It is not buried deep. It should be out very soon. Please, just wait for a second.\u201d\n\nHan Sen sensed that Mister Yang insisted on this, so he said nothing more. He just watching him dig with interest.\n\nWhile he was digging, he suddenly heard a sound. It was like a \u201ckatcha\u201d that almost sounded like glass was broken. Mister Yang\u2019s face changed. \u201cIt cannot be that the gene egg broke. No way! With what I have predicted, it should have been half a foot away. I cannot have been wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile he was thinking, Mister Yang took out his shovel. The moment he pulled his shovel out of the soil, some spring water came bubbling out the crack.\n\nThe spring water was a bit weird. It was dark purple. The pillar of water ended up gushing out a few feet high. After it descended, it covered the soil Mister Yang had dug up. There was more and more purple water coming out. Mister Yang was shocked. He looked at the spring-like purple liquid. His face changed. He screamed, \u201cEvil spirit spring water! How could there be an evil spirit spring\u2026\u201d Han Sen saw that Mister Yang was frightened. The man\u2019s elderly body fell back. He almost tripped and stumbled. He threw away the shovel. Han Sen reached out his hand to hold the man\u2019s back. After he stabilized him, he asked, \u201cWhat is an evil spirit spring? Did you not say there was a gene egg there?\u201d\n\nMister Yang\u2019s face turned pale. \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here. We cannot dig here. If we keep digging, we will both end up dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me why first. It was fine earlier, so why can we not dig any further?\u201d Han Sen was not in a rush. He still spoke with a smile.\n\nMister Yang wanted to leave right then and there, but Han Sen did not want to. He could not leave without explaining, so he hastily said, \u201cI must have made a mistake. I thought this was just a small land pulse, but this place has an evil spirit spring. If we do not go, a disaster will fall upon us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with evil spirit spring?\u201d Han Sen still did not see why they had to leave. He pulled Mister Yang and peered at the purple spring water that kept spilling out.\n\nMister Yang\u2019s heart was rapidly beating. He wanted to use the shovel and knock Han Sen out to drag him away someplace safe.\n\nBut he was not powerful enough to do that. Han Sen had his hands on him, and he could not even run if he wanted to. He hurriedly replied, \u201cDid I not tell you that all creatures have a god? Gene eggs are created by the god of all things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I remember,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod.\n\n\u201cBasically, gods are spirits. Everything has a spirit. When those spirits gather together, a gene egg is formed. Everything can be good and bad, so spirits can be good and bad too. If you see some purple air rise in the land pulse, that means there are evil spirits around the land pulse. In an old battleground where many people died, there are often evil spirit pulses.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Mister Yang went on to say, \u201cI never heard about this place being the site of an old battleground before. I did not expect there to be an evil spirit air, and the evil spirit already made a spring in this land pulse. That means there is something evil beneath this land pulse. If we do not leave, we will be affected by the evil spirit spring. Something unfortunate might happen to us. We should just run now.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen heard this, he looked at him and asked, \u201cAccording to what you have told me, if there is an evil spirit spring, does that not mean the land pulse is strong? In that case, isn\u2019t there a possibility of us having a higher-level gene egg?\u201d \u201cYou are correct. But if you get the evil spirit spring on you, you will suffer disaster. The gene egg that hails from this evil land pulse will harbor something wretched. Ordinary God Spirit Blood-Pulses would not be able to suppress it. If you are forced to combine with it, it might take over the master. The stronger the gene egg is, the more harm it can do to the master. I would suggest not touching it.\u201d Mister Yang saw that the hole he had dug was full of liquid. He had a morbid expression. He now wanted to leave more than anything else.\n\n\u201cI understand. You can head on home, Old Yang.\u201d Han Sen let go of Mister Yang. He walked over to the spring by himself.\n\nly\n\nMister Yang was going to run off, but he saw Han Sen approached the evil spirit spring. He quickly shouted, \u201cMister, what do you want to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go back now. I will look for you later.\u201d After speaking, Han Sen moved to pick up the little shovel Mister Yang had thrown away. He squatted next to the hole and started digging.\n\n\u201cMister, please don\u2019t do it! From what I know, whoever encounters an evil spirit spring and touches but a mere drop, let alone digging, very bad things happen to them. The last leader of Ancient God City dug up an evil spirit spring and touched the evil spirit spring water. He turned into a monster with purple eyes that killed everyone. He did not even dig up the gene egg!\u201d Mister Yang tried to convince Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYou just go back. I will be careful.\u201d Han Sen did not care for Mister Yang\u2019s concerns and continued digging with the shovel.\n\nHe was not afraid of a sky full of God Spirits, so he was not going to be afraid of evil spirits."
