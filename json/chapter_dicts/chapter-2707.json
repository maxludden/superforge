    "text": "Han Sen could feel a weird sort of presence being released from Bao Lian\u2019s body. Even Han Sen had to compliment him, saying, \u201cThe Extreme King\u2019s king bodies are so scary. Just using his king body has allowed him to increase his presence by many multiples. The deifieds of an ordinary race cannot fight against the deifieds of the Extreme King.\u201d\n\nWhile Han Sen was still lost in thought, Bao Lian closed his eyes and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill you, but you seem to be seeking your death. Don\u2019t blame me for doing what you have asked me to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have power, show me what you\u2019ve got. Otherwise, stop talking crap,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBao Lian didn\u2019t speak. He opened his eyes and suddenly looked at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen felt like Bao Lian\u2019s vision was now on him. He suddenly felt a foreign energy wind around him, but what this new power was, Han Sen couldn\u2019t determine. It was like it was there, but it was not there.\n\nAfter that look, Bao Lian turned his head away and started running off.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t determined a winner yet. Where are you going?\u201d Han Sen said with a frown.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead. Go and prepare your funeral,\u201d Bao Lian said over his shoulder as he continued heading away. His sprinting form soon disappeared from sight.\n\nHan Sen wanted to go after Bao Lian, but that strange, almost undetectable power was making him feel sick.\n\nSince Exquisite and Li Keer were near, Han Sen didn\u2019t want to use his other geno arts to get rid of the effect. He looked at them and said, \u201cDid you both see what kind of power Bao Lian used on me?\u201d\n\nLi Keer shook her head. \u201cBao Lian is an heir of the former ruler King Bao. Bao Lian is one of his children. Right now, King Bai is in charge. King Bao wasn\u2019t very powerful, therefore he isn\u2019t that famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you tell what element was used against me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nExquisite examined Han Sen\u2019s body. After a while, she said, \u201cThe Very High are very skilled when it comes to sensing types of energy. But Bao Lian\u2019s power is very strange. Not even I can tell what element he used. It felt like causal power, but that isn\u2019t exactly right.\u201d\n\nWith Exquisite and Li Keer both being unable to determine what they had just witnessed, Han Sen frowned. He used The Story of Genes to examine his body, but he didn\u2019t find anything weird within him.\n\nHis power seemed to be unaffected. There were no hidden wounds or anything. He had no clue what Bao Lian\u2019s power had done to him.\n\n\u201cIs Bao Lian playing a prank on me?\u201d Han Sen double-checked his body to ensure things were all right.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer examined Han Sen using many different methods, but they failed to learn anything.\n\nHan Sen could detect some sort of power surrounding him, but it couldn\u2019t be removed. In his heart, though, he felt as if something was deeply wrong.\n\nWhile Han Sen was trying his best to avoid using his Dongxuan Area, he suddenly heard a scary sound coming from the sky.\n\nThe three of them immediately raised their heads to see what was coming. The sunny skies were becoming cloudy and overcast. All of a sudden, everything around them became pitch-black. Within the blink of an eye, the sky looked dark.\n\n\u201cA God Spirit Storm is here. We have to go.\u201d Exquisite and Li Keer looked to be in shock. They pulled Han Sen away with them by making use of Galaxy Teleport. They wanted to stay as far away from the God Spirit Storm as they possibly could.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer were already half-deified. They only dared to venture across these lands due to the fact that they had the power of God\u2019s Wander. They could use it to avoid the areas that were claimed by God Spirit Storms.\n\nOtherwise, with their current power, it would only take a couple of deified xenogeneics to bury them.\n\nAfter using Galaxy Teleport, Han Sen found himself in a desert. There was no way to tell how far he might have teleported away, but the sky no longer had a God Spirit Storm brewing in it.\n\nBefore the three of them had enough time to come to their senses, they heard the sky growl with a scary peal of thunder again. The ominous cloud covered the sky again.\n\n\u201cWhy are we so unlucky? We\u2019ve run into a God Spirit Storm again,\u201d Exquisite said with a frown.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to worry about that right now. Let\u2019s just run,\u201d Li Keer said quickly. If they ended up getting dragged into a God Spirit Storm, there was an 80% to 90% chance they would end up slaughtered.\n\nThe three of them used Galaxy Teleport again. They went to someplace else. But as soon as they appeared in their new location, the sky showed signs of a brewing God Spirit Storm once more.\n\nThis time, even Han Sen could feel that something was wrong. His eyes narrowed and he said, \u201cIt cannot be Bao Lian\u2019s power doing this to me, can it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is impossible. Bao Lian is just a primitive deified. His power is far too weak for him to affect\u2014much less control\u2014a God Spirit Storm. He\u2019s the lowest rank of deified, and even a true god couldn\u2019t summon a God Spirit Storm,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\nThe three of them used Galaxy Teleport again, but after a few more jumps, they realized that a God Spirit Storm would begin to brew wherever they went.\n\n\u201cI must be right. It must be Bao Lian\u2019s power affecting the God Spirit Storm and causing it to spawn around us.\u201d Although this possibility was hard to put stock in, there didn\u2019t seem to be any other explanation.\n\nBefore they met Bao Lian, no God Spirit Storms had plagued them. But now, God Spirit Storms were appearing wherever they went. It was obviously connected with Bao Lian\u2019s power.\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite found this to be incredibly difficult to believe. After all, Bao Lian was just a primitive deified; the notion that he could control a God Spirit Storm was outlandish. But then again, this was the fact that was staring them in the face. They had no choice but to accept the reality in front of them.\n\n\u201cThe God Spirit Storm comes too quickly. We don\u2019t have enough time to open the door to leave the god area. And if we keep using Galaxy Teleport, we won\u2019t last long that way, either,\u201d Li Keer said. Her face was rapidly losing its color.\n\nGalaxy Teleport was a bit of an energy hog. The further they teleported, the more energy it cost them. But teleporting only a short distance wouldn\u2019t take them far enough from the God Spirit Storm to keep them safe.\n\nHan Sen was studying God\u2019s Wander, but he hadn\u2019t learned Galaxy Teleport yet. He had to be carried by Exquisite or Li Keer, and that was costing them even more energy.\n\nIf they kept using Galaxy Teleport like that, the two of them would only have the energy to make another 20 to 30 jumps. With the power they were spending, the distance they could travel would continue to decrease.\n\n\u201cKeer, you teleport to another location. Exquisite will teleport somewhere else with me. Then, we\u2019ll meet up on our next jump,\u201d Han Sen said to Li Keer.\n\nThe two of them could sense what Han Sen was thinking. They didn\u2019t object, and they did as he instructed.\n\nWith this test, they were able to confirm that the problem was indeed Han Sen. After Li Keer teleported away by herself, she didn\u2019t encounter a God Spirit Storm again.\n\nAnd when Exquisite and Han Sen teleported, they were immediately hounded by the God Spirit Storm again.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I underestimated that deified elite.\u201d Han Sen had to admit his failure this time. He had lost completely. Bao Lian, who was just a primitive deified, had placed him quite firmly in a terrible situation.\n\nThis was a very dangerous situation for him to be in. Exquisite and Li Keer had followed him there, but if the two women opened their doors, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t be able to leave. He had to open the god area gate himself. However, judging by the time it took to open the door and how long it took for a God Spirit Storm to spawn, he would be sucked into the storm before he could slip out of the god area.\n\nRight now, he was at the end of the road. Unless the God Spirit Storm stopped chasing him, that was. Otherwise, he would end up in the storm. Thinking about the countless deified xenogeneics that spawned inside those storms, Han Sen\u2019s head felt itchy."
