Is it because of the mushrooms?\u201d Han Sen pointed at the plants that were on both of their heads.\n\nGu Qingcheng shook her head. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not a person of the modern age. I am a Qi Gong user of ancient times.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is this happening because of your lifespan?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. Gu Qingcheng was the same as him; both of them had entered a crystallizer control room. When Gu Qingcheng had left the control room, she had been transported tens of thousands of years beyond the period in which she had been born. She had entered a world that was completely different from the one she knew.\n\nIf they calculated the time that had passed while she was in the control room, Gu Qingcheng should have died a long time ago.\n\nGu Qingcheng nodded, then shook her head. \u201cIt is because of my lifespan, but it is not as you think. It isn\u2019t because I entered a crystallizer control room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, what is it?\u201d Han Sen asked in concern.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked at each other. Then, Elysian Moon said, \u201cIt is because of me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen turned his gaze to Elysian Moon and said nothing. He waited for her to proceed. He still had no idea what was going on.\n\nElysian Moon was confused and unsure of what to say. She moved her lips but no words came. Gu Qingcheng said, \u201cLet me explain it, then.\u201d\n\nHan Sen turned back to Gu Qingcheng. He was growing more concerned by the minute.\n\nA long time ago, he had been interested in the relationship between Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. Gu Qingcheng was an ancient human Qi Gong master. Elysian Moon had been a spirit inside the sanctuaries. Their races were different, but they looked exactly the same. So, Han Sen was curious about the relationship they shared.\n\n\u201cI practiced a Qi Gong called Sword Fairy Picture,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said. \u201cAccording to the ancient theories of Qi Gong, you could watch yourself generate a god and become the Sword Fairy Picture. Through this, you could unlock the Sword Fairy Path.\u201d\n\n\u201cElysian Moon is your Sword Fairy Picture? You created her?\u201d Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng with shock.\n\nGu Qingcheng shook her head. \u201cElysian Moon is the Elysian Spirit, and she is very special. Due to an accident, the two of us combined with my Sword Fairy Picture. That was how our fates became intertwined.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. He wasn\u2019t sure what sort of \u201caccident\u201d she was referring to. It would have taken quite an accident to make a Qi Gong master connect with a spirit, after all.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that I was different from ordinary spirits? I told you that my spirit stone wasn\u2019t in a spirit statue, and I kept it on my person instead. I was actually lying to you, though. My spirit stone had already combined with her.\u201d Elysian Moon pointed at Gu Qingcheng.\n\n\u201cIs that related to your lifespan?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nGu Qingcheng nodded. \u201cOur situation is very complicated. I am a human combined with a spirit\u2019s spirit stone. It made my spirit very strong, and I also earned the body type of a spirit. I took Elysian Moon\u2019s spirit stone, while she drew power from my Sword Fairy Picture. Over time, her body changed. We are a part of each other, but not exactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we entered the Alliance, we were reconstructed. At that time, our connection was pretty much severed. We thought the effect we had on each other would be over and we would live apart from each other, but after contacting each other, we swiftly found out that the connection was becoming stronger and stronger. Stronger than it had been before.\u201d\n\nElysian Moon looked gloomy. She said, \u201cIn the geno universe, this power resulted in big changes happening to our bodies. We have begun to level up very quickly, and as long as there is energy available, our level can continue to increase at this rate. We were happy about this, but then we discovered that these changes make us age faster, as well.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed. \u201cYou guys are saying you are getting old very fast?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that. I\u2019m not sure exactly how it works. Based on the speed we\u2019ve been progressing, though, we only have a year at best. A few months, in the worst-case scenario. We will grow old, and we will die.\u201d Gu Qingcheng nodded.\n\n\u201cHave you found a way to stop this?\u201d Thinking about what Bao\u2019er said, Han Sen had a few guesses.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. Elysian Moon said, \u201cWe have been investigating this issue for quite some time, and we have conducted many tests. We have come to realize that we are supposed to be together. As long as we remain separate, we will never be whole. So, there are flaws in our genes. These flaws are what is making us grow so old so fast. They\u2019re pushing us to develop far too quickly.\u201d\n\nGu Qingcheng leaned forward and said, \u201cIt is like this: if we were ordinary humans, our lives would have a lifespan of one hundred years. Our current aging process is like that of a mosquito. From birth to death, our whole lives could now pass us by in a fortnight. The only way to get rid of this flaw is for me and Elysian Moon to become one. In that way, we can repair the flaws of our genes. When we are perfect, we will have a lifespan like an ordinary human.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you guys combine and become one person?\u201d Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon with confusion.\n\nWhile Elysian Moon was still a spirit, Han Sen could picture her possessing Gu Qingcheng.\n\nNow that they both had physical bodies in the geno universe, Han Sen couldn\u2019t believe that they could still combine.\n\n\u201cI wish we couldn\u2019t, but we did find out it was possible. But that means we will become one person, and even our personalities will be merged.\u201d Elysian Moon looked dire.\n\nHan Sen understood the crux of their conflict now. As a creature with emotions, no one would want to be a part of another. They wanted to be individuals.\n\nBut now they must become a part of each other. Otherwise, they\u2019d die. It was a very painful dilemma.\n\nAs Han Sen thought about their conflict, he realized that they were fighting over which of the two would control the body.\n\nBut the reality was crueler than Han Sen thought. Gu Qingcheng coldly said, \u201cAnd we found another way. We don\u2019t need to combine our personalities; the other option is for one person to die. That way, the body of the deceased can be combined with the body of the living one. If we do that, there will only be one personality. There would be no need for a merging.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He just stared at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon with bewilderment. He hadn\u2019t expected that to be a potential solution.\n\n\u201cAre you guys going to go through with this?\u201d Han Sen sighed. In a situation like this, Han Sen didn\u2019t know how he should advise Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there is a fairer alternative. If the two of us are going to die, then I would rather the other be alive,\u201d Elysian Moon coldly said.\n\n\u201cEven when you combine and become one, your personalities may not match,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cNo, they do. We have tried it before.\u201d Elysian Moon shook her head with certainty.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Han Sen asked the two with curiosity.\n\nElysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng didn\u2019t say anything. They looked at each other, and then Han Sen\u2019s mouth opened wide. Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng walked nearer each other. Then, when their two pretty faces drew closer, they locked lips in a kiss."
