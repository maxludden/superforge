    "text": "The white-haired man looked at the little red bird in his hand. It kept squirming, thrashing its wings as it tried to escape the grasp. He spoke to himself, saying, \u201cYou really have phoenix and fish bird genes? And it is still so young? Who could do something like this?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er looked at the white-haired man. She blinked and said, \u201cAre you going to bully a kid and her pet?\u201d\n\nWhen the white-haired man heard Bao\u2019er, he turned to her and smiled. Raising his hand, he freed the little red bird. It flapped its wings and quickly hid behind Bao\u2019er, too afraid to reveal itself.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the white-haired man asked Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, Han Bao\u2019er,\u201d Bao\u2019er answered seriously. Aside from the times when she was with Han Sen and Ji Yanran, she was rarely so honest.\n\n\u201cNot bad. Say hi to your father for me.\u201d The white-haired man nodded to Bao\u2019er, then turned to leave.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, looking at the white-haired man\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cTai Yi.\u201d The white-haired man didn\u2019t look back. He kept on walking. After a few steps, though, his body began to disappear into a ripple in space.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked.\n\n\u201cCalling in a debt. It\u2019s time that I get back something that doesn\u2019t belong to them.\u201d The white-haired man\u2019s voice echoed through the cosmos, drifting from an increasing distance until it vanished entirely.\n\nFalling Leaf was left trembling. She had never seen someone use a teleportation skill while still sending back their voice. Even King Bai couldn\u2019t do something like that.\n\nAs Falling Leaf recovered from her shock, someone cried out, calling for aid.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d\n\nThey turned around, and a girl wearing pink clothing was running through in the middle of the fight. She sprinted toward them, screaming and sobbing.\n\nA Duke xenogeneic worker was chasing after her. It had no weapon, and it was reaching for the woman with its bare hands.\n\nBased on how she was moving, the woman seemed stronger than the Duke worker. But she also looked terrified, and she ran recklessly without the will or courage to look back.\n\nBao\u2019er cocked her head curiously as Ning Yue approached. She remembered Ning Yue, and no matter how much she tried, she couldn\u2019t connect this Ning Yue with the powerful person she used to know.\n\n\u201cHelp me! Bao\u2019er, help me!\u201d Ning Yue pleaded, running forward like a dog with its tail between its legs.\n\nFalling Leaf was about to stop Ning Yue, but Bao\u2019er hastily told her. \u201cLet him come.\u201d\n\nNing Yue stumbled clumsily into the ruins of the room, and when she got there, she hid behind Bao\u2019er, still shaking. \u201cToo\u2026 Too scary! Save me, Bao\u2019er!\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! Little Miss Ning Yue, you should be much stronger than that lame Duke. What are you afraid of?\u201d Bao\u2019er laughed, looking at Ning Yue as if she was eyeing a fun new toy.\n\nTremors still ran through Ning Yue\u2019s body. Her face looked pale. She really seemed to be rattled.\n\n\u201cFighting\u2014fighting is wrong! Murder is even more wrong\u2026 Plus, I am such a beautiful girl\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Bao\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Her eyes smiled like a crescent moon, and she stroked Ning Yue\u2019s hair. \u201cRight, right. You are so right. Pretty and cute girls like us shouldn\u2019t be fighting and killing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d Ning Yue frantically nodded her agreement. She still looked to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\n\nFalling Leaf didn\u2019t agree at all. She swiftly used her dagger to cut the Duke\u2019s head off.\n\n\u201cWhat happened? Why is this happening? Does this have something to do with that man?\u201d Falling Leaf looked around. The killing was taking place everywhere, and she didn\u2019t seem to know where to look.\u201d\n\nMore creatures were toward them. Falling Leaf warned them loudly to stay back, but they didn\u2019t listen to her words, and so she had to fight and cut them down.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen and Miss Mirror were still having a stand-off. Neither of them had yet made the first move.\n\n\u201cMe or her. You can only pick one.\u201d Miss Mirror eyed Han Sen, her grip on the broken sword still tight.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave here together. This place is so scary; it will be safer if we go someplace with more people.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cSafety depends on what kind of partner you have. I don\u2019t want to haul a ticking time bomb around with me, not knowing if it will explode at any moment,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cThen how about you keep going on ahead by yourself, and I will turn back with the girl. Is that okay?\u201d Han Sen said after a moment of thought.\n\n\u201cNo. Do you want her to bring harm to my Spring Rain?\u201d Miss Mirror frowned.\n\n\u201cThen I will wait here with her and not go anywhere,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cNo. If you cannot do it, then I will do it for you,\u201d Miss Mirror said. She swung her sword at the girl in Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\nMiss Mirror had become King class, but her will and intelligence were still deified. Her slash appeared like a rainbow, not straight, but mysteriously curved. It made it very difficult to tell where the sword was headed.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s movements were also difficult to predict, but after a couple of attempts to evade the attack, he was still unable to dodge Miss Mirror\u2019s sword. He threw his palm out to intercept the broken sword. He touched its hilt, but not its blade.\n\nThe broken sword could cut through a requiem tree, so it was far too sharp to counter directly. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t use his own weapon to block the blow. Even a deified treasure might be destroyed by the broken sword.\n\nBut when his palm struck the hilt of the broken sword, a sharp pain seared through his chest. A wave of power sent him flying and made his ribs groan under the strain. He tasted blood in the back of his mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Something injured my chest. Is this my own power?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself, but Miss Mirror\u2019s broken sword came slashing toward him again.\n\nMiss Mirror was proving why she had been such a powerful deified elite. Her sword skills far exceeded Han Sen\u2019s abilities, and she was still extremely strong.\n\nAnd her sword skills were uncanny. No matter how much Han Sen varied his movement patterns, he couldn\u2019t avoid the strike. It was kind of like a Falsified-Sky attack, but this attack lacked Causal powers.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen had to reach out his hand to counter the attack. Like last time, his hand struck the hilt of the broken sword. Another impact thudded into his chest and sent him flying.\n\nMiss Mirror followed him like his own shadow. She kept trying to strike that girl that Han Sen held in his arms.\n\n\u201cIs this your Mirror Spirit Body?\u201d Han Sen asked as he retreated.\n\n\u201cYes. Even as a King class, I can kill you easily. So don\u2019t test my patience,\u201d Miss Mirror said warningly.\n\n\u201cSo your Mirror Spirit Body can only return attacks that I deal? That\u2019s not very impressive,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not amazing, but it\u2019s enough to kill you,\u201d Miss Mirror declared.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re willing to kill me?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t fall back anymore. He wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid the next attack, and he couldn\u2019t counterattack Miss Mirror or the broken sword. He turned around and used his body to shield the girl from the blade.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that I won\u2019t kill you,\u201d Miss Mirror said with obvious annoyance, as she stopped her sword."
