That realization made him feel much safer.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, performing blessings can harm my body and reduce my lifespan. After blessing someone, it takes me half a year to recover. My lifespan is also cut down by a hundred years. If I didn\u2019t need the xenogeneic genes, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted Barr\u2019s offer. So, if you offer me two thousand, four thousand, or even five thousand now, I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry if I have to disappoint you like this,\u201d Han Sen said, feeling bad about the words even as they came out of his mouth.\n\nAlthough using the Blood-Pulse Sutra consumed a lot of energy, it wasn\u2019t half as bad as Han Sen made it sound. He only needed a day or two of rest. And in regards to shortening his lifespan, that was pure nonsense.\n\nHan Sen said this because he didn\u2019t wish to bless any old Tom, Dick, and Harry that came by. And he needed to maintain his reputation. He wouldn\u2019t be considered as prestigious and special if he went around blessing everyone.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think he was lying, though. They wouldn\u2019t believe that a deified could be produced for practically no cost at all.\n\nWhat Han Sen said seemed to make sense. Reducing a lifespan by one hundred years for a deified was still a low price to pay.\n\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t harm their lifespans. For them, it was okay.\n\nBut what made them so depressed was the fact that Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to accept King xenogeneic genes in order to bless others.\n\nNow, every race regretted it. If they had known what would happen when Han Sen first announced a blessing for the price of two thousand xenogeneic genes, they\u2019d have bought it without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nThe situation now sucked. Even if they paid him triple the original price, he wouldn\u2019t bless them.\n\n\u201cWe allowed the Destroyed to snap up a bargain.\u201d Many of the higher races felt incredibly sad. They were very jealous of the Destroyed\u2019s Barr.\n\n\u201cMr. Godfather, I\u2019m willing to use my body. I will be a maid or a slave or anything you wish of me to become. I\u2019m begging you to be nice enough to bless me just once.\u201d A Fox woman winked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTeacher Han, this is the Sky Treasure Lotus, known as the Five Treasure. Eating one lotus seed can increase your lifespan by ten years. There are twenty-three here. I\u2019m hoping you will be willing to bless our master just once.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeacher Han\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen had said he was no longer accepting xenogeneic genes, so the smarter people started to offer all sorts of different benefits and gifts in the hope it would convince Han Sen to bless them.\n\n\u201cMy body hasn\u2019t yet healed. I cannot bless you. It is useless, even if I make promises. You must wait until my body is healed first.\u201d Continuing to talk to them was pointless. No matter how many times Han Sen tried to explain things, he couldn\u2019t get rid of them, so he decided to exit the core area.\n\nBack in the white whale, Han Sen became Dollar again. Then he returned to the core area.\n\nWith Barr\u2019s two thousand core xenogeneic genes, he was very close to getting his four areas to the ninth tier. Han Sen planned to kill a few xenogeneics by himself, and while doing so, he might as well practice his teleportation abilities and Big Destroyed.\n\nSince he used Dollar\u2019s identity to enter the core area, not many people cared to bother him. That didn\u2019t mean that no one came after him, however.\n\nHan Sen found the bronze furnace, and after they flew for only a few minutes, two women of the Sky came racing toward him. One of them was Li Keer. He already knew her. The other woman had a white veil obscuring her face. Han Sen couldn\u2019t determine what she looked like, but he knew she was one of the Sky.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, long time no see,\u201d Li Keer said calmly, forcing her demeanor to be casual.\n\nShe and the other woman had been waiting there all that time for Han Sen to show up again in his Dollar persona. But it had been a long time since Han Sen used that persona, and so they had been waiting for a very long time.\n\nFortunately, they were not impatient people. They had remained by Dollar\u2019s exit point until he reappeared.\n\n\u201cLady Keer, who is this?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Third Sister. He thought that the woman was quite strange. She didn\u2019t seem to be looking at a person; it was more like she was examining a product, and it made Han Sen feel rather uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThis is Third Sister. Her name is Exquisite.\u201d After Li Keer introduced the other woman, she said, \u201cBrother Dollar, if you don\u2019t have anything else to do, how about we hunt xenogeneics together?\u201d\n\nHan Sen hesitated. He didn\u2019t want to travel with others. He really just wanted to quietly hunt xenogeneics and practice his geno arts for a while.\n\nBut he did have a history with Li Keer, and so he would have felt bad if he turned down her request.\n\n\u201cLi Keer taught me how to teleport, and she knows I have Big Destroyed. I suppose I can practice in front of her,\u201d Han Sen thought. He nodded to the women. \u201cSure. I\u2019m not familiar with this area. Do you know where I can find King class xenogeneics?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know of a place with many King class xenogeneics. Allow me to take you there,\u201d Li Keer said with a laugh.\n\nHan Sen went silent for a moment, then said, \u201cIf we cooperate, there is something we should discuss first. We should talk about how we will separate the loot.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about an even split?\u201d Li Keer suggested.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think that is great. I will take fifty percent, and you two split the other fifty. Are you guys okay with that?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nLi Keer was surprised. When she suggested an even split, she meant that they should divide the loot three ways, with everyone getting an equal share. Her even split was different from his even split.\n\nExquisite said coldly, \u201cThat division of shares is unfair. Whoever works the most should earn the most. We are cooperating, but we don\u2019t need to divide up the prizes. There are many xenogeneics. Whoever kills a beast can loot it. Sharing doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the way you think.\u201d Han Sen nodded. Splitting things up that way would be best.\n\nWith Li Keer leading the way, the three of them flew into space.\n\nHan Sen was able to talk easily to Li Keer, but Exquisite had a very loner-type personality. She wasn\u2019t very fond of talking, and she didn\u2019t say a word to Han Sen.\n\nThe way she looked at Han Sen made him uncomfortable, too. She was like a robot without any emotions.\n\nExquisite was going to use this xenogeneic-hunting opportunity to get a first-hand look at the power Han Sen wielded. She wanted to see more of his personality, too.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t expected that Han Sen would suggest dividing up the loot in such a way. Rather than saying anything, Exquisite planned to teach Han Sen a lesson.\n\nShe was going to test Han Sen\u2019s mettle and steal all of his kills.\n\n\u201cI want to see who you really are.\u201d Exquisite touched her eyes. They had healed now, but she was still scared after what happened.\n\nThe bronze furnace was flying next to Han Sen. When they reached a certain area, it stopped in its tracks and started to cry to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen asked, frowning and looking at the bronze furnace.\n\n\u201cDanger,\u201d the bronze furnace said by writing words in fire and smoke."
