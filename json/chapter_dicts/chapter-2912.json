    "text": "The big barren systems. That place was like a heaven for those in search of high-level xenogeneics. There were all kinds of deified xenogeneics, but all of them seemed to be in a perpetual rage. Therefore, it was a dangerous place to venture.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s current power, there was no need to worry too much about it.\n\n\u201cLittleflower should be in the big barren systems. With my current power, if I can find Littleflower, I will be able to save him from Old Cat.\u201d Han Sen made up his mind to go to the big barren systems.\n\nPreviously, the reason he had not gone was not that he did not want to save or care about Littleflower. It was because he lacked the necessary power. If he died in the big barren system, his family would die.\n\nHe knew Littleflower was not in any danger. So, Han Sen kept a low profile while trying to slowly level up.\n\n\u201cNow should be the time.\u201d Han Sen set up things in Space Garden. He readied himself to go to the big barren system.\n\nThere was nothing much to prepare. Ever since Qin Xuan came to the geno universe, she had been in charge of many things. She managed Space Garden very well. It made the Han Sen, who was a bad leader, a bit embarrassed.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame Ning Yue has already become primitive. He still cannot get rid of the little green sword affecting him. The little green sword is stronger than I thought it would be.\u201d Han Sen was hoping for Ning Yue to get well soon so he could be useful again.\n\nLing\u2019er was sent back to the Alliance by Han Sen. Kindergarten was going to start again, so she had to return there to study. She could not stay in the universe.\n\nAlthough Ling\u2019er\u2019s body could survive in the big universe, and she was able to adjust to the environment of the big universe and was better than most creatures in it, Han Sen wanted her childhood to be one of peace in the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen packed some necessities. He was preparing to use Space Teleportation to reach the big barren systems. He suddenly felt something heavy on his back. Bao\u2019er landed on his back. She grabbed his neck and was being cute. \u201cDad, Space Garden is boring! Bao\u2019er wants to follow you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is too dangerous this time. You should just stay home. I will take you out of here next time.\u201d Although Bao\u2019er was special, the big barren system was too dangerous. Han Sen was not planning on taking her.\n\n\u201cNo! Bao\u2019er wants to go now.\u201d Bao\u2019er used her hands to grip Han Sen\u2019s neck. She refused to let go. No matter what Han Sen said, she could not be convinced. She really wanted to go with him.\n\nHan Sen felt guilty, so he agreed to take Bao\u2019er with him. \u201cFine, but you must be good. You cannot just runoff.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er, on her own, was not weak. Han Sen was also quite confident in his own abilities. Even if he was unable to fight, he could escape with Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cLong live my Daddy.\u201d Bao\u2019er happily jumped into Han Sen\u2019s chest and kissed him on the cheek.\n\nHan Sen felt bad. He rubbed Bao\u2019er on the head. He could not resist her.\n\nThere were many ways into the big barren systems. The most direct way was to make use of the Four Sheep Cube. With it, he could enter the big barren system right away. He could even open the gate in the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen thought about it for some time. He decided to head there via the universe, searching from the outside to the inside.\n\nHan Sen read a lot of information about the big barren system. He did not see anything genuinely useful. Most of what he saw were just guesses driven by old myths and legends.\n\nThat was expected. Ordinary deifieds who entered the big barren systems rarely came back alive. Those that dared to go were either butterfly elites or higher. They would not casually post about their experiences in the big barren systems on the internet. It was expensive, classified information.\n\nThe space was all greyed out. He could see giant machines everywhere. There were planets with lots of holes. It was like most of the planets were snowing.\n\nIn space, it was impossible for it to snow. These things, floating in space with the shape of a snowflake, were things Han Sen had no idea about. They were like ash from a volcano.\n\nThis was the edge of the big barren system. Although he had just entered the big barren systems, it felt lonely there. It made people feel rather bad.\n\nA broken battleship floated through space like an asteroid. It kept hitting other asteroids to make a deep sound. The pieces of the battleship and asteroids were covered in the grey dust. After the hit, some parts were showing.\n\n\u201cI wonder how far away from East Holy Kirin Garden we are.\u201d Han Sen went to East Holy Kirin Garden once before. This time, his way was different. He hadn\u2019t been here before.\n\n\u201cDad, what is this?\u201d Bao\u2019er sat on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, pointing at the broken ships.\n\nHan Sen looked to where Bao\u2019er was pointing. He saw the broken ships had been hit by meteors. The grey dust was like an avalanche that started to break.\n\nIt was a battleship that was partially ball-shaped. Many of its parts were broken. It was like an apple that had been bitten in half.\n\nBecause dust had fallen, one was able to see a broken spot. Some orange light seeped out. The orange light was fluctuating between bright and dark, which was why Bao\u2019er noticed it.\n\nHan Sen carefully flew to the ship. He used the Dongxuan Aura to keep scanning the battleship. He did not want to discover a xenogeneic inside.\n\nFortunately, what worried Han Sen did not come to pass. He entered the battleship from the broken portions. He did not feel the presence of xenogeneics.\n\nInside the battleship, however, was chaos. The tools and wires were all broken. Most of the stuff was covered in white dust.\n\nThe flickering, orange light came from a corner. Han Sen waved his hand to brush all the pieces around that corner away. The glowing thing underneath was a very cute doll.\n\nThat doll had the face of a little girl. She had black hair and big eyes. She was wearing a beautiful dress, but it was covered in dust. Thus, it looked very vintage.\n\nThe place that released orange light was atop the doll\u2019s chest. The doll\u2019s neck had a pendant necklace. The pendant was an orange gem. It had been the gem flickering like a lamp the whole time.\n\nHan Sen used his hand and sucked. He pulled the girl doll and necklace over. The white dust fell off. The dust was everywhere."
