    "text": "\u201cI am giving you one last chance,\u201d Miss Mirror said, her voice as harsh as a winter wind.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to kill Han Sen. After all, he was the master of the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring. Killing him would deal a lot of damage to the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring, which would affect Miss Mirror herself very severely.\n\nBut although she really didn\u2019t want to risk damaging the ring, she wanted to kill Lady Wan\u2019er even more. If Han Sen refused to walk away, then she needed to beat Han Sen badly enough that he was no longer in any condition to protect the girl.\n\n\u201cIf the last picture is true, will it be me and Han Sen in front of that statue with a thousand hands and a thousand eyes?\u201d Miss Mirror wondered.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, you overestimate your Mirror Area\u2019s power.\u201d Twin trails of blood streaked over Han Sen\u2019s cheeks as he held Lady Wan\u2019er. He looked very calm.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Miss Mirror snapped, looking a bit angry. She had never been this patient with anyone before. If another person had tested her temper like this, even if they were deified, she would have struck them down.\n\nShe kept enduring Han Sen\u2019s stubbornness and rudeness, but he obviously didn\u2019t appreciate that she was going easy on him. It was very frustrating for Miss Mirror. She used her sword to slash at the mirror.\n\nHan Sen moved the moment Miss Mirror swung the broken sword. Her broken sword entered the mirror, but it couldn\u2019t hurt Han Sen this time.\n\n\u201cYour Mirror Area can assault my shadow within the mirror you create. Since that shadow is linked to my real body, you can hurt me. But that all depends on you being able to touch my shadow. My shadow in the mirror, however, moves with me. I can control it, allowing it to dodge your broken sword,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou are smart. You have learned much about my Mirror Area in such a short amount of time,\u201d Miss Mirror complimented him. Her face remained impassive. \u201cBut even if you do know that, so what? The mirror world is the opposite of our world. You can control your shadow, but it won\u2019t move as naturally as your own body, because every move you make in this world will be reversed in the mirror. And on top of that, you have been blinded. You cannot see your shadow in the mirror, so how do you expect that you will be able to dodge me?\u201d\n\n\u201cTry to attack me again, and you will see for yourself how well I can still dodge.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s composed expression hadn\u2019t changed.\n\nClearly, Miss Mirror wasn\u2019t fond of Han Sen\u2019s attitude. She slashed her sword in the direction of the mirror with one of her rainbows.\n\nThe power of the attack headed for Han Sen\u2019s shadow in the mirror. Han Sen needed to control his movement, guiding his shadow around the incoming attack.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s shadow responded instantly to his every movement, but the reversal of the mirror made it very difficult to control.\n\nNormal people used mirrors to do their makeup or brush their hair. When performing a task that required a person to make extremely precise movements, people who weren\u2019t very experienced with working in mirrors would often make mistakes. Han Sen wasn\u2019t doing anything as simple as brushing his hair, though; he was using a mirror to fight for his life.\n\nHan Sen had to control his reflection to avoid Miss Mirror\u2019s scary attacks. It would be a difficult task at the best of times, and doing so while blinded and injured would be nearly impossible.\n\nBut Miss Mirror, despite running her sword skills at full power, was failing to inflict any more damage on Han Sen\u2019s reflection. She couldn\u2019t land a single strike.\n\n\u201cHow is he doing this?\u201d Miss Mirror wondered, her shock etched deep into her face.\n\nShe knew how hard this had to be, especially since Han Sen had only just become a King. She would never have expected that Han Sen would be able to neutralize her sword skills. After all, she had the experience of a deified. She wasn\u2019t some ordinary King class enemy to him.\n\nNow Han Sen could fight her face to face, and he could control the shadow in the mirror with unbelievable proficiency. She missed each and every attack.\n\nThrough all of this, though, the most amazing thing was that Han Sen was blind. It was hard to imagine how strong his other senses must be to accomplish a feat such as this.\n\nMiss Mirror couldn\u2019t hurt his reflection, and so her sword stopped moving.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, it looks like you cannot hurt me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nMiss Mirror was no longer angry. She had underestimated Han Sen, who was a King. She never thought Han Sen would become an actual threat to her.\n\nBut now, Han Sen\u2019s performance had revealed him as just that: an enemy who could rival her power. He wasn\u2019t just some random King she could slay on a whim.\n\n\u201cYou are very strong. A leftover of the crystallizers is this capable? That is incredibly rare. If it was possible to avoid being your enemy, I would choose to do so,\u201d Miss Mirror said, looking at Han Sen with newfound respect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your enemy, either. Why don\u2019t we re-establish our bonds of cooperation and work to rid ourselves of the red-eye plague?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cWe will, of course. But she must die first,\u201d Miss Mirror said. The muscles in her jaw tightened, and a weird light shimmered. A scary Mirror Area appeared.\n\nHan Sen immediately realized he was now trapped in a mirror maze. Mirrors appeared everywhere he looked. Even the ground and the sky above were just mirror images.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s reflection was in every mirror, as if thousands of Han Sen\u2019s were there. The mirrors reflected each other, creating reflections of Han Sen that stretched back into infinity.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed. Since there were so many reflections, Miss Mirror could strike him with far greater ease now. Han Sen needed to stop her from hitting any one of those reflections. Defending himself had become a much more difficult task now.\n\nAnd it would be even harder to break the old mirrors now, too. He didn\u2019t know if those old mirrors could be broken, but even if they could break, the mirrors would only shatter and create countless more reflections in the shards. Han Sen would be in even more danger, then.\n\n\u201cStill confident that you can dodge my attacks?\u201d Miss Mirror asked as she hung in the center of the Mirror Area.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give it a try. Maybe I can make it work.\u201d Han Sen shrugged.\n\n\u201cYou are so stubborn,\u201d Miss Mirror grunted. With a swing of the broken sword, sword rainbows came to life and went flying at Han Sen through the mirrors.\n\nThere were too many reflections in the mirrors, and Miss Mirror continued to attack without pause or hesitation. Countless reflections would be involved in every single evasion that was required.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart leaped. He summoned Jadeskin and channeled as much power into it as he could. His body became icy jade. His mind opened, and his Jadeskin Area appeared.\n\nHis expression focused, Han Sen jumped, and all of his reflections avoided the incoming sword strike. At the same time, his Jadeskin Area covered all of the old mirrors. Frost spread over the surface of every single mirror.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s useless! Your reflections in the ice are susceptible to my strikes, so I can still use them to kill you.\u201d Miss Mirror slashed towards one of the frozen-over mirrors.\n\n\u201cThe ice won\u2019t work? It looks like this is it, then.\u201d Han Sen sighed. Han Sen withdrew his Jadeskin Area, pulling it all back into his body.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s sword came for one of Han Sen\u2019s reflections again, but this time, Han Sen didn\u2019t dodge.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong!\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s sword struck all of Han Sen\u2019s reflections, but Han Sen just stood where he was. He wasn\u2019t bleeding, and not a single wound appeared across his body. It was like he was a jade statue, resolute and still.\n\n\u201cNot even dust will tarnish my Jadeskin, Miss Mirror. My body is my body. It is mine alone, and nothing in this world will change that. Even if you break all my reflections, you cannot hurt me.\u201d Han Sen held Lady Wan\u2019er while he spoke, his voice frosty."
