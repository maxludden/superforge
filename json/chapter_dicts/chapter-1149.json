Xiang Yin would probably not make it.\n\n\u201cYou lose. Badly! Now, watch as she dies! I am different; I have many more ways to play with you.\u201d Yaksha began to cackle like a mad scientist.\n\n\u201cHow can you be so certain I\u2019ll watch her die?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nYaksha spat out blood and mumbled, \u201cYou are only a little stronger than me. You have only opened nine gene locks; you cannot enter there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who said I\u2019ll need to enter to save her?\u201d Han Sen then brought out his bone xun.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for? Are you going to play a requiem on her behalf? Or perhaps you\u2019re going to somehow play the song of Gandharva?\u201d Yaksha jested in spite.\n\n\u201cI can play that, if that is what you would like to hear.\u201d Han Sen then brought the xun to his lips. He blew into the head, causing a stream of white light to cast its way into the door.\n\nThe power was the same that the xun created, and he used this to recharge her body.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Xiang Yin felt this power enter her body, providing her support before she collapsed completely.\n\nShe only needed a little bit more power to reach the tenth step, and with that power, she had hope.\n\nXiang Yin\u2019s notes filled the air, and her scent re-fragranced the atmosphere. With Han Sen\u2019s help, she was slowly able to move forward and take one last step.\n\n\u201cImpossible! She only played it once. How can you know the song of Gandharva already?!\u201d Yaksha barked.\n\nCarried by the gentle soundwaves of that divine music, Xiang Yin leaned forward, ready to take that last step.\n\n\u201cNo! It should be me who makes that final step!\u201d\n\nYaksha looked insane as he watched Xiang Yin take that one last step.\n\nYaksha\u2019s eyes were going bigger and bigger, unable to believe what he was seeing.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe tenth step was scaled, and when Xiang Yin set both feet on it, a flame ravaged her entire body.\n\nThe light was too bright to witness what was happening now. But it eventually dimmed, and when it did, Han Sen saw her reborn. She looked so holy, like a divine fairy or angelic being.\n\nXiang Yin spoke something to him, but Han Sen could not hear the words. He could only read her lips.\n\nThe door closed, and as it did, Han Sen reviewed the words he believed her to have spoken: \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was not entirely sure that was what she said. She pointed at him as if she wished to say something further, but the door closed before she could.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe door was closed, separating the two for good. Han Sen was depressed, having not even been able to receive a \u201cthank you\u201d for his efforts.\n\nBut Han Sen did not have time to dwell on it. He picked up Yaksha and just said, \u201cYou said you have many ways, right? I can tell you right now that you don\u2019t. I\u2019ll kill you every single time I see you. So, my advice to you is to keep that spirit stone safe. If you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen punched through Yaksha\u2019s skull and tossed his body away. Yaksha\u2019s body faded from sight, warping him back to his spirit stone.\n\nWhen he respawned, he mulled over the words Han Sen had spoken to him. Han Sen\u2019s speech was one of remarkable confidence, and it made Yaksha angry to realize that he was now the weaker one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you regret this.\u201d Yaksha left his shelter, making this one final vow.\n\nHan Sen decided to make his way out of the underground realm. He exited his super king spirit mode, and his body was exhausted. So, he called for Golden Growler to carry him back.\n\nNot long after, Han Sen came across the Blue Dinosaur and Queen. Queen looked incredibly relieved to see Han Sen.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the shelter as soon as we can,\u201d Queen said, as she ran over to hold Han Sen in her arms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back. Those *sshole super creatures tried to kill me, so I\u2019m going to exact my revenge.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for the super creatures getting involved, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t be in such a condition.\n\nHe recalled their names and knew he had to kill them.\n\n\u201cThey lead armies of noobs. That\u2019s it. And when they recover, I\u2019m going to make light work of them,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen set up a camp outside the cave\u2019s exit, and when he recovered, he thought of going after the rat king first. He wanted to take its Life Geno Essence.\n\nA few days later, he was back in tip-top shape. With Blue Dinosaur, he returned to the underground."
