    "text": "The Red Blood Demon wasn\u2019t like ordinary primitive deifieds. Not even Han Sen\u2019s Apollo Set would be enough to let him fight the creature.\n\nHan Sen had already stated his intentions. He was going to kill the Red Blood Demon. Han Sen acted as if it would be the simplest thing in the world, but to any of the Very High, it would have sounded like he was daydreaming.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then feel free to wait around. It isn\u2019t my time that\u2019s being wasted, after all.\u201d Han Sen shrugged, as if he didn\u2019t care one way or another.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen settled himself next to the stone pavilion to rest. The damaged Apollo Set would take a while to recover, as well.\n\nFortunately, the Apollo Set was good at mending damage it had sustained. If it hadn\u2019t possessed such advanced self-repair abilities, it would have been a pile of scrap metal already.\n\n\u201cRed Blood Demon\u2019s fighting abilities are overpowered. If I was already a primitive deified, killing it would be easy. But right now, as I am, depending on the power of treasures will make it very difficult for me to bring this beast down.\u201d Han Sen kept thinking about how he fought before. He was trying to find a way in which he might kill the Red Blood Demon.\n\nBecause Exquisite and Li Keer had been focusing on practicing Under the Sky, they hadn\u2019t been visiting Han Sen very often. Han Sen thought that he was right on the precipice of his chance to succeed. He just needed to find a chance to fight the Red Blood Demon when they were not around. Then, he could use whichever geno art or beast soul he fancied.\n\nLi Xue Cheng frowned. The Very High were very strict about their rules. Even though he was one of the Very High, he couldn\u2019t circumvent the rules.\n\nIf Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to give up, Li Xue Cheng really would have to wait another month. If Han Sen couldn\u2019t kill the Red Blood Demon before the time limit, Li Xue Cheng could register for permission to enter and slay the fiend.\n\nBut Li Xue Cheng was being hung to dry. He was in a rush to get as many resources as possible, so he didn\u2019t want to wait a month.\n\nHe rolled his eyes. He walked to the stone pavilion, looked at Han Sen, and said, \u201cYou said you will find a way to kill the Red Blood Demon, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod. He had been fighting the Red Blood Demon for a while now, and he hadn\u2019t really gotten much out of it, other than a general understanding of the Red Blood Demon\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said, nodding to himself. Then, he turned around and left. That surprised Han Sen. He wasn\u2019t sure what the man meant by that.\n\nHan Sen had thought Li Xue Cheng would hang around and annoy him for a while, but the man left without another word. Han Sen thought about the expression he had seen on Li Xue Cheng\u2019s face, though. It was unlikely that the man would give up so easily.\n\nLi Xue Cheng left Jail Demon Hall to seek out Liyu Zhen.\n\n\u201cYou know that Han Sen has been in Jail Demon Hall trying to kill the Red Blood Demon, right?\u201d Li Xue Cheng asked Liyu Zhen.\n\n\u201cSo? Does it matter whether I know this or not?\u201d Liyu Zhen was annoyed by just hearing Han Sen\u2019s name. He had lost so much on his wager during the silkworm fights. Although his family had paid off much of the debt, he still had a lot he needed to repay. Paying it all off would be incredibly difficult.\n\nAt this time, Liyu Zhen was in no mood to wonder about what Han Sen was doing. Just thinking about how to pay off all of his debts was enough to make his head explode.\n\n\u201cI was going to ask for someone\u2019s help to kill the Red Blood Demon and gather more resources, but Han Sen registered to kill the Red Blood Demon before I did. I need to wait another month before I can register,\u201d Li Xue Cheng explained what had happened.\n\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Liyu Zhen didn\u2019t understand why Li Xue Cheng was bothering to tell him all this. The Very High were strict when it came to the law. The two young men had no choice but to abide by them. If Han Sen had already registered for permission to hunt, then as long as he didn\u2019t concede, no one could go there and attempt to steal his kill.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, he has been in the Jail Demon Hall for a while. He has been fighting the Red Blood Demon every day. I don\u2019t think he can actually kill the Red Blood Demon. I think he wants to use the Red Blood Demon to practice his fighting skills. I think he will keep going until his time there is up,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said.\n\n\u201cIs there a problem with that? Many of our people do the same thing.\u201d Liyu Zhen still didn\u2019t understand what Li Xue Cheng was talking about, but he knew the other man had to be hinting at something.\n\nUpon hearing Liyu Zhen say this, Li Xue Cheng laughed. But there was something sinister in the sound of his laugh. He said, \u201cYou know that many students of our race have done this in the past. Why have fewer attempted such a thing in recent years?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because\u2026\u201d Liyu Zhen trailed off halfway through his response. He now understood what Li Xue Cheng was getting at. He looked at Li Xue Cheng with shock and said, \u201cYou want to use the glitch in Jail Demon Hall to kill Han Sen? That isn\u2019t very nice. If the rest of our people find out, it will be considered a huge crime. We might end up being exiled to confinement on a small and empty island.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if Han Sen activated the glitch himself. If that happened, it would have nothing to do with us,\u201d Li Xue Cheng grinned darkly. He then went on to say, \u201cHe was the reason that we lost everything. Are you really going to sit back and accept that?\u201d\n\n\u201cJail Demon Hall\u2019s restrictions originally weren\u2019t as strong as the real body of the Red Blood Demon. Because of that, the beast almost managed to escape. When it was realized how close the Red Blood Demon came to escaping, our elders added another security measure to guarantee that the Red Blood Demon could never break free. If the doppelganger gains enough power to break out of the first level of restrictions, then the extra security protocol goes into effect. Jail Demon Hall instantly goes into complete lockdown. A long time ago, one of our primitive deified warriors was battling the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon became enraged and activated that special restriction. When the Jail Demon Hall went into lockdown, it trapped that primitive deified inside. He was unable to teleport away. When they opened Jail Demon Hall again, they found that the Red Blood Demon had already eaten the man. All that was left of him was a little blood on the floor.\u201d\n\nLiyu Zhen said quietly, \u201cBut when that happened, they decided to modify the restrictions. They increased the level of power needed to trigger it. Unless the Red Blood Demon went completely nuts, I don\u2019t think it would be able to trigger that security measure again. Han Sen can\u2019t really threaten the Red Blood Demon, so there\u2019s no way he could inspire that much fury in the creature. So, how could he trigger the glitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he isn\u2019t able to do it, we can help him. Every time he leaves the hall, he\u2019s badly injured. He uses Very High geno fluids to heal. You\u2019ve met the man before, and you have a connection to the current situation that I think we can exploit. I\u2019m sure you can give him some better geno fluid to recover, right?\u201d Li Xue Cheng said.\n\n\u201cYou mean like Blood Marrow Geno Fluid?\u201d Liyu Zhen\u2019s eyes brightened. Now he knew what Li Xue Cheng really meant.\n\nBlood Marrow Geno Fluid was made from the Red Blood Demon\u2019s xenogeneic genes. It was very good for recovering from injuries. Of all the healing geno fluids that existed, it was one of the priciest. It was usually used by deified elites.\n\nIt worked very well for deified wounds, so its efficiency with Kings went without saying. As long as a person wasn\u2019t dead, they could be healed in a short amount of time.\n\nBut not many knew that because the Blood Marrow Geno Fluid was made from the Red Blood Demon\u2019s xenogeneic genes, the Red Blood Demon was very sensitive to it. Using a small amount wouldn\u2019t have much of an effect. But if Han Sen used too much and then entered Jail Demon Hall, it might trigger the true ire of the Red Blood Demon."
