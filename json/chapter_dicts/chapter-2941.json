    "text": "Han Sen\u2019s heart felt that chill. It seemed like his eyes were shutting, and he had no control over them. It was different from how it felt when he faced the nine-eyed sword. This time, Han Sen not only felt tired, but his will also seemed to be blurry.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder that is a god personality armament. It is much stronger than that nine-eyed sword.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s will was like steel, so it was not easy for Nine Thousand King\u2019s god personality armament to try and control him. The big goldfish was affected by the rabid power. Its will was not so clear. It swam toward the pavilion.\n\n\u201cNine Thousand King, do you really think I, Han Sen, am rubbish?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face looked calm. Almost at the same time, he vanished. In the next second, he was in front of Nine Thousand King with his knife directly before his neck.\n\nAlthough Nine Thousand King was rather afraid of Han Sen, he was even more afraid of Sacred Leader. He would rather fight Han Sen than risk touching an object left behind by Sacred Leader. He did not want to get hurt by it.\n\nNine Thousand King lifted his left arm to block Han Sen\u2019s knife. With the Thousand Eye Battle Armor, he did not have to be afraid of Han Sen\u2019s knife. The other fist gathered up some weird power and released some green light through an eye. He was attacking Han Sen\u2019s belly.\n\nNine Thousand King suddenly noticed that his arm and his fists were still a foot away from Han Sen. He could not get close.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knife slashed across his unprotected neck. His neck had a wound that revealed the bone inside.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cIt is no wonder he is a true god that\u2019s top-class. My full power attack only cut his skin. I cannot even break his bone.\u201d His hand did not stop.\n\nHan Sen was like a god demon as he waved the cause karma knife. The knife lights slashed across each other. Every knife slashed across Nine Thousand King\u2019s neck.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s body kept changing. He was trying to block or dodge Han Sen\u2019s knife lights. He shockingly discovered that no matter how fast he was, he could not dodge or block the attacks. It was like he had been made terribly slow.\n\n\u201cTime area!\u201d Nine Thousand King shockingly screamed. He saw what power Han Sen was using now.\n\nHan Sen was so cold. He did not say anything. He kept on slashing and slashing. Nine Thousand King\u2019s neck wound was getting deeper and deeper. Even the bone had been given a few deep marks. God blood kept flowing. The purple fire on the wound kept spreading. That was teeth power\u2019s power.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s armor kept flickering with a weird light. In the time area, although they were only a foot away from each other, nothing it did landed on Han Sen.\n\nGod blood was oozing. Nine Thousand King was triggered. He madly asked, \u201cHan Sen, do you really think you can do whatever you want with a time area? Today, I will let you know why I am called Nine Thousand King.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes moved. He saw Nine Thousand King had some weird shadow. That shadow was like some angry demon crawling out of hell. It looked extremely murderous. It made people feel a chill by just looking at it.\n\nWhen that mad demon shadow came out, Nine Thousand King\u2019s entire body was like an erupting volcano. He expanded a lot. Some weird atmosphere covered the holy garden.\n\n\u201cOne second is a thousand years!\u201d Nine Thousand King madly shouted. All the weird eyes on the armor opened. The eye lights went past the time area to strike Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCan it break the time area restrictions? What kind of geno art is that?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He teleported away from Nine Thousand King to dodge the light.\n\n\u201cOne second is a thousand years. I can turn a thousand into one second. No matter how strong your time area is, you cannot black my One Second Is a Thousand Years.\u201d Nine Thousand King coldly looked at Han Sen. His body exploded with light. This time, the light on his armor was like a weird and green sun. It shone across the holy garden. If Han Sen did not leave, he was going to be hit with the light.\n\nHan Sen knew that Nine Thousand King said what he did about one second being a thousand years was most likely a bluff. He could probably only do one second for a year. Even so, it broke his time area, which was a difficult thing to do.\n\nWhen the eye light came down, there was nowhere to go to avoid it. Han Sen could not leave the holy garden. All he could do was rely on the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze to block the scary eye light.\n\nThe goldfish family arrived at the stone pavilion, but the stone pavilion could not block the light. The two of them were controlled by the eye light. Their eyes became green lightbulbs, and their bodies swam toward Wan\u2019er\u2019s statue.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He used the shield, but he could only protect himself and Bao\u2019er with it. He could not protect the goldfish family with it.\n\nThe worst off, however, was Yang Yun Sheng. He was already heavily injured and lying on the floor. He was unable to get up. Now, he was affected by the Thousand Eye Battle Armor. His eyes became lightbulbs. Ignoring his wounds, he somehow got up and flew to the stone pavilion.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang!\n\nThere were three loud noises. The goldfish family and Yang Yun Sheng had barely touched the clothes of the statue and been sent flying across the holy garden.\n\nYang Yun Sheng was injured. Even though he was controlled by the Thousand Eye Battle Armor, he could no longer get up. He was covered in blood. The goldfish family was injured too, but their injuries were not as severe.\n\n\u201cOne second is a thousand years!\u201d Nine Thousand King shouted. The Thousand Eye Battle Armor released a scary eye light again.\n\nHan Sen noticed that Nine Thousand King\u2019s silver hair was looking a bit white, and his skin had a few wrinkles. He suddenly understood and said, \u201cThis old man\u2019s one second is a thousand years will speed up his own time too. The more he speeds up, the older he gets. This geno art will spend his lifespan. It is no wonder he did not use it until now. He did not dare to use it freely. He only uses it during important moments.\u201d\n\nJust as Han Sen thought, Nine Thousand King\u2019s One Second Is a Thousand Years sped up the time of others and his own time. If he kept using One Second Is a Thousand Years, Han Sen would not even have to fight. The man would just grow old and die.\n\n\u201cWeird. Nine Thousand King\u2019s original power is not time. How can he use a time geno art like One Second Is a Thousand Years?\u201d Han Sen started to think it was weird, so he checked Nine Thousand King out.\n\nUnder the power and influence of the Thousand Eye Battle Armor, the goldfish family hit the statue again. This time, Nine Thousand King used more power. The big goldfish was not supposed to be controlled easily, but the big goldfish had rabid power. It meant its will was not so clear. It was worse than the small goldfish. It sped up to the statue.\n\nPang!\n\nThe big goldfish\u2019s body hit the statue. The statue moved a little. The big goldfish\u2019s body flew away again.\n\nAt the same time, the statue had some holy light."
