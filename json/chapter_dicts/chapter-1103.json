It was a name that exuded a sort of grace or elegance, but in all truth, the name betrayed the fighter\u2019s true self. He was an eight-meter-tall spirit of mighty power and stone.\n\nWith each step he took, a crude imprint was left behind in his wake. And with each thumping footstep, the earth quaked.\n\nThe humans that watched were in shock. Whenever a royal spirit\u2019s weapon collided with the ground, not a scratch was made. But here, all it took was the spirit\u2019s footsteps to ruin the floor and leave holes.\n\n\u201cHe seems pretty strong. Is Dollar going to be okay facing that thing?\u201d someone wondered.\n\nSu Xiaoqiao responded, saying, \u201cWhen has Dollar ever lost? If he can kill Fei Yu King so effortlessly, he can most certainly kill this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. How can he lose? It was silly of me to doubt.\u201d A bright hopefulness returned to the person\u2019s face.\n\nHumans had been bullied in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary for far too long, so they were all eager to see a human stand in the face of their adversity and show that it was possible to fight back.\n\nDollar\u2019s performance so far had shocked a great number of humans. What had occurred was a miracle they had long wanted to see; they didn\u2019t want it snuffed out anytime soon.\n\nHan Sen had no idea what discussions were being held about his performance. He was oblivious to it all. Before the fight, though, he returned to the Alliance so he could relax and regenerate lost strength by bathing in a recovery pool. He wanted to be able to use super king spirit mode longer if he needed to.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s communicator rang while he was there, and when he picked it up, he saw that it was Queen giving him a call.\n\n\u201cDid you go to the shelter yet?\u201d Queen asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m currently bathing. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d Han Sen waved his phone around to give her a look at where he was.\n\nQueen said, \u201cWell, hurry back. Dollar has joined Divinity\u2019s Bout. He killed a king spirit, and not only that, the following three opponents bowed and threw the match in fear of him. Three royal spirits! It\u2019s insane. He\u2019s fighting another king spirit later.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re going to the Martial Hall?\u201d If Queen was already in the shelter, waiting in the Martial Hall, it meant she would see him entering the battlegrounds. That would mean only one thing; Dollar\u2019s identity would be revealed!\n\nBut Queen said, \u201cI will. But I\u2019m in another empty shelter, so I can\u2019t return to yours just yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t interested in watching that thing.\u201d Han Sen felt relief.\n\nQueen, so far, had shown an insatiable lust for leveling up. It was all she had concerned herself with since he encountered her in the Third God\u2019s Shelter. It was almost as if she had to stay in a state of constant motion.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t. But previously, there was no hope. And I would have rather spent the time improving myself. But Dollar killed a king spirit; a feat thought to be unachievable by one man. He deserves to be watched.\u201d\n\nQueen went on to implore Han Sen, \u201cYou must come and watch, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nQueen told him, \u201cBecause I\u2019ll fix you. Maybe one day you\u2019ll be as strong as Dollar, fighting in Divinity\u2019s Bout.\u201d\n\nQueen quickly hung up after that and went to the shelter.\n\nHan Sen gave a wry smile. His time for relaxation was practically over, and it was time for battle. He exited the pool, put his armor on, and teleported back.\n\nAncient Jade continued standing in his spot as a spirit conceded before him. It wasn\u2019t a royal spirit, though. He lacked the charms to make royal spirits concede.\n\nHan Sen had worked hard to reach his status and prestige as The King. The fact others were willing to obey or concede to him was due to his incredible performance throughout the spirit bases, where he was believed to be invincible. He was an attractive idol to a great number of spirits.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived in the Martial Hall, Ancient Jade King was on the battleground already. He was waiting.\n\nThere was still some time left, though. And Han Sen spent this time observing his next opponent.\n\nIt was going to be quite difficult to kill a nine gene lock king spirit in a mere thirty minutes.\n\nAfter what happened with Fei Yu King, Han Sen guessed future king spirits would treat The King like an actual threat. He didn\u2019t think he could one-hit-kill Fei Yu King so easily.\n\nFurthermore, Taia and Phoenix Sword could not be used. Gold Raven, Disloyal Knight, and Golden Growler couldn\u2019t be used, either.\n\nAll he could use was Devil Pill. With the time to join almost up, he turned into a super king spirit and walked out onto the stage to face his next opponent.\n\nSpirits and humans alike were shouting and chanting, all in Han Sen\u2019s support.\n\nSeeing Han Sen walk out, Ancient Jade King flashed with a light of varying colors. A stone wall manifested out of the earth, shielding him in a barricade of rock.\n\n\u201cYour coins are useless against me,\u201d Ancient Jade King called out from within his shelter of stone.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Han Sen clicked his fingers. From out of thin air, coins began to descend from the sky in a torrent like rain.\n\nAncient Jade King bolstered the strength of his walls and raised them higher to prevent the coins from touching him. When too many coins built up on the rock, it shattered.\n\nThis was something the spirit had prepared for, though. When the wall was just about to buckle and crumble entirely, another wall was ready to swap with its position. No coin seemed able to touch Ancient Jade King.\n\n\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Ancient Jade King coldly laughed as he taunted Han Sen, figuring he had overcome Han Sen\u2019s signature move.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything in response, though. In his hand, he wielded a black sword.\n\nThe sword was wreathed in a holy light, and with a thrust, it came barreling towards Ancient Jade King."
