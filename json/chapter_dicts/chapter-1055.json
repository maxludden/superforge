The lad is out of his mind!\u201d\n\n\u201cA human with that measly level of fitness chose to fight with our prince? How stupid is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman bro, let me teach you a skill. It involves spinning your body repeatedly. If you do that, you might last a few seconds longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should make use of the Toyama theory, and use the landscape and geography of the arena to his advantage. Oh, wait a minute\u2026 the arena is flat. May God have mercy on his soul.\u201d\n\nThe shura thought Han Sen\u2019s decision to engage in this fight was so far beyond dumb, it was unwittingly hilarious. They mockingly devised methods how the human on stage might last a little longer. The stream was a meme-field.\n\nLou Lan laughed and said, \u201cAre we positive this kid didn\u2019t just come here to waste our time just to have a laugh?\u201d\n\nLian Chan commented, \u201cHe\u2019s only just become a surpasser, hasn\u2019t he? What other kind of performance can we expect?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him. This human is strong,\u201d an elderly shura dourly said from beside Lou Lan.\n\nThe two looked at the old shura and said, \u201cUncle Gu Na? Isn\u2019t he far weaker than the prince, though?\u201d\n\nGu Na shook his head and said nothing more. He kept his eyes fixed on Han Sen, watching him with keen interest.\n\nWithout a reply, an unease settled on the minds of the two shura ladies. They did not say anything more, either.\n\nGu Na was the only one there who was not a royal shura, but he was two hundred years old. For the white-horned shura that he was, the third rank was the highest rank that could be achieved.\n\nSo, while Gu Na was merely an elite soldier, it was something that had not denied him a valiant history. He had participated in numerous battles over the years, and he had received a number of medals for the incredible service and heroics deeds he had performed.\n\nHe had been chosen for the expedition into the crystallizer ruins because he was very powerful, in a capacity that did not exceed the maximum allowed ballpark of strength for the people who went. He also had extensive experience and had seen much, over the course of his long lifetime.\n\nStill, due to his lower hierarchical prestige and age, the younger sorts like Lou Lan and Lian Chan didn\u2019t often care for the words he spoke.\n\nYu Tuoshan threw a punch in Han Sen\u2019s direction again. It came fast and hard.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t seem keen to dodge, however, and decided to meet his opponent\u2019s fist with his own.\n\nThe humans believed Han Sen was being stupid, trying to push in such a manner. They believed he was foolish in trying to match the shura\u2019s strength directly.\n\n\u201cI fear we already know who has won, as if it wasn\u2019t obvious beforehand,\u201d Zhao Yongbo said dismally.\n\nJi Hailan said nothing, but Han Sen\u2019s behavior was strange.\n\nOnly Bai Yishan looked at Han Sen with a modicum of happiness.\n\nOthers may not have recognized the punch Han Sen was using, but he did. And that was because he was the one who had created Yin Yang Blast.\n\nIt was a dangerous talent. As such, its learning was forbidden, and it seemed likely that ruling would stand for a long time to come.\n\nBai Yishan felt a great sense of pride and accomplishment whenever he saw someone use a technique he had created. This was especially true for Yin Yang Blast.\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t understand exactly how Han Sen proposed to block or deflect the shura\u2019s punch with this strike.\n\nYin Yang Blast was only effective against enemies that were of the same tier as the caster. Everyone thought Han Sen was considerably weaker, and as such, he thought the power of the skill would be squandered.\n\nBut Bai Yishan also knew something else, and that was about Han Sen\u2019s character. He knew Han Sen was a highly proficient fighter, and his head was always screwed on correctly. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t do anything that might result in his loss, so he put the doubts out of his mind out and waited for what was to unfold. He wanted to see how far the skill could go.\n\nWhen the moment of collision came, Han Sen\u2019s fist opened up to reveal his palm. In a split-second, he changed his method of attack to grab Yu Tuoshan\u2019s fist.\n\nTo the onlookers, it seemed like a pointless change. The general assumption was that fists were always stronger than palms.\n\nYu Tuoshan believed Han Sen had underestimated him snidely, so he resolved to hit his opponent even harder.\n\nBut when the fist came into contact with the palm, everyone was shocked.\n\nThere was no noise; it was as if the force of Yu Tuoshan\u2019s incoming fist had simply refused to exist and had canceled itself. There Han Sen stood, with his fingers wrapped around the shura\u2019s fist firmly.\n\nAnd then, with a slight movement, Yu Tuoshan\u2019s entire body was cast away like a doll.\n\nBoom!\n\nYu Tuoshan\u2019s body was thrown through the reinforced glass that separated the stage from the audience and crashed into a few chairs.\n\nEveryone was shocked, unable to believe what had just happened. The way the shura had been tossed away seemed so very easy and light, as if he was no heavier than a crumpled piece of paper to Han Sen.\n\nLian Chan\u2019s eyes were wide open in bewilderment.\n\nThe viewers of the stream had all gone quiet, and an unsettling silence began to choke the viewers both online and offline. Their all-powerful prince had been chucked away by a human. In the aftermath of such a shock, not one word was spoken or typed.\n\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Bai Yishan was the one to break the gripping quiet, and he sounded far happier now than he did whenever he won fights of his own.\n\nBut Bai Yishan wasn\u2019t just happy over Han Sen\u2019s victory, he was overjoyed in seeing that the skill he had developed could be dexterous enough to overcome and defeat a shura."
