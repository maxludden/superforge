The bird was swift with its talons, though, and it grabbed the trunk neatly. Then, with a quick turn, the elephant was pulled upwards into the sea.\n\nThe elephant struggled the best it could, not wanting to go with it. But its resistance was futile, and it kept on getting pulled until the gravity flipped and it fell into the blue.\n\nHan Sen wished to stop it. The elephant was his prey, and Han Sen had exhausted quite a bit of effort in trying to defeat it mano-a-mano. But unfortunately for him, the bird was too fast, and it was too late for Han Sen to stop its snatch.\n\nThe bird disappeared beneath the surface of the sea, taking the elephant with it.\n\nStrangely, Han Sen noticed something else this time, though. He saw the bird transform into a fish the moment it took back to the water.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014? That thing is just like the red bird. It can turn into a fish when it takes to water?\u201d Han Sen frowned, as a few other thoughts and theories crossed his mind.\n\nPerhaps it was because the elephant had been born in the area, but Han Sen noticed it had not been taken under and finished off. In the water, it was left alone by the fish-bird and allowed to swim towards the peak of the mountain which touched the water.\n\nBut before it could get there, the fish opened its mouth that was laden with teeth and took a big bite out of the elephant, then swallowed it.\n\nThe elephant was bleeding profusely following the bite, but overall, the wound was mild.\n\nThen, the fish opened its mouth again. And almost to its surprise, the hardy elephant began thrashing at the waves of the upset sea.\n\nHan Sen did not expect them both to be fighting in such a manner.\n\nBut regardless of what might have been occurring, the elephant was at a disadvantage. It might have been able to swim, but it wasn\u2019t very proficient with the act. And no matter how strong it was, it wouldn\u2019t last very long in the tumultuous water.\n\nJust as Han Sen thought this was about to end, though, a howl came from someplace on the mountain.\n\nThere was a white turtle, the size of a mortar, swimming towards the two that were engaged in a fit of battle.\n\nHan Sen took a closer look at what was going on and noticed there were in fact six turtles. They had all come to assist the elephant.\n\nThey were all super creatures, too. They had not opened their tenth gene locks, but their shells were sturdy. Whenever the fish-bird tried to peck them, they\u2019d pull their heads and limbs back inside their shells, the defensive properties of which seemed ample enough to protect them.\n\nThe fish-bird also received a few bites from the pesky turtles, amidst the rumble that was currently on-going.\n\nWith the helping hand it received, the elephant was able to reassert control over itself and continue its struggle to swim towards the safety of the mountain.\n\nThe fish looked angry over the intrusion and the fact that the elephant was getting away. So, it turned into a bird once more and grabbed two turtles in its beak, then it tossed them into the sky.\n\nHan Sen heard two katcha noises, indicating their fall was not a pleasant one. Taking a look, he was able to see that the shells of the two unfortunate turtles had been wholly broken.\n\nThe other four turtles thought it best that they now scram, and so they did. They returned to the mountain as hastily as they had left it.\n\nThe bird was not keen on letting them and their transgressions get away scot-free, so it tried going after them. The turtles were small, though, and try as the fish-bird might, circling the mountain from above, it lost sight of them. So then, it turned towards another target. It was going to go for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen knew it was not a foe to be trifled with or underestimated, so he kept his ten gene locks open in anticipation of its coming assault. Lotus Empress prepared herself to fight, too, while the Fish King readied itself for a departure to the sea above.\n\nBut then, the strangest thing occurred. Just as Han Sen was ready to unleash a barrage of attacks upon the approaching bird, it stopped short of him and dropped two dead turtles on the ground before him.\n\nThe bird let out a brief squawk and returned to the sea, motionless. It appeared just as it used to, when it had been following Han Sen and his companions on their journey.\n\nNeedless to say, everyone was a little taken aback. They were shocked to see the bird-fish had delivered two of its kills to Han Sen.\n\nLotus Empress was very confused, in particular.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I was wrong. Perhaps that wasn\u2019t Sea Ghost after all.\u201d Lotus frowned, after issuing her best attempt at an explanation.\n\nHan Sen looked at the red bird next, and thought to himself, \u201cThey can both shapeshift between bird and fish. Perhaps they\u2019re related? Maybe the big bird-fish wants to take care of the little red birdy-fish.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t going to let the turtles go to waste, so the next thing Han Sen did was pick them up.\n\nAfter removing their shells, he received another two Life Geno Essences. After that, he cleaned up the flesh and gutted them, then prepared them as food. If their flesh was edible, that would prove they were second generation super creatures.\n\nSea Ghost continued trailing Han Sen and his fellows after that, but it did not attack.\n\nUnder its protection, for that was what they now assumed it was, they reached the island in safety and without further incident.\n\n\u201cWhy is Sea Ghost protecting us, I wonder?\u201d Lotus Empress asked Han Sen.\n\nShe thought he might have an answer, but the truth was, he didn\u2019t. And not being sure of what Sea Ghost was thinking, he could not reply. So, instead, he decided to ask Bai Yishan something.\n\nWhen he became a surpasser, he was sent to an abandoned shelter near the Endless Sea. The path they traversed was a shortcut he himself had devised and developed.\n\nBai Yishan told Han Sen about the Elephant Sutra and the research he had been conducting, and then asked Han Sen what he had been practicing.\n\n\u201cProfessor, you cannot abandon your research. There\u2019s something really tangible behind all this. There is a meaning to your research. As for what I have learned, it is a skill of the Xue family. It is not suitable for just anyone to learn, however. If your research and development of a new hyper geno art is a success, it will benefit humanity. I know it will. Don\u2019t give it up,\u201d Han Sen said, with a soft and reassuring voice."
