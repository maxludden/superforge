It was his once-classmate Lu Meng, from the Blackhark Military Academy.\n\n\u201cI am meeting with Professor Bai. Why are you here? I thought you became a Vice-Captain for Heavenly Machine.\u201d Han Sen saw Lu Meng, dressed in a Saint Hall uniform.\n\nTheir 304 living quarter roommates were still in contact with each other. They didn\u2019t see each other much, but they knew what they were each up to. Han Sen, however, did not expect to see Lu Meng there in the Saint Hall.\n\n\u201cHeavenly Machine was shot down by the shura. I was going to go serve on another ship, but my mother has forbidden me from doing so. Instead, I have decided to become a researcher at Saint Hall.\u201d Lu Meng spoke with maturity, and an elegance that was not over-bearing. He was far from the kid Han Sen once knew.\n\n\u201cSomething that big occurred? Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Han Sen looked legitimately shocked.\n\n\u201cWell, had I died, you\u2019d have been informed. I walked away fine, so there was no point in worrying others. It\u2019s a waste of time for those who worry and a waste of time for those who are worried over.\u201d Lu Meng smiled softly for a moment, and then went on to say, \u201cI heard you were injured, though. How are you, all things considered?\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d Han Sen said, enjoying the chat with Lu Meng.\n\nThe two proceeded to speak about recent events, and gossip as they had not done for the longest time. They discussed older topics too, in blissful nostalgia. They spoke of their school lives, and what was going on with Zhang Yang, Shi Zhikang, Wang Mengmeng, Fat Leader, and Thin Man, even.\n\nBai Yishan reached the lobby, at which point the closure of their dialogue was abruptly delivered.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, come to my office,\u201d Bai Yishan swiftly commanded. When he recognized who Han Sen was talking with, though, he had to ask, \u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cLu Meng was my roommate once upon a time, and he is a good friend. He was a bit of a bully during my study years, though. You better put a tight leash on this fellow, if you\u2019re teaching him,\u201d Han Sen jested.\n\nBai Yishan looked at Lu Meng\u2019s card and said, \u201cYou are an intern. Hm, come to my lab tomorrow. Find Mister Li and he\u2019ll put you to work.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan seemed to be in a rush, though, and so he said, \u201cNow come, quickly. There is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, buddy.\u201d Han Sen followed after Bai Yishan, concerned what matter could be so pressing.\n\nLu Meng winked at Han Sen and then watched him go. It was rare for someone to work alongside Bai Yishan in his lab. Even the most experienced researchers could be forbidden from entering there, if Bai Yishan had no desire for them to have access.\n\nIt was an extremely fortuitous opportunity, being invited to enter the lab. But he knew that if he was to act on the invitation, he\u2019d have to be at his best performance. If he didn\u2019t have what it took, he could be removed from the lab with a snap of the fingers.\n\nThe invitation meant one thing above all else, though. And that was Bai Yishan\u2019s favor and respect for Han Sen. Usually, a rigorous testing process was required before someone could enter such a prestigious lab. His association with Han Sen seemed to suggest Lu Meng could forego that.\n\nBai Yishan brought Han Sen into his office and presented him with a set of documents.\n\n\u201cSaint Hall has a rule. There is a program here, one we must all follow. Sign this document, and you can be made councilor of this project. You know this is classified, yes?\u201d Bai Yishan said.\n\nHan Sen read the document in front of him, and then signed atop the dotted line.\n\n\u201cSo, what is this project? Why is there so much mystery?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he signed his name.\n\nBai Yishan sent the document before responding. He contacted someone to confirm Han Sen\u2019s identity and said, \u201cCome to my lab; we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan printed off Han Sen\u2019s worker card and pinned it to his chest.\n\nBai Yishan seemed to be in a hurry, and he was scurrying about with haste. Even his speech was quicker than usual. He said, \u201cYou asked me if there is a hyper geno art that can make a stomach stronger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou created one for me?\u201d Han Sen was surprised, and performed an emotional gesture with both hands clasped.\n\nBai Yishan rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re my son, boy. I\u2019m not going to treat you that well.\u201d\n\nHan Sen immediately looked disappointed, and instead asked for clarification. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the big deal about my asking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am researching a hyper geno art called Hidden Blood. It might be something you\u2019d have an interest in,\u201d Bai Yishan explained.\n\n\u201cHidden Blood? To make your heart stronger?\u201d Han Sen was disappointed. He already had Heresy Mantra for his heart, so there was no need for any other such skills or techniques.\n\nBut Bai Yishan shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not for your heart. It\u2019s for your spleen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpleen?\u201d Han Sen knew the word but did not know much about it. The best he could recall was that it was an organ associated with the filtering of blood or something.\n\nBai Yishan elucidated it for him, saying, \u201cThe spleen can filter blood and create blood.\u201d\n\nHan Sen listened to what Bai Yishan told him with interest as he walked alongside the man. He could understand a few words, here and there. Han Sen was more interested in Saving Money, though. He didn\u2019t concern himself too much with hyper geno arts that dealt with organs of the body.\n\nThat being said, Han Sen was surprised to find himself interested in Hidden Blood, after hearing what Bai Yishan was telling him about it. If what he was saying was true, it had to be a powerful hyper geno art. It had to be one that would be quite beneficial for Han Sen.\n\nWhen they finally reached the lab, Han Sen was taken aback. It had to be bigger than the size of a football stadium. Aside from a few enclosed areas, the entire lab was partitioned by glass windows, where you could observe the researchers going about their various tasks.\n\n\u201cThere is a problem with it, though. I was hoping you might be able to help us with it,\u201d Bai Yishan said as they entered a private room.\n\n\u201cWhat would this help entail?\u201d Han Sen asked dubiously, as he looked at Bai Yishan. The man\u2019s crooked smile was like that of an old, wicked fox."
