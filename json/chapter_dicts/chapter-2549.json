Purple air rose from the hands in streams that flowed like venomous snakes, and they drilled through Han Sen\u2019s body. The purple air bound him, preventing him from moving.\n\nWhen they saw the armored man grab Han Sen, Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng were in shock. Gu Qingcheng\u2019s heart leaped into her throat. She lifted her hands, and thousands of old swords appeared around her. They went soaring over to strike the armored man.\n\nGleaming blades rained down like a waterfall. Even a planet would be riddled with holes after weathering a storm of those blades.\n\nBut the armored man was able to hold Han Sen with one hand and use the other hand to punch through the swordstream that was all around him. The power of that punch flew all the way back to Gu Qingcheng, but it was stopped by the sudden appearance of Elysian Moon\u2019s umbrella shield.\n\nPang!\n\nThat punch broke the swordlight that her umbrella had formed. The armored man gathered strength in his fist again, preparing to attack Gu Qingcheng once more.\n\n\u201cStop! How dare you be so rude to those two girls. Go back!\u201d Ji Yang Sheng shouted. He had arrived just in time, riding a robotic demon wolf. The armored man lowered its fist and retreated.\n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m so late and ended up scaring you, girls.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng smiled at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.\n\n\u201cSo you were the one behind all this,\u201d Elysian Moon said, giving Ji Yang Sheng an icy stare.\n\n\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m just here doing what is right of me to do.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng looked at the armored man holding Han Sen. He smiled and said, \u201cTeacher Han, we meet again. You should have the time to talk to me now, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Ji, I don\u2019t think you have gauged my personality correctly.\u201d Han Sen was being held firmly by the armored man. Purple smoke covered him, and he couldn\u2019t even move his fingers. His face remained impassive, though.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng looked at Han Sen with interest. He looked like a cat playing with a mouse.\n\n\u201cSir, just in case, we should take Han Sen to our core area base,\u201d the Demon King said.\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cHe is right. I have a very bad temper. You better do it quick; otherwise, you won\u2019t have the chance.\u201d\n\nJi Yang Sheng ignored the Demon King. His face took on an expression that looked something like a smile, but it was far too toothy and feral to be pleasant. He said, \u201cOh, Han Sen; you are quite powerful. Even under these conditions, you manage to stay so calm. But you are under the Sky Demon Lock. You are certainly stronger than a mere King, but not even a deified elite could break the Sky Demon Lock.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Ji Yang Sheng turned away, ignoring Han Sen. He directed his attention to Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. \u201cThese two girls can be privileged guests of my family. Please don\u2019t worry. You guys are VIPs. The Demon will never think of bringing harm to the two of you. We will treat you very nicely.\u201d\n\nBefore Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon could answer, Han Sen laughed. \u201cI was wondering why you were doing this to me. It\u2019s because you want the two of them? If you had told me sooner, I would have given them to you. Why go to all this hassle?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up! I thought you were quite the character, but I can\u2019t believe you are so obscene. How could you say something like that just as a desperate attempt to survive?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng shouted at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you the truth. They are very pretty, but they\u2019re actually insatiable monsters. They\u2019d eat your flesh right down to the bones. I\u2019ve suffered so much following them. I will be very happy if you take them away from me. I will build an altar in your honor, and I will praise you every night. I will treat you like a savior,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHuh, whatever you say. You cannot escape this.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng seemed to know what Han Sen was trying to say. It made him laugh coldly.\n\nHan Sen shook his head and sighed. \u201cMr. Ji, you\u2019re being rather cocky, but we\u2019re only in this situation because of someone else\u2019s work. If it wasn\u2019t for that scary guy in armor, you would be unable to defeat me. You have nothing to be cocky about. It should be that guy there who is cocky.\u201d\n\nJi Yang Sheng smiled and said, \u201cHe is my Demon Doll. He only moves when I move. If you cannot beat my Demon Doll, you aren\u2019t qualified to fight me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemon Doll? He isn\u2019t an actual Demon?\u201d Han Sen pretended to be surprised.\n\n\u201cSir, let\u2019s go back to base now.\u201d The Demon King from earlier stopped Han Sen and Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s conversation. He didn\u2019t want the prince to leak details about the Demon Doll.\n\nJi Yang Sheng wasn\u2019t stupid, though; he knew what was going on. He laughed and said, \u201cHan Sen, stop wasting our time. I won\u2019t kill you. If you behave during your time with the Demon, we will treat you well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean? Can you define \u2018behaving\u2019 for me? Do you want to milk me like a cow? Do you want me to eat grass while you squeeze my udders? You want me to make your sons and grandsons fat and full? You want me to die miserably when there\u2019s nothing left to give?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing like that. If you work, you will be rewarded. If you have this kind of power, you should do things to better the lives of others in this world.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Ji Yang Sheng spoke to Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon. \u201cLadies, please. You both will be my VIPs forever. No matter where you go, no one will dare hurt you. But if you both don\u2019t want to be my friends, I can\u2019t promise you this.\u201d\n\nElysian Moon was always cold, but now she suddenly laughed. She was so pretty that she looked like a moon palace fairy. But her face looked as untouchable as a marble sculpture. When she laughed, it was like a flower opening amidst the snowfall. It was so beautiful. It was like realizing the world was alive after believing it to be dead.\n\nJi Yang Sheng and the other demons were frozen. They were thinking, \u201cThis woman is unbelievably pretty.\u201d\n\nElysian Moon laughed and said happily, \u201cWe would like to go with you, but I\u2019m afraid someone else might not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho won\u2019t?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng asked.\n\n\u201cHim,\u201d Elysian Moon said, looking at Han Sen.\n\nJi Yang Sheng chuckled darkly. \u201cMr. Han is in danger. Even if he doesn\u2019t want you to come with us, he has no say in the matter. He doesn\u2019t even have a say in what happens to him. He will be coming with us, so we can all go together, too. So what if he doesn\u2019t want to?\u201d\n\nElysian Moon shook her head. \u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t understand him at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I need to understand him?\u201d Ji Yang Shen said cockily.\n\n\u201cIf you understood him, you would know he is a suspicious, cunning, insidious, and cruel person. He doesn\u2019t place trust in anyone aside from himself. He always has a backup plan. Even when he is on the brink of doom, he has an escape route planned and ready to go. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t be hanging around here to chat. I would chop his head off and grind him into pieces. Then I would burn those pieces until there was nothing left but ash,\u201d Elysian Moon said in a serious voice.\n\nJi Yang Sheng was shocked. He looked at Han Sen. The man\u2019s body was still wrapped in the toxic snake-like purple air, and the sight made Ji Yang Sheng relax and smile again. \u201cYou think too much. He is under the thumb of the Sky Demon Lock. Not even a deified elite could escape this. No matter how evil he is, getting out of this trap is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s voice asked.\n\n\u201cWhen\u2026\u201d Before Ji Yang Sheng could speak again, his face grew pale.\n\nThe purple mist still surrounded Han Sen, but his body looked like a rainbow. The Sky Demon Lock was melting within that light."
