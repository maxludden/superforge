    "text": "Yisha had been a very special person to the Rebate, so there was no need to worry about the funeral too much. Narrow Moon performed the services very well, and all Han Sen had to do was cooperate with their rituals.\n\nYisha\u2019s death impacted the Rebate a great deal. It affected them deeply, in a variety of ways.\n\nAs one of the two highest ranked individuals of the Rebate, Yisha\u2019s death made them far weaker. It also altered the distribution of benefits and resources that various important Rebate received.\n\nDue to these changes, the biggest negative ended up impacting Yisha\u2019s student Han Sen.\n\nWhen Han Sen went to Night River King to confirm what of Yisha\u2019s legacy would be left to him, he found himself frowning continually.\n\nNight River King provided Han Sen with a list, and there were very few items on that roster with any actual value. Furthermore, Yisha\u2019s home planet of Planet Blade was taken by the elders.\n\nHan Sen was only allowed to claim Yisha\u2019s personal items and belongings. Having expected this treatment, though, Han Sen was prepared to accept the verdict in silence. Now that Yisha was gone, Han Sen was back to being a proper outsider, and the Rebate wouldn\u2019t be willing to give anything of theirs to someone like him.\n\n\u201cKnife was the Cold Palace guardian, but you replaced her. And now that she is dead, it is down to us to select a new guardian for Cold Palace. A real one. Thanks for your help in the meantime, but you can now give us back the tablet. And this is the list featuring all her legacy items you may claim. You will need to sign it,\u201d Night River King said coldly, peering right at Han Sen.\n\nNight River King wanted the Cold Palace guardian\u2019s position. This time, things were going more his way. He would indeed become the guardian in Han Sen\u2019s stead.\n\nHan Sen met Night River King\u2019s eyes and held out the guardian tablet.\n\nNight River King stared at the guardian tablet as it was passed toward him, and his eyes sparkled. The geno art he practiced was aligned quite well with the boons that the deified toad could impart. He\u2019d be able to use the ice and moon powers of the deified toad to become half-deified in only a few centuries.\n\n\u201cI can give you the tablet, and I will sign the form as you asked, but I have one request to make.\u201d Han Sen did not pass the tablet to Night River King just yet. As he spoke, he held it tightly.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision from the Full Moon Office. You aren\u2019t out shopping, kid. You can\u2019t haggle with me for a better deal,\u201d Night River King said emotionlessly.\n\nHan Sen ignored Night River King\u2019s jab, and while fiddling with the tablet, he said, \u201cPlanet Blade is where my master used to live. I hope I will be able to visit Planet Blade during the times that I miss her. I would like permission to access Planet Blade whenever I fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot permit this. Planet Blade belongs to the elders, and this is known to the public of Narrow Moon. People cannot just go there willy-nilly. Not even I can go there without proper permission,\u201d Night River King said seriously.\n\nNight River King certainly could have provided Han Sen access to the planet, but he didn\u2019t want to help Han Sen in any way.\n\nHan Sen did not speak. He merely continued to play with the tablet. He didn\u2019t sign the paper, either. All he did was smile at Night River King.\n\nNight River King frowned and retreated into thought for a moment. \u201cOkay, fine. I will help. I will go and talk to the elders on your behalf, and I will see if I can get you permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to talk. I need you to add that permission onto this list.\u201d Han Sen stared at Night River King icily as he spoke.\n\n\u201cThat is impossible. Don\u2019t push me too far now,\u201d Night River King growled.\n\n\u201cWithout that permission added to this list, you can find someone else to sign it. But you won\u2019t see my name on it,\u201d Han Sen said simply.\n\nNight River King looked gloomy, but he didn\u2019t look mad just yet. He turned to Han Sen and said, \u201cYou can only enter Planet Blade. You cannot touch anything there, then.\u201d\n\nNight River King didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble for himself. After all, he and the elders had already taken many things that, by all rights, should have now belonged to Han Sen. If Han Sen didn\u2019t sign the agreement, that unfairness would get way too much exposure.\n\n\u201cI only miss her. I do not want to take anything from there,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nNight River King amended the list for Han Sen without saying a word. He provided Han Sen with permission to access Planet Blade freely. When he was finished, Han Sen signed it. He confirmed his acceptance of the measly legacy, and then he passed the tablet to Night River King.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t look at the list. Night River King would only have given him whatever the Rebate were willing to part with. They had taken everything they wanted, and they had left what they didn\u2019t. There was no point in looking at the stuff.\n\nSeeing Han Sen packing up Yisha\u2019s things, Night River King laughed inside and thought to himself, \u201cWhat is the point to get permission to go to Planet Blade? You will never receive any more resources from the Rebate.\u201d\n\nHan Sen took Yisha\u2019s legacy items back to Planet Eclipse with him. He had gained many treasures, but not a single one of them was King class. The highest were two Duke treasures that weren\u2019t even useful to him.\n\nThe other things were worth nothing, and they would not benefit him in the least, either.\n\n\u201cIs that all she possessed as a half-deified being?\u201d Han Sen laughed darkly. He thought the whole of Narrow Moon must have looted Yisha\u2019s warehouse already. They had only left him with the meaningless scrap.\n\nEven so, there was nothing Han Sen could do about it. The only person that could back him up was gone, so there was no way he\u2019d ever get his hands on those things.\n\nYisha seemed to have known that, though. And that was why she told Han Sen to let go.\n\n\u201cI will let go, only if I should. But I will not let go of anything that belongs to me by right.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nHan Sen put the items in storage in his warehouse on Planet Eclipse. He took out the few useful items, some of which were things Yisha always made use of.\n\nYisha\u2019s death had crushed the Rebate, but people like Night River King had benefitted a great deal from her passing. They were probably happy about what had happened.\n\n\u201cBrother-in-law, are we staying here in Narrow Moon?\u201d Ji Qing asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOf course we are. Planet Eclipse has a fair amount of resources, and if we were to leave, we\u2019d be allowing others to benefit.\u201d Han Sen smiled\n\n\u201cBut Night River King and the others keep trying to undermine you. The coming days on Planet Eclipse won\u2019t go well for you,\u201d Ji Qing said.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say who will have a difficult time and who will not,\u201d Han Sen murmured, squinting his eyes in thought.\n\nHan Sen did not plan on leaving Narrow Moon. He didn\u2019t like the idea of being kicked out; he\u2019d leave on his own terms.\n\nThe fifteenth day of the month rolled around, and Night River King went to Cold Palace for the first time since accepting the position of Cold Palace guardian. He merrily trekked up to the stone house and settled himself on the porch as the Cold Palace guardian.\n\n\u201cWith this Cold Palace guardian position, I might become half-deified in a mere two centuries. I will be able to replace Knife in Narrow Moon.\u201d Night River King grinned at the thought. He held the Cold Palace guardian tablet so tightly that his hands began to shake. He had waited for this opportunity for so long.\n\nTime passed, and midnight came. Night River King looked at the stone door, waiting for the deified toad to emerge.\n\nSuddenly, Night River King saw a shadow walking across the mountain. He was shocked. Planet Blade was taken, so no one should have been wandering around. And on top of that, it was a restricted area."
