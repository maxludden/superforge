    "text": "There were many things that couldn\u2019t be truly understood by merely reading a book; instead, they had to be figured out by each individual. The teachings of the Xuan Men were this sort of knowledge.\n\nHan Sen planned to find a few people that could research the Xuan Men information on his behalf and determine what content might be suitable for humans to learn. He also wanted to establish a special school in the Alliance that would teach the Xuan Men techniques to other humans. He wanted to pass on the knowledge and expand the lineage of the Xuan Men.\n\nIt was just as Mister White had said: if one or two people in every ten million were able to follow the righteous path of Xuan Men, then that would be enough.\n\nSurprisingly, Ji Yanran expressed an interest in the subject. Han Sen quickly turned the project over to her.\n\nBut Ji Yanran didn\u2019t do as Han Sen hoped. Instead of building a school for the purpose of teaching the Xuan Men philosophy, she opened up a Martial Hall. In it, she would start by teaching the Xuan Men martial arts, whereas the philosophies of the Xuan Men way would be taught at a later time.\n\n\u201cNo one will treasure something that is earned very easily. And the Xuan Men way of thinking is not suitable for everyone. It requires too much heart. By teaching them this way, the philosophies are likely to be accepted by more people,\u201d Ji Yanran explained.\n\nJi Yanran\u2019s line of thinking made sense to Han Sen. He had only learned the secret techniques of the Xuan Men, anyway. He didn\u2019t actually understand the core concepts of the Xuan Men way himself. Potential students would have absolutely no experience with the Xuan Men techniques going in, so it would likely be a waste of time for them to learn. Not many people would ever be able to understand this stuff.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t even start a school, do you really think your Martial Hall will work?\u201d Han Sen asked, purely to be contrary.\n\nJi Yanran laughed. \u201cThis will be easy. We only need your big face for an advertisement, and our doors will be swarmed with upper-class socialites begging to sign up. They only need to hear that these techniques were practiced by the great Han Sen. I wager they\u2019d fight to the death and use any trick in the book to get their kids accepted into our Martial Hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister White\u2019s intention was to see the Xuan Men expanded. If you approach things like this, you are only serving the needs of the upper-class.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nJi Yanran laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Over the years, most ideas start with high society. Once an idea has been accepted by the wealthy and powerful, it is more easily disseminated to the lower class. This is especially true when it comes to the ideals of the Xuan Men. In ancient times, famous philosophers and scholars would embark on lengthy journeys to convince people of all different societal levels of their ideals. Now, we just need time and advertisements.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney, don\u2019t work yourself to the bone. You should bring on some added help.\u201d Han Sen could not be bothered to help her himself, of course. If she was willing to shoulder the responsibility, then that was fine with him.\n\nThe box Han Sen had taken from Holy Town was locked, so he couldn\u2019t open it. He had tried to pry it open in many different ways, but nothing worked.\n\nEven Yisha\u2019s power had been insufficient to break the jade stone box. Because Han Sen hadn\u2019t been able to find out what was inside, he put the box away for the moment.\n\nInstead, he turned his attention to the bone needle. It was the one Han Sen took from the palace maze. There were twelve drops of deified blood still inside it. They represented twelve different deified blood pulses.\n\nHan Sen did not use them. First, he wanted to research them.\n\nBecause Han Sen\u2019s body still contained more Ghost Bone power than he could use, he currently had no need for the energy that the deified blood pulses offered.\n\nHe pondered the blood pulses for a while, and he eventually decided to have a drop anyway.\n\nHan Sen chose to consume the drop he had retrieved from the Blood Demon. It was of the blood element. He wanted to see if it might help his Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nHan Sen lifted the bone needle above his chest. And then, he thrust it into his heart.\n\n(This was not an intravenous injection like one would receive from an ordinary doctor. If a normal person tried this as Han Sen did, they would most definitely die. Do not try this at home.)\n\nThe bone needle pierced right through his heart, and a drop of deified blood spilled into him.\n\nHan Sen was about to begin refining the deified blood when he suddenly heard an announcement play in his head.\n\n\u201cSuccessful infusion of deified gene. Deified gene +1. Deified progress is 1/100.\u201d\n\nAfter that announcement, Han Sen felt a scary power explode in his heart and sweep into every corner of his body. His cells shuddered as the new power surged through him, and he began to change.\n\nHis body felt like he was shedding, sloughing off layer upon layer of old cells. This entire process lasted a whole day before coming to an end. Trails of a black substance littered the floor, like the flaky remains of a dead snake. It looked quite scary.\n\nHan Sen: super god spirit body\n\nGene Battle Body: Mutant Blood (Duke), Spell (Marquise), Dongxuan (Marquise), Jadeskin (Duke)\n\nLevel: Duke\n\nDuke Genes: 17\n\nDeified Progress: 1/100\n\nLifespan: 1100\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He did not know what \u201cdeified progress\u201d meant.\n\n\u201cAre deified genes different from the genes that come before? What does \u2018deified progress\u2019 mean? Does this mean I will be deified once the number reaches a hundred? I can achieve deified status without maxing out any other genes?\u201d Han Sen could not figure out what was going on.\n\nHan Sen studied himself after receiving his one deified gene. His body had changed. It was like his genes had all improved. What hadn\u2019t improved, though, was his fitness. It was still at the level of a Duke.\n\nHan Sen tried to refine another deified drop of blood. The process was exactly the same. Han Sen\u2019s body changed again, and he received an additional deified gene point. His deified progress became 2/100. His fitness did not increase much.\n\nBut if he was able to earn deified genes, that meant it was a power that humans could accept. That relaxed many of Han Sen\u2019s worries, and he absorbed the rest of the deified blood.\n\nOver the next two weeks, Han Sen refined his deified blood. His deified progress became 12/100, and after the refining process, his fitness increased by quite a bit.\n\nBut strangely, Han Sen didn\u2019t gain any special blood pulse powers after receiving the deified blood pulses.\n\n\u201cWhere can I get more deified genes? Once I reach one hundred, I guess I\u2019ll be able to find out what it does,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. It would be too difficult to kill deified beings by himself, though. At his current strength, it was an impossible task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the little red bird ate my Sun Raven. If it hadn\u2019t, I could have given it a try. Perhaps I could eat the flesh of deified creatures,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nThinking about the little red bird, Han Sen checked on the egg inside the bird\u2019s nest again. Han Sen was shocked. A number of weird substance chains had appeared from the nest and were drilling into the red egg. The red color of the egg was shining brightly, as if it was being consumed by a red fire."
