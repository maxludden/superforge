The spirits called upon Undead Emperor to help slay Han Sen due to his undying body, but just like always, the results shocked them.\n\nThe previously-thought-to-be-indestructible body of Undead Emperor was utterly annihilated by Han Sen\u2019s slap.\n\nMankind had won that round, as well. And after Han Sen claimed the mountain, humanity began to celebrate another job well done. But all of a sudden, a light shone in the sky high above.\n\nThe ground began to shake, quake, and rumble. Tears formed across the region, through subterranean explosions. It was like a coming apocalypse, and it frightened the onlookers.\n\nAside from where Han Sen was, the land was churned into utter ruin and carnage. The mountains around collapsed into themselves, sinking down into black pits. Eventually, only Sky Mountain remained, surrounded by abyssal depths.\n\nThe humans that saw this felt a great chill. Where the encompassing regions went, they had no clue, but the only relief they could feel was the belief they had been spared somehow.\n\n\u201cThere are words written across the black reaches that surround us!\u201d a person called out.\n\nWhen the people turned to take a look, they read it out. It said, \u201cWe fight in three days. Yours sincerely, The King.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at the chasm with worry. It was a sinister way to send a message, and even though they had full confidence in Han Sen, they couldn\u2019t help but feel afraid.\n\nHan Sen was their only lifeline. If he was defeated, things would go back to how they once were, as nobody else could carry his flame.\n\nThe news that The King had challenged Han Sen was all over the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. While this greatly excited the spirits, humans were less enthusiastic about the concept.\n\nIf a human like Han Sen was defeated, progress in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary would revert back to zero. Mankind would lose their entire grip on what they had obtained there thus far, and would most likely be treated even worse.\n\nAnd with the spectacle that accompanied the invitation, of entire lands being sunken, the fear of Han Sen losing grew. They started to believe Han Sen did not have what it took to defeat The King.\n\nThe three days passed by quickly, and all that while, humans worried. But now, the day for that fateful fight had come.\n\nOn the day of battle, Han Sen ventured to the peak of Sky Mountain and stood proudly. He waited there for The King to show. Although humans were tinged with a bit more worry than the spirits, they were all excited to see and hear what the result would be.\n\nEventually, a body that looked like The King arrived. And after that, the area turned black. Nobody could see or hear a thing. A second later, everything returned to how it was.\n\nWhen they looked up again, they were all shocked at what they saw. Han Sen and The King were gone; neither of them could be seen, and the mountaintop had vanished as well.\n\nThe trail of a battle was found, though, one that extended all the way to the Endless Sea. Although no one had seen the battle unfold, the markings of what had occurred looked bad. It must have been a brutal tussle.\n\nWhen the wake of combat reached the Endless Sea, none dared traverse the place. The gravity issue was bad enough, but the tsunamis that raged were frightening.\n\nSeven days later, the rage of the Endless Sea was quelled.\n\nAlthough nothing of the fight could actually be seen, it was hailed as the most epic and legendary fight every performed by a human. The Alliance decided to call it the \u201cFinal Fight.\u201d\n\nBut no one yet knew who won the battle. The Alliance said Han Sen had won, but the spirits said The King had won.\n\nThe battle had stopped, and Han Sen and The King established a contract.\n\nThere were three core pillars of the contract.\n\nIt stated that humans who were sent to spirit shelters were allowed to return to the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen would also provide spirits near-absolute freedom, as long as they did not venture past Sky Mountain and left those lands alone.\n\nTo the east of Sky Mountain was land solely belonging to mankind. Spirits were not allowed to go there.\n\nA lot of factions agreed with the contents of the contract, and it seemed like the best of both worlds. At the very least, it meant every surpasser had been freed.\n\nHan Sen had also secured a million miles square of land for humans to occupy and live freely in.\n\nThe Alliance was worried that if Han Sen died or had to leave the sanctuary, they would lose everything he had secured. As a result, they greatly agreed with the terms of the contract.\n\nThe King became a hero to the spirits of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. When Undead Emperor was killed, all hope was lost. And yet, The King did not shy away from the battle. He went up and battled Han Sen alone. And hearing humans were no longer allowed to go past Sky Mountain, they were delighted.\n\nSome people believed The King might have actually been the elusive Dollar, but few agreed with that theory. Spirits did not believe The King was a human, and humans did not believe Dollar was a spirit.\n\nHan Sen knew the contract had no power, though. When he ascended to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, it would be rendered nullified. He only hoped the terms could be respected, going forward.\n\nSo, Han Sen used this opportunity to bring Ji Yanran and his mother to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHis mother was sent to a place in the human lands, whereas Ji Yanran was sent to a shelter that belonged to the dominion of spirits. But because of the terms of the contract, Ji Yanran was allowed to return to the Alliance and let Han Sen know where she was. Then, Han Sen was able to go there and bring her to where it was safe.\n\nHan Sen gave the pair a bunch of Life Geno Essences to give them a headstart.\n\nHan Sen did not aid the other humans much, though. He wanted them to become strong by themselves, for that would be true strength they\u2019d be earning.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s subordinates became guards for shelters, but they wouldn\u2019t join any battles.\n\nHan Sen brought a few of the people he knew back to the underground shelter, too, unbeknownst to some.\n\nHan Sen let his mother handle many things there, while he took the time to focus on what was necessary for him, if he wished to reach the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHan Sen also wondered over what Dragon King had told him, about the special gene lock that might or might not exist. He had opened the tenth gene lock on three of his abilities, but he didn\u2019t feel anything remotely close to what Dragon King had described to him.\n\nHan Sen wished to figure it out before ascending, which aligned with the Alliance\u2019s desire of wanting him to remain for a while, too.\n\nWhen Han Sen returned home, he received a letter. Much to his surprise, it had been written with an actual pen.\n\nHan Sen opened the envelope, and soon after, he began to tremble."
