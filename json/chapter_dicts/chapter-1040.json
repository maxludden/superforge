    "text": "Han Sen wanted to approach the doors and examine them, but Brother Seven stopped him and said, \u201cThis place is dangerous. Don\u2019t do anything reckless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that where the Phoenix Eye might reside?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBrother Seven turned to look at the images of a phoenix and said, \u201cA phoenix is a bird that has died, and is then reborn from the ashes of its prior form. Typically, dead is dead, and you don\u2019t get to come back from that. But there have been rare instances of resurrection in the past.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven noticed that the claws of each phoenix were painted around the door knockers. Each door had a knocker.\n\nWhen Brother Seven saw this, he said, \u201cOn my signal, we knock on the door three times.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and moved over to the left door\u2019s knocker.\n\nThe door was massive. It would have been impossible for one person to use both door knockers at the same time, so the duo had to co-operate.\n\nBrother Seven reminded Han Sen to knock three times, and three times only. He looked nervous.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t really sure what was going on, so he wasn\u2019t feeling any sort of pressure.\n\nBrother Seven gave his command, and then they used the door knockers three times.\n\nTheir knocking was perfectly in sync with each other.\n\n\u201cBack!\u201d Brother Seven shouted, which prompted them both to retreat away from the door a little. Then, they watched what might happen.\n\nBao\u2019er was still there, suckling her milk bottle. She watched with as much curiosity as they did.\n\nThe screeching of two phoenix birds sounded. The images came to life, and they left the door to fly around together.\n\nHan Sen had maxed out his fire geno points, but even so, the heat the phoenixes were emitting was incredibly hot even for him.\n\nThe doors slowly opened to reveal a large hall. They could see two lanterns there, still lit after all those years.\n\nBrother Seven stepped inside and said, \u201cQuick; when the phoenixes return to the doors, they will close.\u201d\n\nHan Sen walked past both creatures, feeling as if his hair was being singed.\n\nJust as they both entered the hall, the phoenixes returned to their doors, and the doors silently closed.\n\nThe hall before them had nine lanterns, each shaped like the head of a phoenix.\n\nBut aside from that, there was nothing else of particular interest. There was, however, another room they could enter at the back. No light came from within, so it was pitch-black.\n\nBrother Seven muttered to himself, \u201cTwo phoenixes together, and the lanterns split them up. I didn\u2019t know spirits practiced Yin Yang.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Seven, care to speak up? What does that mean?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen was a proficient fighter, but that was about it. He wasn\u2019t really educated in the subjects that Brother Seven was.\n\nBrother Seven then said, \u201cPhoenix Emperor is not a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a spirit,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\nBrother Seven then said, \u201cI mean, he is not a sole person. There are two.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying there are two of these emperors?\u201d Han Sen asked with much shock.\n\nBrother Seven responded with a nod. \u201cThere is a male and a female phoenix. \u2018Phoenix Emperor\u2019 is a title given to a pair of spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe they are together, in a two-for-one way?\u201d Han Sen suggested.\n\nBrother Seven agreed and said, \u201cIt is possible, but they would still wield two separate powers.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven looked at a lantern to his left and said, \u201cThis is the fire. It represents Yang.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven then looked to the right lantern and said, \u201cThis is the blackfire. It represents Yin.\u201d\n\nHan Sen noticed the fires did indeed look different.\n\n\u201cDo they mean different things?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBrother Seven explained, \u201cThe living fire is Yang. It guides you to life, survival, and prosperity. The blackfire is Yin, which guides you to hell.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven looked towards the black hallway ahead and said, \u201cThat is a path that straddles the line between Yin and Yang. I am not sure what danger, if any, will await us. If we seek to survive, we are going to need a lantern. But\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThe phoenix lanterns are for the living. We have to bring them, if we want to survive. But even so, that doesn\u2019t seem quite right.\u201d Brother Seven paused for a brief moment of contemplation, and then went on to say, \u201cThis is a path between life and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen which lantern are we to pick?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Whichever we choose, there is great risk. This is a test of this Phoenix Emperor; and he is smart, whoever he is.\u201d Brother Seven had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cWell, if we aren\u2019t going to get any answers there\u2019s no use debating is there? Let\u2019s give it a go.\u201d Han Sen picked up a lantern without consultation, and went on to say, \u201cI\u2019ll go first and check it out.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know anything about the matters Brother Seven was talking about, so he was not very concerned with the need to be careful. If Phoenix Emperor was ahead, and he had to fight him, Han Sen was confident he could just use super king spirit mode to defeat him.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Brother Seven said, as he stopped Han Sen. \u201cThink of a word in your mind. It can be any word. And now tell me what it is. I can predict, from your word, whether your selection of lantern is good or bad.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cPrediction is pointless. We can\u2019t change our destiny; a decision is a decision. Being able to predict things is a waste of time. I\u2019m going; good lantern or bad.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen lifted his lantern and walked forward into the dark place."
