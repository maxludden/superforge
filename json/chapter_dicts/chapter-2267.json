    "text": "Han Sen jumped onto the blood kirin\u2019s back. Then, the blood kirin roared and flew towards Ice Blue Knight King and the others.\n\n\u201cIgnore those other guys and kill him first,\u201d Han Sen instructed, thrusting his Thunder God Spike toward Ice Blue Knight King.\n\nInstead of answering, the blood kirin simply kept roaring as it headed for Han Sen\u2019s target.\n\n\u201cCharge!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King called to the Ice Blue Knights as he swept his greatsword at the blood kirin.\n\nThe blood kirin paid no mind to the other Knights, though. The Knights had previously exploited the blood kirin\u2019s stupidity to land a few blows, but now that the creature was following Han Sen\u2019s commands, they found themselves having to give the creature an even wider berth.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, if you keep this up, you will never be allowed back into the Ice Blue Knights!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King shouted, watching an Ice Blue Knight get torn to shreds by the blood kirin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already quit the Ice Blue Knights. Do you really think I plan to return after all this? When you guys decided to fight with me, you should have said your prayers and readied yourselves for death!\u201d Han Sen shot back.\n\nIce Blue Knight King did not speak again. He had treated Han Sen as Yisha\u2019s student. He thought of Han Sen as a junior, and he had never thought he would have to take the young man as an enemy.\n\nEven though Han Sen had betrayed the Knights, Ice Blue Knight King only wanted to teach him a lesson as a senior Knight. He wanted to grab Han Sen, take the slate, then haul Han Sen back to his rightful place in the Knights.\n\nIt was only now that Ice Blue Knight King realized he had been wrong about Han Sen since the beginning. He never considered Han Sen as an equal, and it never crossed his mind that Han Sen would see him as an opponent. Or a competitor.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t a junior who required protection or could be ordered around. Han Sen was a mighty elite who had exactly what it took to survive and thrive in that cruel world. He was holding his own despite the many powerful enemies that wanted him dead.\n\nIce Blue Knight King\u2019s realization might have come too late. If he had considered Han Sen as a real threat in the beginning, he wouldn\u2019t have given Han Sen any chance to escape the base. He would have taken Han Sen down as soon as possible, and he wouldn\u2019t have chased after Han Sen alone when he first made his escape.\n\nThe blood kirin chased the group back to the hellish skeletal gate, killing everyone but Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, and one other Ice Blue Knight along the way.\n\nHan Sen and the blood kirin didn\u2019t dare draw too close to the gate, though. Han Sen allowed the three survivors to escape. Then, he went back to the lotus mountain where the blood kirin lived.\n\n\u201cI was foolish. I should have treated him like a genuine opponent.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King stared at Han Sen, who was riding away atop the blood kirin. His face was expressionless, showing no hint of anger or sadness.\n\nFrom that moment on, Ice Blue Knight King was going to treat Han Sen like a genuine opponent. To go against a strong opponent, though, he\u2019d need more than the few students he had.\n\nCrime looked grim. \u201cIs that guy really Yisha\u2019s student? He seems scarier than Yisha. I fear we may have underestimated him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot blame us for that. Who would have assumed that a Marquise could pose such a threat?\u201d asked the other Ice Blue Knight, whose name was Harder.\n\nHarder was feeling rather conflicted at that moment. He and Edward had been very close, so he knew just how terrifying the man had been.\n\nAlthough Edward was just a hybrid Extreme King and his attack power wasn\u2019t too strong when compared to the rest, his powers of observation and his movements were splendid.\n\nHarder again envisioned Edward lying helpless under Han Sen\u2019s attack, and the Ice Blue Knight struggled to find words to describe what that horrible sight had done to him.\n\nAlthough Han Sen was just a Duke, no one dared treat him as a Duke anymore.\n\nFox Queen met Ice Blue Knight King and the other two at the gate. She frowned and said, \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King told her what had happened. He spoke plainly and without exaggeration, describing Han Sen and the blood kirin\u2019s power. And he did not hide the fact that his group had well and truly failed.\n\n\u201cInteresting. Very interesting. The blood kirin became half-deified that quickly? And Han Sen was riding it in battle?\u201d Fox Queen squinted her eyes.\n\nShe didn\u2019t blame Ice Blue Knight King. After a moment, she said, \u201cYou guys can stay here to aid Mister White in breaking the restrictions of this place. When I break the chains binding me here, I can go and take him down myself.\u201d\n\nBack in the blood kirin\u2019s valley, Han Sen allowed Bao\u2019er and the others to leave Destiny\u2019s Tower and relax for a bit. He also wanted to discuss their game plan for the coming conflict.\n\nHan Sen had used the blood kirin\u2019s power to defeat Ice Blue Knight King and the others for the time being, but he didn\u2019t think they were safe yet. And that made him even more worried.\n\nEdward and the others had been able to find the palace and bend the restrictions to gain entry. That meant one of them understood the structure of the palace, at least to some degree.\n\nFox Queen hadn\u2019t sent Mister White after them, and that was probably because Mister White knew the most about the palace\u2019s composition. If he was able to break Fox Queen\u2019s restrictions, then Han Sen would be in big trouble.\n\nHan Sen stood no chance of defeating an unhampered deified elite, even if he had all sorts of deified items to use against her. And now, Han Sen was stuck in the White Bone Hell. The palace was his only means of escape. Unless he wanted to stay there forever, he would have to leave through the skeletal gate.\n\n\u201cBut the blood kirin is only half-deified. If I could make it deified, it would be easy to ride it out and slaughter whatever got in our way,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s team talked for half the day, but they didn\u2019t come up with anything that seemed really promising. Han Sen decided to focus his efforts on absorbing all the Ghost Bone power he could. He hoped to get The Story of Genes to Duke class. The more power he had, the better his chances of survival would become.\n\n\u201cEven if Fox Queen really does manage to escape, she won\u2019t kill me if she can\u2019t find what she wants. That means I might still have a chance.\u201d As Han Sen rested, he fidgeted with the stone plate. He kept thinking about how things might play out.\n\nThe blood kirin and Han Sen were very comfortable with each other by this point, but only Han Sen could get close to the beast. The creature\u2019s presence was too menacing. It looked at everyone else like slabs of meat. The blood kirin looked likely to jump forward and gobble them up at any second.\n\nHan Sen kept practicing with The Story of Genes. A month went by, and The Story of Genes was progressing quite well. It was still a long way away from becoming Duke, though.\n\nSuddenly, the whole of White Bone Hell began to shake, and Han Sen heard Fox Queen\u2019s voice coming through the hellish skeletal gate. \u201cMy good little brother! Your big sister is coming to find you.\u201d\n\nFox Queen stood in front of the gate, and the metal shackles were still visible on her neck, arms, and ankles. The metal chains that connected to the shackles, however, were gone.\n\nMister White, Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, and Harder stood behind Fox Queen. It was like they were now her people.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s aura spread across the White Bone Hell, searching for Han Sen. But suddenly, two shadows appeared from the mountains. It was Han Sen and the blood kirin. That surprised her. She had expected Han Sen to try to escape, not come looking for her."
