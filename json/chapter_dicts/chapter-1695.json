    "text": "Since the teleporter he\u2019d come out of was entirely random, there were too many possibilities. He could come out of a public teleporter, or even a private one.\n\nHan Sen donned his Death Armor Swordsman appearance before stepping inside, in case someone saw him come through and questioned how he had been able to do that. This was something not even he could explain.\n\nThe elites knew he had ascended and gone back to the Alliance, but there was no knowing if they knew Han Sen was able to travel to and from the sanctuaries. It wouldn\u2019t be just God\u2019s Organization poking about these matters, if it became publicly known; the Alliance government would undoubtedly want answers, too.\n\nHan Sen was not afraid, but he just didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be worth all the trouble.\n\n\u201cDear God, please let me spawn close to home. It would be best if I end up straight on Planet Roca.\u201d As Han Sen prayed, the teleporter\u2019s lights started to blur, sending him to his destination.\n\nThe dimensions around looked odd, and when Han Sen\u2019s vision returned, he was standing in a teleporter belonging to the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen opened the chamber and took a look around. He was not standing outside a public teleporter, and he soon realized he was standing inside the music hall of someone\u2019s home.\n\nThe architecture was fairly old-fashioned, but with the decorations and space available, you could tell it was a music hall belonging to a very rich family. Romantic music was playing, and it made Han Sen calm down somewhat.\n\nIf this place belonged to rich people, he wouldn\u2019t be on a planet that was too far away. At the very least, it meant he could get home.\n\nJust as he was about to use Dongxuan Aura to learn more about his environment, someone entered the hall.\n\nIt was a beautiful woman with curly, wet hair. She had a white towel wrapped tight around her body, revealing her gorgeous long legs. Her skin was snow-white.\n\nHer eyes were closed as she came in, with a glass of wine in one hand. She danced to the music frivolously, believing no one to be watching. She sipped her wine, immersing herself in the rhythm of the music. She looked happy.\n\nThe woman was in her private home, and she never thought someone else might be there. She felt entirely secure.\n\nHer mood was bright, as she kept her eyes closed while sipping wine and spinning to the rhythms of the music.\n\nIt happened unexpectedly. After a few mesmerizing spins, the towel dropped from her body. And what\u2019s more, she was only half a meter away from Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen looked at her, and although he was delighted to allow his eyes to feast on such a wonderful body, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little awkward about it all.\n\nTo add to that, he knew who this woman was. He was quite close with her. It was Huangfu Pingqing from the Huangfu family. She was his senior, and he never expected their next encounter would play out like this.\n\nBecause the towel had fallen, she opened her eyes in order to pick it back up.\n\nShe opened her eyes and saw Han Sen. They looked at each and froze for three seconds.\n\nHuangfu Qingping screamed. The next second, she summoned a beast soul armor and tried to kick Han Sen in the balls.\n\nHan Sen was now very happy he had used his shapeshifting beast soul. She could not tell who he was in his current state. Things would have been very bad if she could recognize him, and so he swiftly dodged, broke the window, jumped out, and ran off.\n\nWhen he flew into the sky, he soared through the atmosphere.\n\n\u201c*sshole! I won\u2019t let you go,\u201d Huangfu Qingping nibbled her lips as she started to pursue. Fortunately, Han Sen was too fast for her, and she couldn\u2019t keep up for very long.\n\n\u201cDefense System: Intruder Detected. Attack Confirmation?\u201d The Al standing next to her spoke.\n\n\u201cAttack,\u201d Huangfu Qingping said immediately.\n\n\u201cAttack,\u201d the computer repeated. Then, the weapon systems took aim at Han Sen who was flying away.\n\nBoom!\n\nA net of lights all came screaming through the air toward Han Sen.\n\nThat was the Huangfu family\u2019s planet, and its defensive systems were strong. They could easily protect the planet from attacks instigated by entire battleship fleets. It was very powerful.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t dare use Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go. Queen was from the Huangfu family, and although Huangfu Qingping never practiced it herself, she would be able to recognize it when she saw it.\n\nThe light was too much, and Han Sen had great difficulty dodging. So, instead, Han Sen used the glove on his hand to block the strikes.\n\nThere were loads of explosions in the air, and the radar systems were disrupted because of them.\n\nSeeing Han Sen get hit by all those explosions, Huangfu Qingping believed him to have been killed. Demi-gods would most certainly be shot down under the intensity of such blasts.\n\nWhen the radar system returned to normal, though, the satellites revealed images of Han Sen now up in space, entirely unharmed. He disappeared quickly from the satellite\u2019s viewing spectrum, though.\n\nHuangfu Qingping was shocked, and when she went to confirm via the space telescope, she confirmed that he really was gone.\n\n\u201cThat was Qingping Senior. Her skin and body are still as good as ever; it\u2019s only her grumpy mood that needs work.\u201d After Han Sen escaped, he privately complimented her as he reviewed what had happened and what he had been able to see.\n\nHan Sen summoned the unicorn beetle, then brought up its map. He wouldn\u2019t say he was either close to Planet Roca or too far from there, but with the unicorn beetle\u2019s speed, he\u2019d arrive home in a day\u2019s travel.\n\nHan Sen flew the beetle towards Planet Roca, where his family was.\n\nHuangfu Qingping was madly looking over the video that had been recorded, trying to learn who that person might have been. There were no cameras in the music hall, but the external cameras didn\u2019t pick up anything about him conning in. They only saw him escape and get to space.\n\nHuangfu Qingping swore to find who that *sshole was. She searched tirelessly for the culprit, despite knowing that he had used a shapeshifting beast soul which hid everything about the person behind it.\n\nShe did find something special, though. His right hand was strange. He may have had armor on, but his right hand was wearing a glove. It looked very weird.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know if it was a beast soul or not, but she could definitely start an investigation from her knowledge of the shapeshifting beast soul and glove the intruder wore.\n\n\u201cHe must be a powerful demi-god to block those attacks. That certainly narrows down the list of possible candidates,\u201d Huangfu Qingping thought angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t let me find out who you are. Otherwise, you\u2019re done for."
