    "text": "Han Sen took a moment to look around, trying to place where he was within the core area. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to hunt core xenogeneics at the moment. After he had confirmed his location, he just returned to camp.\n\nHan Sen walked out of his private room, then suddenly jerked to a stop. Falling Leaf and Bao\u2019er were staring each other down. Falling Leaf\u2019s face, meanwhile, was covered in paper.* She was holding two cards, and she looked very serious.\n\nBao\u2019er, on the other hand, was holding one card. She looked gravely at Falling Leaf\u2019s two cards.\n\n\u201cWhich one should I choose?\u201d Bao\u2019er wondered, carefully considering the decision. She pointed her finger, wavering between the two cards in the other woman\u2019s hand. It looked as if she had to pick one out of the two.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw them, he knew Bao\u2019er and Falling Leaf were playing Old Man.\n\nOld Man was very simple to play. One of the Jokers was removed from a normal deck of playing cards, and then the deck was dealt to the players.\n\nEach player then removed all the pairs they could from their hand. Once their hands only contained the cards that couldn\u2019t be paired, they took turns choosing cards from one another\u2019s hands. If a player chose a card that they could pair with one of their own cards, the player could discard the pair. The winner was whoever got rid of the Joker, which could not be paired, and discarded all of their cards.\n\nThis was a game that Han Sen had played a lot with Bao\u2019er in the past. Because Han Sen was very good at this sort of prediction game, Bao\u2019er initially never won. But after they played for a while, he stopped winning so often. Before long, Han Sen felt as if he would never win another game. It took a lot of focus for him to play with Bao\u2019er, especially when he was doing his best to avoid losing.\n\nEventually, he just stopped playing with Bao\u2019er entirely, which meant Bao\u2019er could never exact revenge on Han Sen for all the times he had beaten her. Bao\u2019er had been angry about that for quite some time.\n\nBut Han Sen was very adamant about not playing with her. He never gave her the chance to exact revenge on him.\n\nIt was a game that was highly based on luck, judgment, observation, and mind tricks. The Han family prided themselves on their skill with the game, but Han Sen was no longer sure if he had what it took to beat Bao\u2019er these days.\n\nSeeing Falling Leaf with a face full of paper, he could tell she had lost badly. Bao\u2019er\u2019s face was very clean, and there was not a single piece of paper on her.\n\nAs Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand moved slowly back and forth between the two cards, Falling Leaf\u2019s face displayed no emotion. But her heart leaped in her chest with every movement of Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand.\n\nShe really did feel awful. In the beginning, she had only agreed to play the game with Bao\u2019er to make the child happy. A game like this was too easy for a killer like her. She was excellent at reading people, and her prediction abilities were phenomenal, of course.\n\nBut in all the time since they had begun playing, she hadn\u2019t won once. Falling Leaf was rapidly growing rather desperate, and she would have done anything to win at least once.\n\nFalling Leaf\u2019s eyes stared at the two cards in her hands. Whenever Bao\u2019er touched the Joker card, she felt good. When she pointed at the seven of hearts, she felt very worried.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll pick this one?\u201d Bao\u2019er said. Her little hand reached for the Joker card. Falling Leaf\u2019s pulse quickened as Bao\u2019er\u2019s fingers brushed the Joker card\u2026\n\n\u201cTake it! Take it!\u201d Falling Leaf was shouting madly in her heart, but she didn\u2019t allow her emotions to show on her face.\n\nSuddenly, Bao\u2019er stopped. She turned and grabbed the seven of hearts, and she smiled. \u201cI think I am going to take this one.\u201d\n\nA muscle in Falling Leaf\u2019s cheek twitched. Her fingers tightened on the two cards as Bao\u2019er tried to pull the seven of hearts loose. Falling Leaf wouldn\u2019t let it go.\n\nSeeing that the woman was refusing to let the card go, Bao\u2019er didn\u2019t know what to do. She let go of the seven of hearts and picked the Joker card. \u201cIn that case, I will take this one.\u201d\n\nFalling Leaf was thrilled, and she released her clawlike grip on the cards. Bao\u2019er grabbed the Joker card and quickly said, \u201cIt is my turn.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er placed two cards in the deck and then brought out two cards of her own. Facing Falling Leaf, she said, \u201cOkay, it is your turn to pick.\u201d\n\nFalling Leaf gritted her teeth and stared at the two cards. She focused intently, as if she could read something from the back of the cards.\n\nAs the top killer in Spring Rain, Falling Leaf\u2019s powers of observation and judgment were the best. She could easily pick up on even the smallest difference.\n\nShe had just taken the Joker card, so it was possible that some instinct deep within her would guide her to victory.\n\nBut God only knew what material was used to create those cards. They were thin as paper, but she couldn\u2019t sense any trace that might identify the cards. She couldn\u2019t tell what was on the cards.\n\nFalling Leaf\u2019s eyes looked ready to pop out of her skull. She couldn\u2019t tell which one was the Joker card.\n\n\u201cAre you going to pick one or not?\u201d Bao\u2019er said with a yawn.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Falling Leaf reached out her hand to pick the card that was on the left. She looked at Bao\u2019er, hoping to see some sort of clue in her eyes.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the one you want, then just take it,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, her face bored.\n\nFalling Leaf, hearing Bao\u2019er say this, decided not to pick it. They had only been together for two hours, but in Falling Leaf\u2019s eyes, Bao\u2019er was no longer a small child.\n\n\u201cTrying to fool me, huh? It\u2019s not that easy.\u201d Falling Leaf raised her hand to take the card on the right.\n\nWhen she turned it around, though, she looked like she had been struck by lightning. It was a Joker card.\n\n\u201cWhy do you not just believe people? You adults are all so complicated. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked sorrowful as she shook her head.\n\nFalling Leaf\u2019s face twitched. She gnashed her teeth and said nothing. She placed the card down behind her and drew two more cards. She put them in front of Bao\u2019er and coldly said, \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pick this one.\u201d Bao\u2019er reached out her hand and picked up the seven of hearts from Falling Leaf\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cHaha, I win again.\u201d Bao\u2019er threw down her pair of sevens. She grabbed a piece of paper and stuck it on Falling Leaf\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing again!\u201d Falling Leaf started to shuffle the deck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing. You are too weak for me.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked very bored.\n\n\u201cJust one last time,\u201d Falling Leaf said slowly, enunciating the words. Her eyes looked ready to burst into flames.\n\nHan Sen almost laughed. Playing that game with Bao\u2019er was like a death wish.\n\nBao\u2019er rolled her eyes, looking like she really had no interest in playing. She said, \u201cWe can play, but sticking paper on each other\u2019s faces is boring. Let us raise the stakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. What would you like to bet?\u201d Falling Leaf really wanted to win. She was Spring Rain\u2019s top killer. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to lose to a kid. She had to win.\n\n\u201cThe loser has to go to the door and shout \u2018I am stupid,'\u201d Bao\u2019er said after a moment of thought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Falling Leaf hesitated. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure she could defeat Bao\u2019er, and many Spring Rain elites were nearby. It would be embarrassing if she was heard.\n\n\u201cNever mind, then. This is lame, anyway.\u201d Bao\u2019er stood up and got ready to go.\n\n\u201cFine! We will do as you say!\u201d Falling Leaf almost shouted as she touched Bao\u2019er\u2019s arm. She was desperate to defeat her.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t watch. The game had ended before it even began. Not even a deified being could beat Bao\u2019er at this game. This was what the Han Sen family was best at.\n\n*Endnote: When a person loses a round, they place a sticker on their face. This makes it obvious at a glance who is winning and who is losing."
