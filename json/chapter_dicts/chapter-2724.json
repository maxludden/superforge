    "text": "The black crystal that had transformed into an Immortal Dragon could follow commands that Han Sen gave it telepathically. And it had a healing power that was deified class.\n\nThis new black crystal wasn\u2019t exactly what Han Sen thought it would be, and it didn\u2019t have the power of his first black crystal. However, the power it had just demonstrated didn\u2019t seem too shabby.\n\nWith this Immortal Dragon, Han Sen could fight carelessly. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting hurt. As long as he didn\u2019t die, the Immortal Dragon could simply heal his body.\n\nThe strangest thing about it was that the Immortal Dragon could be reduced to a black crystal. In many ways, it was like a beast soul. He could lob it into his Sea of Soul for easy storage, which meant he could take it with him wherever he went.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t wait to fight a deified xenogeneic so he could give it a try. The idea of fighting while the Immortal Dragon\u2019s immortal area backed him up was very exciting.\n\nBao\u2019er had grown quite bored as she lounged comfortably on a Star Fruit. She spent some time playing with the gem she had gotten from Empty God, but eventually, she put it away. It didn\u2019t take long for her to lose interest in it.\n\nRight now, Bao\u2019er was missing Empty God. He was the only person who had been kind enough to give her so many toys for free.\n\nAs Han Sen was practicing under the tree, someone teleported to the boundaries of the Star Tree. Han Sen raised his head and realized that person was Shale.\n\n\u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n\n\u201cShale?\u201d Han Sen looked surprised to see him. Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen Shale since the silkworm bout. He didn\u2019t know why Shale would have come all the way to the Star Tree.\n\n\u201cI received the leader\u2019s permission to come here and collect a Star Fruit.\u201d Shale pulled out a notice to show Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI see. Please come in.\u201d Upon confirming that the notice was legit, Han Sen shut down the defenses of the Star Tree to permit Shale to enter.\n\nHan Sen felt very uneasy about this, though. After the Star Tree\u2019s original guardian left, Star Fruit was forbidden to be consumed by anyone. But the Very High leader had still permitted Shale to come and take fruit. That wasn\u2019t normal, for sure.\n\nShale wasn\u2019t shy or hesitant. He walked right into the Star Tree zone. Han Sen commanded his legion of xenogeneics to not harm the man, and Shale made it safely to the Star Tree.\n\nWhen Bao\u2019er saw Shale, she looked curious. That was because when Empty God had shown her the future using the Star Gauge Mirror, she had seen Shale picking Star Fruit. With Shale now arriving, her curiosity had been piqued.\n\nShale walked toward the tree in a straight, determined path. He didn\u2019t stop or wander around. He seemed to have a pre-selected target.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think this was weird, though. If the Very High leader had given him such unusual approval to come and claim a fruit from the Star Tree, then they wouldn\u2019t just leave his reward up to chance. He must have a target already.\n\nHan Sen was curious, so he followed behind Shale. He wanted to see what Star Fruit Shale was going to collect.\n\nA few minutes later, Shale arrived at the Star Fruit of his choosing. Han Sen couldn\u2019t see what was so special about this particular Star Fruit. Shale didn\u2019t immediately pick it, however. He turned to face Han Sen and told him, \u201cBrother Han, we might have a fight on our hands later. I hope you can protect the Star Tree and keep it from being harmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Han Sen nodded. That was his responsibility. But Shale was a primitive deified, and he spoke to Han Sen like he wasn\u2019t confident in his ability to control whatever it was that lurked inside the fruit. That gave Han Sen a bit of a shock.\n\nThe xenogeneics that came out of the Star Fruits were always asleep, and there was a secret skill to make a contract with them before they awoke. If the person who opened the fruit didn\u2019t want to make a contract with the creature inside, they could kill it while it was still asleep.\n\nBut Shale, who was a primitive deified, said there would be a fight. That cast this entire fruit-opening scenario in a more ominous light.\n\nOnce Han Sen had prepared himself, Shale flew to the top of the Star Fruit. He knocked the Star Fruit down from its branch.\n\nThe whole process, thus far, was the same as when Han Sen had picked his own Star Fruits. The fruit itself burned away, revealing the xenogeneic inside.\n\nThe xenogeneic\u2019s body wasn\u2019t very large. Like Shale, it was an ordinary and muscular creature. It was around three meters tall, and it had blonde hair.\n\n\u201cA golden-haired monkey.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. That xenogeneic had short legs and long arms. Its head had three sets of ears. Each one looked like a snail. It looked very strong, but there was also something strange about the creature.\n\nAlthough Han Sen couldn\u2019t see any substance chains, he could tell that it had a scary presence. He knew that this six-eared, golden-haired monkey was deified.\n\nIt was different from the normal xenogeneics of the Star Fruits. When this blonde monkey was revealed, its eyes were already open and shining gold. The gold light in its eyes looked like it could outshine the moon and the sun.\n\nUpon seeing Shale in front of it, the six-eared, golden-haired monkey suddenly screamed. Its gold substance chains exploded like a holy light. That powerful radiance wrapped around its entire body, and the creature shot toward Shale like a golden flame.\n\nShale\u2019s eyes were unwavering, and he generated a gold substance chain. He didn\u2019t fall back. He moved toward the attacking monkey.\n\nTheir fists hit each other, but the golden-haired monkey didn\u2019t move. Shale\u2019s body stumbled back a few dozen meters before coming to a stop. Judging from this display of power, Shale was weaker than the monkey.\n\nWithout a moment of hesitation, the monkey kept moving. It rushed toward Shale with blinding speed. Its body was releasing a scary presence.\n\nBut Shale didn\u2019t seem worried by the creature\u2019s power. He moved with almost casual elegance, and he shook the pursuit of the six-eared monkey. He fought the monkey not by matching its power, but by utilizing his own prodigious skills.\n\nAlthough Shale was very talented, he had been raised poorly. When Han Sen had first fought him, Shale hadn\u2019t known many top-class geno arts. In the time since they had last seen each other, Shale\u2019s fist skills had improved. He also had a few more top-class geno arts. He had gained a lot of strength, and he was obviously a much more capable fighter now than he had been during the silkworm fights.\n\n\u201cHe really did eat a demon fruit and earn a fake eleven armor talent. His improved speed is way too fast.\u201d Han Sen complimented him.\n\nBut after watching this battle for a while, Han Sen\u2019s brow furrowed. The super-powerful Shale was being suppressed by the six-eared monkey.\n\nAs he watched the fight, Han Sen could tell that the six-eared monkey was a primitive deified. Its speed and power were better than Shale\u2019s fake eleven armor talent, however.\n\nPlus, the six-eared monkey\u2019s power was very strange. Shale would occasionally find an opening to land a blow on the monkey with one of his scary geno arts, but after he attacked, the monkey\u2019s shadow was the only thing that would remain. The six-eared monkey\u2019s real body would appear elsewhere. It would then send a dangerous strike back toward Shale.\n\nShale stayed calm and managed to avoid losing his head each time, but the monkey\u2019s attacks left cuts across his body. He was bleeding continually now, and he looked terrible."
