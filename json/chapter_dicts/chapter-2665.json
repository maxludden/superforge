    "text": "Han Sen would protect any deified treasure he found like it was his own child, yet the Very High were handing out seven of them as little more than prize money. He couldn\u2019t think of another race that could match this level of wealth.\n\nThe Extreme King called themselves the number one race, but compared to the Very High, they were nothing but turtles. Their society was measly in comparison.\n\n\u201cIf I can take down Outer Sky\u2026\u201d As soon as Han Sen had this thought, he shook it off. He knew he couldn\u2019t risk entertaining thoughts like that. He could never think such dangerous things during his time there. If Li Keer and Exquisite found out what he was considering for the future, it wouldn\u2019t end very well for him.\n\nHan Sen kept turning the matter over and over in his head. Eventually, he thought, \u201cI really want that Apollo Set. Maybe I can deal with those other silkworms. I can handle those fights, but that Shale\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to bring him down. I can\u2019t use beast souls, and I can\u2019t use my super god spirit body, because they all know me as Han Sen. How can I beat a born-deified, then?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought about this for a long time, but he couldn\u2019t figure out a solution. After all, he didn\u2019t know much about Shale. According to the information he\u2019d been given, there was little known about the man.\n\nWhen Exquisite and Li Keer came back, Han Sen asked them if they had more information on the other eleven silkworms. Exquisite already had it prepared for him. She handed over the documents that she and Li Keer had spent the last few days gathering.\n\n\u201cBy the way, who is this Li Xue Cheng? Did I offend him in some way?\u201d Han Sen asked, pointing to the first folder. He showed them the back and the name of the editor that was written there.\n\n\u201cHe is connected to Liyu Zhen,\u201d Exquisite admitted after a moment of hesitation.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t read Exquisite\u2019s mind, but he was a very observant person. Exquisite was obviously reacting strangely. He knew there was something between the lines here.\n\n\u201cHas Liyu Zhen done something?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nExquisite remained silent and didn\u2019t answer, but Li Keer said, \u201cI think we should let Han Sen know. It will be for the better. He should know so he can be prepared for the fallout, regardless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Han Sen frowned again.\n\nExquisite explained the wagers that the Very High had made with Li Xue Cheng. And then, she said, \u201cActually, this has little to do with you. This is simply a whole bunch of people being scammed by Li Xue Cheng for a host of resources and treasures. I\u2019m afraid they might not let it go easily, though.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled wryly and asked, \u201cDo the Very High like gambling this much?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who study the Very High Sense have no interest in gambling, but the other branch of our crooked tree\u2026 I think Outer Sky is too safe. The Very High on the other side don\u2019t know what it is like to fight for your life in the face of adversity and death. Some things come too easily to them, and as a result, they don\u2019t treasure what they have.\u201d Li Keer shook her head and sighed.\n\n\u201cIf we make them lose so many resources and treasures, are they going to be mad at me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t come after you, but I can tell you that they won\u2019t be happy with you, either. Li Xue Cheng only wanted to get those resources and treasures, and to do that, he used you,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t get scammed. If I help them win a lot of resources and treasures, wouldn\u2019t they be more inclined to help me out in the future?\u201d Han Sen said with a dark laugh.\n\n\u201cOf course. They control many of Outer Sky\u2019s resources. It can be difficult to avoid interacting with them, and if they like you, things will go so much easier for you.\u201d After that, Li Keer looked at Han Sen with shock. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, isn\u2019t it? To solve all of this neatly, I just have to end up number one in the silkworm fights,\u201d Han Sen growled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, that would fix it, but\u2026 Shale is the unsurmountable challenge you have ahead of you. His talents are scary. There is no doubt about that. In his short four years here, he has learned many geno arts. That includes proficiency with God\u2019s Wander. He can use space teleportation. If you want to fight him, I don\u2019t think anything you can throw at Shale will work,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cIf I haven\u2019t yet tried, how can you so easily think that I can\u2019t beat him?\u201d Han Sen was very calm and composed throughout all this. He quietly opened the new documents and began to study them.\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite looked at each other. They could sense the confidence that had spurred Han Sen to the lofty heights he frequently reached. He now seemed quite confident that he had what it took to defeat Shale. But they couldn\u2019t understand where that unbridled confidence came from.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, don\u2019t you think this is a bit weird? Why can we feel his confidence, but not where the confidence comes from? Unless he is a blindly confident bag of grass, we should be able to feel what is inside him that gives him the confidence he needs to take on this challenge,\u201d Li Keer said to Exquisite after Han Sen left. She didn\u2019t think Han Sen was a bag of grass.\n\n\u201cHis mental control power is so strong. He can control his thoughts. Aside from direct emotions, it is nearly impossible for us to discern what he is thinking,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing to control is your own mind. Even the Very High need the Very High Sense to do it, yet he can do it on his own. Third Sister, your choice in silkworm is exceptional,\u201d Li Keer said with a sigh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where his confidence comes from, but I think he wants to reach first place. If he succeeds, it will be good for you and me,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cI only fear that he is overestimating his capabilities and will die in some tragic way because of it. Then, we will have to go and find a new silkworm.\u201d Li Keer wasn\u2019t very confident about this, and she thought to herself, \u201cIf he was Dollar, I\u2019m sure he would be able to do this.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the things people wanted most were the things that they couldn\u2019t have. Li Keer still missed Dollar.\n\nHan Sen investigated the eleven silkworms, and he started to develop a headache. None of them would be easy to fight. There were many difficult people in the competition in addition to Shale, who topped them all.\n\nOne of the silkworms was actually a Very High. It was very rare to have a Very High as a silkworm. Although all the Very High were very strong, their powers were too similar. And they had all been raised in the same environment. Having a Very High as a silkworm wouldn\u2019t allow the master to learn as much, and so not many of the Very High would agree to take one of their own as a silkworm. Plus, ordinary Very High thought that only low-life creatures deserved to become silkworms. They wouldn\u2019t want to ruin their own reputation by becoming a silkworm, so it was very rare to see this amongst the Very High.\n\n\u201cA Very High half-deified. That will mean he is stronger than Exquisite, right? I don\u2019t think that will be someone easily defeated. And that\u2019s not to mention the bigger trouble further ahead like Shale. Winning these silkworm bouts won\u2019t be easy, at all.\u201d Han Sen dropped the documents for the time being and went back to practicing his geno arts. There were two geno arts he had to learn before fighting Shale. If he didn\u2019t get good at those, he had no chance of winning."
