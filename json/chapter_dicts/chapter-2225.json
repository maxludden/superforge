    "text": "Outside of the Ice Blue system, Night River King was in the middle of slaying a bunch of xenogeneics that were planning to invade. His face turned pale before long, and he was left gasping.\n\nAfter he was forced into the Ice Blue Knights, Night River King had been forced into the frontline ranks to be the first vanguard against any xenogeneic enclaves that wished to invade the system. This engagement, however, had a few too many xenogeneics to deal with. Even Kings like him were left exhausted after the fight, and with how it had been each and every day, he couldn\u2019t stand how things were working out for him.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is an asshole! If I ever get the opportunity to, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d Night River King quietly cursed his nemesis.\n\n\u201cWho is here!\u201d Night River King looked down a hallway due to being alerted.\n\n\u201cYou want to kill Han Sen? I will give you the chance you seek.\u201d A man approached him with a smile.\n\n\u201cMister Inspector, what do you mean?\u201d Night River King, upon seeing Edward, was surprised. It made him produce a large frown.\n\nEdward came before Night River King and said, \u201cHan Sen took something that belongs to me, but Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White is around. As a result, I cannot go and kill him by myself. If you are of the mind to kill Han Sen, too, then we can co-operate. I will give you the exact opportunity you need to kill him.\u201d\n\nNight River King lifted his lips and said, \u201cYou must be joking. These are the Ice Blue Knights. If you have someone you don\u2019t dare kill, why would I take that risk? And on top of that, I am just a conscripted knight.\u201d\n\nEdward smiled and said, \u201cOver the next two days, I will be exploring a new system alongside Mister White and Ice Blue Knight King. I can have you sent to Planet Ice Blue, and if your kill is clean enough, I can ensure no one ever finds out you were in the area. You have to retrieve one item for me, however. After that, I can also have you work by my side. You know, Ice Blue Knight King put you out here on behalf of Han Sen. It was to please him, but you don\u2019t deserve such treatment at all.\u201d\n\nNight River King\u2019s face cycled through a variety of different expressions. He looked at Edward, not sure whether or not he would used and discarded once Edward had gained what he was looking for.\n\nEdward sighed. He looked at Night River King. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it, but you are already in Mister White and Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s bad books. And now you\u2019re rejecting me and my fix? Oh, your fate worries me so much.\u201d\n\nNight River King\u2019s heart kept jumping. The Ice Blue Knights had three key figures. There was Ice Blue Knight King, Edward, and Mister White.\n\nIce Blue Knight King and Mister White stood on Han Sen\u2019s side. If Night River King offended Edward, it would be difficult for him to foresee how he would survive the duration of his service in the Ice Blue Knights. He would be treated as little more as cannon fodder. He\u2019d be expendable.\n\n\u201cMister Inspector, it is not that I don\u2019t want to kill Han Sen. In fact, I would like to skin him alive. The thing is, it\u2019s that I actually cannot kill him. He has a very powerful shield treasure that not even my power can break,\u201d Night River King said while lowering his head.\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard about that. But don\u2019t you worry; I have a little something prepared for you.\u201d Edward, after saying that, gave Night River King something. \u201cTake this with you. I assure you that it will enable you to break Han Sen\u2019s shield treasure. Without his shield, you will surely be able to kill him with ease. But make sure your kill is clean. If it isn\u2019t, then there is no way I can assure your survival.\u201d\n\nNight River King was holding a metal figure that was around the size of a hand. He kept wondering whether or not Edward was seeking to use him and then silence him when all was said and done.\n\nEdward seemed to know what Night River King was thinking, though, so he coldly said, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White keeping an eye on my people, I wouldn\u2019t be asking this of you. But by drawing them away with me, I am giving you the only window of opportunity you are likely to get. You just have to remember to get that item for me. If you don\u2019t, I will kill you.\u201d\n\nNight River King gritted his teeth and bowed. \u201cDo not worry, Inspector. If Han Sen has the item with him, then I will surely bring it back to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe prepared. In a few days, people will come to pick you up. Remember, you will only have one chance at this. Make it swift and clean, and for the love of all, do not leave a trace! If you leave incriminating evidence, no one will be there to back you up.\u201d Edward patted Night River King on the shoulder, and he prepared his defense work.\n\n\u201cMister Edward, why are you asking an outsider to do this for you? What if he takes this item for himself?\u201d The pilot of the vessel asked after Edward returned to his ship.\n\nEdward laughed and answered, \u201cNight River King is smart. He will keep that item for himself as a trump card that will enable him to live. He will probably take it to Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White in the hopes of living.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re still using him?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight asked in obvious confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter. He has no choice.\u201d Edward squinted with his eyes as he spoke. \u201cWith Night River King\u2019s suspicious personality, he will do the kill prettily. Including Han Sen, everyone in his team will die. Even Queen Bai Wei.\u201d\n\n\u201cQueen Bai Wei is in Han Sen\u2019s team?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight\u2019s face changed, and then he immediately understood Edward. \u201cNight River King knows he is going to be killing a queen? He knows going to Ice Blue Knight King won\u2019t work? It will be death for him to admit the crime, so he will have to come running to you? And Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White will suffer because of Queen Bai Wei\u2019s death? They won\u2019t be able to take care of anything.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s team followed the way through Lava Valley. They had cleaned the early regions once already, so their going was quick and unhindered.\n\nBai Wei was following Han Sen, but she remained very quiet. She slowly watched Han Sen and Han Meng\u2019er, eager to learn of their powers.\n\nBut on that trail, there was no opportunity for them to fight, and that disappointed her expectant desires.\n\nSeeing Han Sen continue to move, Bai Wei looked hesitant to speak, but after a while, she had to say, \u201cCaptain, I am leaving the group for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you are in my team. Listen to me: you are not allowed to go off on your own.\u201d Han Sen did not beat around the bush.\n\nIf Bai Wei went off on her own and something bad happened to her, Han Sen and Ice Blue Knight King would be doomed. There was no chance he\u2019d let her wander off alone.\n\n\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you guys come with me?\u201d Bai Wei said coldly.\n\n\u201cI told you; I am the captain. We go where I say we go.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cGo together, or I go alone. The choice is yours to make.\u201d Bai Wei looked indifferent and just as boorish as before.\n\n\u201cWhere are you looking to go?\u201d Seeing Bai Wei was insistent on going someplace, Han Sen at least had to ask her this.\n\n\u201cThe nest of an Undying Bird,\u201d Bai Wei said coldly."
