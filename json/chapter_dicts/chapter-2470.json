    "text": "Han Sen was unable to shake the Dragon\u2019s pursuit, so he stopped running.\n\nLando came to a stop directly in front of Han Sen. Instead of striking, he just looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cYou are the Han Sen that the Extreme King want?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you believe me if I said no?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nLando nodded. \u201cThen come with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could certainly come with you, but could you at least give me a reason that I should follow you?\u201d Han Sen said without moving.\n\nLando laughed. \u201cI\u2019m Lando. That should be reason enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are Lando?\u201d Han Sen was shocked to hear this name.\n\nBecause the factions of the geno universe were so competitive, many people had been bribed by their enemies to betray their race. Some would become proper traitors, whereas others would merely become spies who carried information.\n\nLando was the most famous traitor in the past few decades. When others became traitors, they usually just sold classified information. But Lando had the gall to cut off the head of his master, who was a deified Dragon. He gave it to the ruler of the Destroyed, who used it as a chair.\n\nInverse Dragon Lando\u2019s name was known across the universe. When Dragon-culture was discussed, his name always came up. His actions were a shameful stain on the honor of the Dragons.\n\nThe Dragons had wanted to kill Lando for a long time, but Lando might have been the greatest half-deified to ever exist. And he always worked with extreme caution. The king of the Destroyed protected him, as well. So far, the Dragons hadn\u2019t been able to touch him.\n\nKnowing this story, Han Sen looked at Lando\u2019s back. The man had no draconic wings.\n\nLando was a pure Dragon, but when he killed his teacher, the dying man had managed to tear off his dragon wings. They had never grown back.\n\n\u201cWill you come with me now?\u201d Lando asked in a gravelly voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I believe all the legends about you, but no matter who you are or how strong you are, I have to test your mettle for myself,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cRight. If I was you, I wouldn\u2019t believe the stories about me, either. It\u2019s a shame that the Extreme King want you alive. If they didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through all this trouble,\u201d Lando said. And then, he moved. He tried to grab Han Sen by his head.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t retreat. He sent his full power into Jadeskin. His body became like ice, and he threw his own palm against the hand that Lando had extended.\n\nThe Dragon\u2019s clutching fingers tore through the fabric of space, but Han Sen and Lando\u2019s hands were both bounced backward.\n\nJadeskin\u2019s ice power hadn\u2019t been able to seal Lando. All Dragons had a high resistance to every element, and of course, Lando was no exception to this rule.\n\nThe next second, their fists collided once more. The bodies of the two had become deadly weapons. Their fingers, palms, fists, arms, elbows, legs, and knees moved too fast to track. Neither of them would take a step back.\n\nRather than releasing their power, the fighters exchanged blows of raw physical power. Even that was enough to strain and stretch the fabric of space.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe bones in Han Sen\u2019s fingers were unable to withstand that next scary hit. They broke.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes widened. His Jadeskin made his body very strong, and although it was only at the first tier, his body was as sturdy as a half-deified\u2019s. Lando, however, had been able to break his fingers with a random punch. That was a disturbing amount of power.\n\nLando\u2019s fists kept coming without reprieve. His eyes were perfectly calm as he unleashed his attacks, but his fists flew like a raging fire. Every punch took Han Sen\u2019s full attention.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Jadeskin let out a groaning sound. His arm bones cracked under the next hit, and still, Lando did not relent.\n\nThe Dragon wasn\u2019t attacking Han Sen\u2019s weak spots, though. He was making sure to only strike Han Sen\u2019s arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIs this guy going to break all my limbs to drag me back alive?\u201d Han Sen looked at Lando\u2019s face, and he became certain that he had guessed correctly.\n\n\u201cF*ck you! You\u2019re so cruel.\u201d Han Sen knew that his Jadeskin was too low level. If he had an eighth or ninth-tier Jadeskin, he might have been able to fight against Lando. But right now, he was too weak. If this continued, Lando would completely shatter his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cThe bodies of the Dragons are so scary, but their true talent lies in using Evilbreaker powers, right? Lando is so strong, perhaps the tales are true.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s chest was growing tight with tension. He used movement abilities to fight with Lando.\n\nGuys like Lando, who favored raw aggression and violence, usually didn\u2019t develop a very sophisticated movement set.\n\nLando had a very powerful body and amazing strength, and he could usually beat his enemies outright. He wouldn\u2019t have to study his enemies before engaging them in combat.\n\nBut when Han Sen started to use his movement abilities, he noticed that they didn\u2019t benefit him much against Lando. It turned out that Lando could also move pretty well, and in that high-speed magical fight, Han Sen didn\u2019t have a single advantage. He had to fight Lando on even footing. After a few more hits, his arms felt as if they were about to break.\n\nPang!\n\nLando\u2019s fists came down on Han Sen\u2019s arms like hammers. His jade-covered arms had sustained too much damage, and cracks spread across them. When the final blow landed, they were completely broken. Lando\u2019s unstoppable fists flew forward to clobber Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s chest exploded like water, but the splashing water drew itself back together and reformed. His wounds recovered very quickly.\n\nThe Original Water King body wasn\u2019t as strong as Jadeskin, but its recovery speed was much better. It was quite useful, after all.\n\nLando didn\u2019t keep attacking. He looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYou either come with me now, or I turn you into a cripple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou live up to your reputation, Lando, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to go home with you,\u201d Han Sen blinked and said. \u201cHow about this? Your body is so strong, yes? If you can withstand three of my blows without falling, I will stop fighting and let you take me back. Even if people come to save me, I will not run.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Lando agreed to the proposition without a second thought.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very determined man.\u201d Han Sen gave him a thumbs up.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, then,\u201d Lando said coldly.\n\n\u201cMy three hits require some time to prepare, but in the meantime, I can\u2019t deal with your constant attacks. We have a deal. If you fight me before I finish my three attacks, then you lose,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cStrike,\u201d Lando said in an emotionless voice. His face was wholly unmoving.\n\n\u201cThat means you are agreeing. Take my first hit, then,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he gathered up power in his fist. Jadeskin was running at full power, and he used the Yin Yang Blast method to strike Lando\u2019s chest.\n\nLando remained where he was. He didn\u2019t dodge, and he didn\u2019t run. He allowed Han Sen\u2019s punch to fall on his chest.\n\nThe punch was silent, but Han Sen had woven his scary ice-sealing power with the Yin Force. It drilled right into Lando\u2019s chest to freeze his organs."
