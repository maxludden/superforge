    "text": "Han Sen quickly fell back as Black Cliff roared. His body was on fire, and he leaped towards Han Sen like a beast. He was shouting, \u201cKnife Blank! My Knife Blank!\u201d\n\nIn that precise moment, the meeting room was blown up by the power unleashed by Black Cliff. His Duke powers were scary to witness.\n\nMany people heard the commotion and came rushing toward them. Han Sen shouted, \u201cPlease stay away! Run, as far as you are able to!\u201d\n\nHan Sen held onto the Knife Blank and also ran. The rabbit shoes were on his feet, and he headed out of the base.\n\nBlack Cliff was like a hungry beast as he ravenously pursued Han Sen. He summoned a big black hammer and swung it forward. The fire was like a living thing as it tore a big hole in the ground. The nearby houses were being smashed to pieces.\n\nLuckily, the rabbit shoes made Han Sen just as fast as Black Cliff. Han Sen made it out of the base, but he hadn\u2019t gained enough of a lead to lose Black Cliff.\n\nBlack Cliff ran like a lunatic. He kept trying to smack Han Sen with the hammer. He wanted to smash Han Sen into nothing but bits and take the Knife Blank for himself.\n\n\u201cKing Jun, that *sshole! He is so obscene.\u201d Han Sen knew that Black Cliff was not himself. The fire in his eyes was growing brighter, and he attacked without holding back.\n\nIt was fortunate Han Sen had the rabbit shoes; otherwise, he\u2019d be mush right now.\n\n\u201cZero, contact Queen!\u201d Han Sen shouted as he kept running. He was running towards the mountains, leading Black Cliff away from the base so he wouldn\u2019t inadvertently destroy it.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t lose him, but he used his Dongxuan Movements to dodge each attack. He kept evading as he led the raging Rebate towards the Red Mist Valley.\n\nHan Sen could not fight Black Cliff. He needed Yisha to help, but god only knew how long it would take her to get here. So, he needed to find a way to buy himself some time. It\u2019d be bad to suffer even a single strike.\n\nA random Duke class hit could be enough to break him to pieces.\n\nHan Sen guided Black Cliff towards the red mist, and in the meantime, Zero got in touch with Yisha. Yisha had the time to see her message.\n\n\u201cWhat? This has really happened? Black Cliff did this?\u201d After Yisha heard Zero explain the matters at hand, she frowned.\n\nShe could not believe he was willing to do such a thing.\n\nBut it was Han Sen\u2019s subordinate that had contacted her, and she knew Zero wouldn\u2019t lie. Yisha went quiet and quickly left for Planet Eclipse. She was soon at the base.\n\n\u201cWhere are Black Cliff and Han Sen?\u201d Yisha asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cMaster was getting chased. He was leading the enemy off that way!\u201d Zero pointed to Red Mist Valley.\n\nYisha did not delay. Like an act of teleportation, she instantly disappeared.\n\nYisha was in a major rush right now. If what Zero had told her was true, then there was a Duke chasing after Han Sen. It was difficult to gauge how long Han Sen might last in such a pursuit. He could have been whacked into jelly by now, already.\n\nYisha scanned the valley ahead, and what she saw shocked her.\n\nHan Sen was sitting on a rock outside the valley, singing.\n\n\u201cWhere is Black Cliff?\u201d Yisha asked as she ran up to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIn that valley,\u201d Han Sen said, as he pointed down into it.\n\nHan Sen had drawn Black Cliff into the valley, and his pursuer had gotten lost in there. Han Sen was able to get back out and wait for Yisha\u2019s arrival. Black Cliff was still down there.\n\nYisha looked into the valley with much confusion. Her face changed and she said, \u201cA Red Mist Spring?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d Han Sen asked Yisha.\n\nYisha looked at the red mist plaguing the valley and said, \u201cIt is a Red Mist Spring. I don\u2019t know if it is good for you or bad for you, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Red Mist Spring?\u201d Han Sen felt a chill hearing this, but he asked her for more info.\n\nThey had been in the valley searching for quite some time, last time they were there. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything useful inside. They couldn\u2019t find what was causing the mist, either. Even if there was a treasure, it seemed unlikely they could find it.\n\nNow hearing Yisha say this, it sounded as if it might not have been treasure that was inside there. It might have actually been something harmful.\n\nJust as Yisha was about to answer, Black Cliff came out of the clouds with a big hammer. After seeing Han Sen, he roared and swung towards him.\n\nYisha frowned. She could tell something was wrong with him, and she knew he wouldn\u2019t behave like that in front of her.\n\nShe waved her hand and a purple mist came out. It cracked Black Cliff\u2019s big hammer in an instant.\n\nBlack Cliff coughed up some blood. The hammer was his geno armament, and as soon as Yisha broke it, harm was delivered to his body. But even so, he still wanted to go after Han Sen and Han Sen alone. He was acting like a man possessed.\n\nYisha then hit Black Cliff himself with the purple mist. She didn\u2019t want to kill him, though. All she wanted to do was knock him out.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let others learn about this spring. I will discuss this with you when I return.\u201d Yisha told Han Sen that, then picked up the unconscious Black Cliff. After that, she warped away.\n\nHan Sen went back to the base. After what happened with Black Cliff, he knew he\u2019d have to be more careful. King Jun was able to use Black Cliff to come after him, so it was clear he could assume the form of other people to get to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHaving an association with a god is a bad thing, indeed. They are so powerful, but they won\u2019t kill directly. Why is that? Maybe if I find out why, I can kill King Jun.\u201d Han Sen retreated into thought.\n\nWhen it was nighttime, Han Sen sought rest. When he turned around, he saw Yisha standing right there. She had been behind him, and her sudden presence there scared him.\n\n\u201cQueen, when did you get here?\u201d Han Sen blinked.\n\nYisha smiled and said, \u201cI just wanted to take a look at you. I almost don\u2019t recognize you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Why would you not recognize your student?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cUnder the threat of Black Cliffs pursuit, you managed to run so far and so fast without sustaining any damage. I don\u2019t even think a Marquise could do such a thing.\u201d Yisha squinted her eyes as she spoke.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have shoes that can give me speed. I\u2019m weak in other talents, so I guess I\u2019m just good when it comes to being speedy. These take me up to around Duke class, I think.\u201d Han Sen said that, and then used his rabbit shoes to walk three meters.\n\nThat is a good item. It gives Barons the speed of a Duke. That is very rare. It is better than your holy item, even.\u201d Yisha looked at the rabbit shoes as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen felt strange, all of a sudden. He was afraid Yisha might want to try them on. They were a beast soul, and Yisha couldn\u2019t use them because she was not from the sanctuaries.\n\nFortunately, she was not interested in the rabbit shoes. She thought of something else and said, \u201cDo you know what the Red Mist Spring is?\u201d"
