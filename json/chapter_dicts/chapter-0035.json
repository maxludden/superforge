    "text": "Ass Freak was so infamous that a torrent of scornful abuse was lavished on him. The young men who were paying came to them, and one of them with harsh, angular features curiously looked at Han Sen and said, \"You are the legendary Ass Freak?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Han Sen answered casually. He did not think it was a bad thing, because in the entire Steel Armor Shelter, he was the only one who had ever stabbed Qin Xuan in the butt. This was a kind of achievement in a sense.\n\nThe young man was obviously curious about Han Sen. Suddenly he said, \"You are also here for the job?\"\n\nHan Sen nodded: \"If you don\u2019t like the idea, I can go right now.\"\n\n\"No, if you do not have any questions, we can sign the contract right here,\" the young man quickly said.\n\nA roar went up in the crowd as they heard the young man\u2019s decision. Even the young man\u2019s friends looked surprised. They pulled the young man to the side and said, \"Yuan, that\u2019s Ass Freak. What are you going to do with him?\"\n\n\"That\u2019s right, Yuan. If we are in danger, he will probably run even faster than us. It\u2019s just a waste of money.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve hired him, and you can choose the rest,\" the young man named Yuan insisted and signed the contract with Han Sen.\n\nThe others didn\u2019t say much after that and selected several more candidates who looked experienced. Han Hao showed them his mutant beast soul weapon and was chosen. The two coming with Han Hao showed some skill and got the job as well.\n\n\"Ass Freak, you got lucky thanks to your young master\u2019s kindness and curiosity,\" Liu Feng, one of the two, said when walking past Han Sen.\n\n\"My luck has always been good,\" Han Sen said faintly.\n\nThe clients had selected ten experienced men to protect them in hunting primitive creatures. With such a team, they could even hunt primitive creatures by herd.\n\nThose who had been hired were in a good mood and tried to flatter the clients all the time. They clearly understood the background of these young men who were paying them.\n\nThe clients actually had very good fighting skills, and they must have graduated from posh schools. Although they had just entered God\u2019s Sanctuary, their fitness and skills were much better than Han Sen\u2019s when he had just arrived. They were only lacking the experience of hunting.\n\nWhen the clients were hunting primitive creatures, Han Sen was just practicing archery on the side. Initially he had chosen to practice archery because it was less demanding than other weapons. He was unlikely to be able to learn advanced techniques of sword or knife fighting in the public education system, while all he needed for archery was accuracy.\n\nHan Sen was still getting to know the performance and characteristics of Doomsday, so he had selected some of the trees nearby as his targets to practice on.\n\n\"Ass Freak, you are just taking up space. Why are you shooting in vain and ignoring our clients?\" Liu Feng was confused by Han Sen\u2019s behavior and looked at his shots contemptuously. \"You can\u2019t even shoot something within 60 feet.\"\n\nHan Sen did not look at Liu Feng or reply to him. He was just trying the arrow and did not focus on one target, and that was why his shots looked messy.\n\n\"Just let him be. It was just a charity act. Our clients didn\u2019t expect him to help at all,\" other hired hands laughed.\n\n\"That is true. Just be grateful, Ass Freak!\" Liu Feng spit and joined the rest.\n\n\"Do not say you know me,\" Han Hao found a chance to whisper to Han Sen and went back to laugh with his friends.\n\nThe clients were making incredible progress. In the beginning, they needed some assistance, while they soon became better and could hunt some rather vicious primitive creatures one-on-one. Indeed, posh schools had great teaching outcomes.\n\nThose who were in integrated compulsory education wouldn\u2019t dare to hunt primitive creatures alone with no previous experience.\n\nIt went so well that everyone lost their vigilance. When the clients were hunting three primitive spotted beasts, one of the beasts played dead and attacked a young client when he approached it.\n\nHan Hao and others didn\u2019t expect this, and the spotted beast was too close to the client for them to rescue him. In an instant, the claws of the spotted beast were on the delicate neck of the young man.\n\nThe young client was horrified, regretting that he wasn\u2019t wearing his alloy helmet. But it was too late for that. Everyone watching screamed in horror.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nAn arrow flew by the client\u2019s face and hit the spotted beast in the left eye. The beast whimpered and fell to the ground.\n\nHan Hao and the rest swarmed to the spotted beast and cut its corpse into pieces.\n\n\"Ass Freak, why did you shoot the arrow? You almost hurt Qing!\" Liu Feng turned around and scolded Han Sen.\n\nOther people all followed him, criticizing Han Sen. They were secretly ashamed, but instead of self-reflection, they chose to blame Han Sen. In their view, Han Sen just shot the beast by pure luck, because Ass Freak could never be so good at anything.\n\n\"Get lost!\" Yuan suddenly shouted with a dark face.\n\n\"Did you hear that Ass Freak? Yuan just asked you to go,\" cried Liu Feng.\n\n\"I\u2019m letting you go.\" Yuan stared at Liu Feng coldly. \"I paid you to protect us, and what did you do when Qing was in danger? Nothing! And you even tried to blame the only person who did his job. All of you, get lost, and I don\u2019t want to see you again.\""
