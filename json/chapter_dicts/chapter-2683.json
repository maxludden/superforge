He could teleport away before the punch came down on him, and it seemed like the only viable choice to ensure his own survival. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he carried on fighting with his now-broken body.\n\nBut considering how injured and outmatched he was, it seemed unlikely that any strength he mustered would be enough to withstand a punch delivered by Shale.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know his place! Kill him!\u201d Liyu Zhen clenched his fists into tight, white-knuckled balls. His eyes were red as he shouted spitefully at the video feed.\n\nLi Xue Cheng was the same. This fight was about to end in exactly the way he had been hoping for all along. They were going to win the bet.\n\nThere was no way that Han Sen could avoid the punch that was coming down on him. And there were only two possible results of trying to block that blow: he could either die or be disabled. Whichever actually happened, Han Sen couldn\u2019t reasonably carry on fighting. No one was going to stop Shale from reaching first place in the silkworm bout.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fist struck that scary punch. The armor that protected his fists and his arms exploded, and Han Sen\u2019s entire body flew forward. As he sailed through the air, his Spell armor shattered to pieces like a broken vase.\n\n\u201cGame over.\u201d Open Sky Elder was very sad to see this. He thought he had lost his Open Sky jewelry.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer\u2019s faces changed. Han Sen\u2019s heart never gave up hope. He kept sending them the message that he could keep on going, no matter the odds, but his self geno armor was broken, and his body was severely injured. Hopefully, he would survive, but he couldn\u2019t keep on fighting.\n\nNow, they could only pray that Han Sen didn\u2019t succumb to the remaining force of the impact. Exquisite was tempted to leap onto the battlefield to save him from doom.\n\nMany of the Very High people who had believed Han Sen was going to win were now all silent. Han Sen had tried his best, but there was too much of a gap between the powers of a King and a deified. Shale was too strong, and so they couldn\u2019t blame Han Sen for losing. However, their hearts bled when they thought about everything they had bet and were going to lose.\n\nOnly Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen were excited enough to start jumping around with glee. They almost hugged each other.\n\nAfter this fight, they\u2019d reap a bounty of rewards. The resources they were about to receive might support them all the way up to the deified butterfly class. And on top of that, they\u2019d also lay claim to priceless treasures of untold might.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body slammed against the seal again. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng were ready to start clapping, but they suddenly froze in place.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only members of the audience who were staring in shock. Everyone was. After Han Sen\u2019s body hit the seal, he didn\u2019t fall to the ground. He just remained where he was. He was floating.\n\nThat broken body of his was releasing a weird shockwave that they could barely detect. Then, his form became shrouded in bright light.\n\nBut when they looked closer, they could see that it wasn\u2019t a bright light. It was a cloud of white powder-like dust. And the white powder was gathering around Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, a white set of armor had wrapped itself around Han Sen\u2019s body. The broken Spell armor was back, and it looked as good as new.\n\nNo. It was even more powerful than before it had been damaged. The symbol on the armor was shining brilliantly, releasing a scary presence. The holy light wrapped slowly around Han Sen\u2019s body. He was like some god spirit from a holy mountain.\n\n\u201cHe is becoming half-deified!\u201d Exquisite and Li Keer were the first to react to this. They could feel that Han Sen\u2019s power was exploding in the breadth of its magnitude.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of all that, he became half-deified\u2026 This guy is too much.\u201d Many of the Very High who were watching the fight looked absolutely stunned.\n\nIt was possible to level up during a fight, but leveling up required a lot of power to support. In Shale\u2019s case, he had already taken in the Demon Fruit, and he was supremely powerful already. So, it made a certain amount of sense that he was able to break through during a fight and become deified.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s body was entirely broken. His self armor had been wrecked. In that injured state of his, it should have been impossible for him to level up.\n\nBut Han Sen had become half-deified in that situation. It was a difficult thing to grasp.\n\n\u201cSo what if he is half-deified? Half-deifieds are just another form of King class. He can\u2019t fight Shale,\u201d Li Xue Cheng snarled, gnashing his teeth.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t happy to see this. He only hoped Shale still had what it took to kill his opponent quickly.\n\nBut Shale merely looked at Han Sen. He didn\u2019t attack him like Li Xue Cheng wanted him to.\n\n\u201cYou are a perplexing man. You became half-deified, even in the middle of all this,\u201d Shale said while looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIt was just a stroke of good luck,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\nShale shook his head with a grave sense of gravitas. \u201cThere is no such thing as luck in this universe. Luck is a rigged lottery. Any winner might think that they are lucky, but no matter how lucky they are, they wouldn\u2019t have won if they never bought the ticket.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He really hadn\u2019t been depending on luck.\n\nJust before Shale\u2019s last punch, Han Sen had finally come to understand the key that would allow the nine tiers of The Story of Genes to combine into one. He realized how to become half-deified. That was why he had taken that punch. That power was enough to make his Spell armor break completely and then rebuild itself.\n\n\u201cBut what a shame. If you were deified, we could really see which of us is better,\u201d Shale said with a look of regret.\n\n\u201cWe can still find out, I think. Like I told you once before, our fight has not yet ended,\u201d Han Sen said expressionlessly.\n\nShale shook his head and said nothing. He was happy to admit that Han Sen was strong, but half-deified was still King class. Han Sen wasn\u2019t as strong as him. He still didn\u2019t think Han Sen had enough power to challenge him.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, let us end this here. The Apollo Set can be set aside for now. When you become deified, you can fight me for it. And if you win, you can take the Apollo Set,\u201d Shale said after a brief moment of thought.\n\nA good opponent was like a fine wine; it needed time to truly reach its potential. Shale wanted Han Sen to become deified before he fought him again.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t have the patience to wait that long. Seeing that Shale wasn\u2019t going to attack, Han Sen decided to stop talking. Instead, he lifted his hand like a knife, then used Fang to strike at Shale.\n\nShale frowned. He had already decided to end the fight. He gathered up demonic powers again, and his fist became a demonic lion that went straight for Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nJust like before, Shale\u2019s fist blurred forward, and Han Sen\u2019s power transformed into the demonic mirror of Shale\u2019s own abilities.\n\n\u201cIt is the same. Does Han Sen not understand that if his power is forced to match Shale\u2019s, he can never beat him\u2026?\u201d Li Xue Cheng trailed off halfway through his statement.\n\nThe demonic power had definitely sunk into Han Sen\u2019s body, but the powers that Han Sen was using for his attacks were not demonic like before. The Teeth Knife he lashed out with was still a purple knife. It was not affected by the demonic power."
