    "text": "Han Sen did not like making wishes. He knew what had happened to Dawn, Uncle Bug, and the Ning family\u2019s Second Mister, and it had completely soured him on the concept of making wishes.\n\nHan Sen did not think Skygod was a good character.\n\nChiron Earl had made a wish, but he was killed alongside the rest of his helpers.\n\nHe did not know if Wind Viscount had made a wish, but he had died, too. And on top of that, he had infected the rest of Han Sen\u2019s people back at base with the sacrificial marking.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. And there were only two wishes he could realistically make. One wish was to ask Skygod to erase everyone\u2019s markings, but that was something that Skygod was suspiciously leading him to request. If he wasn\u2019t leading Han Sen on, he wouldn\u2019t have mentioned the possibility in the first place.\n\nHan Sen did not think he was any more important than Wood Duke. But Skygod had spoken a lot more to Han Sen, and so it was fairly obvious that Skygod wanted something from him.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t make this wish. Even if everyone did get their markings removed, the egg was still around. The infection, in some way, would go on. And on top of that, Han Sen only had one Raven feather.\n\nHe could also wish for the Raven to be born without the need for a sacrifice.\n\nAccording to what Skygod had told him, if the Raven was born, the markings would be useless. The people with them would not be hurt, and if anything, those who had been marked would only benefit.\n\nBut Han Sen couldn\u2019t be sure this was the truth just because Skygod had said so. It might just be another way that Skygod was trying to deceive him.\n\nIf this was the truth, there was the whole matter of pondering what to do once the Raven was born. It required a grand sacrifice for its birth, so only the gods knew how much it would later require, as it grew up.\n\nAt least it wouldn\u2019t have the ability to kill, presumably. But that couldn\u2019t be known until it was born. It could actually be scarier once it was born than when it was in the egg.\n\nWishes like that seemed too dangerous to Han Sen. But the silver fox, Xie Qing King, and Gu Qingcheng possessed the mark. If he didn\u2019t sort this out soon, everyone here could die.\n\n\u201cMake your wish.\u201d Sun Skygod\u2019s voice boomed again, echoing across the hall.\n\nHan Sen did not bring out the steel feather yet, though. He just asked, \u201cLord Skygod, is there anyone else like you, that can grant a wish through sacrifices?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with your wish,\u201d Sun Skygod said.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with my wish, but I had a few friends who made a wish to a so-called god. Their dreams might have come true, but ultimately, their lives all turned to misery. I am afraid of ending up like them. I don\u2019t want to make a wish and find myself unable to enjoy it,\u201d Han Sen said slowly.\n\n\u201cI am not that kind of god,\u201d Sun Skygod said.\n\n\u201cSo, you are saying there are other gods like you?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes turned bright. He had been looking for that god for a long time, but he had never been able to pick up on a single lead. He hadn\u2019t expected to find one here.\n\n\u201cYou cannot compare those fake gods to someone like me,\u201d Sun Skygod said in irritation.\n\nNow Han Sen knew that other gods did exist. And now Han Sen wanted to know information concerning the gods Skygod knew, and whether one of them was the god that the Seventh Team had encountered.\n\nHan Sen wished to ask something more, but Sun Skygod said, \u201cI am going to rest. Give me your feather and make the wish now, or wait another thousand years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate the offer. I\u2019ll think about it, and maybe I\u2019ll make this wish in a thousand years,\u201d Han Sen said, then tried to exit the purple-bronze palace.\n\nWhen he had entered the palace, he stayed near the door. He didn\u2019t enter too far, so he thought he could bolt outside quickly enough if something bad happened.\n\nBut now Han Sen noticed he had underestimated Skygod. As he tried to reach the door, the door suddenly looked so far away. He wouldn\u2019t be able to reach it.\n\nYou are a little creature no greater than an ant. Where do you think you are? You cannot come and go so simply. Make your wish with your feather, or I will send you to hell. You will suffer for the rest of eternity, mark my words.\u201d Sun Skygod sounded a little peeved.\n\n\u201cI told you I have no wish to make,\u201d Han Sen responded.\n\nThen think about it, right here, right now.\u201d Sun Skygod coldly went on to say, \u201cBut hurry. You might end up dying before you are able to make a wish.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned, not understanding what Skygod meant. But soon, he did.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fingers and hair grew quickly. He began growing a long beard, as something else occurred to his skin.\n\nTime has sped up!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face changed.\n\nWood Duke and all the others were shocked. Controlling time really was something only a god could do.\n\nHan Sen looked at his body. With the speed he was aging, his few-hundred-year lifespan would be over in a few hours.\n\n\u201cI am Skygod. I can do anything, if it is what I desire.\u201d Skygod sounded cold. It didn\u2019t look as if he was showing off, though. This was something ordinary for him.\n\n\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you just take the feather. Why do I have to make a sacrifice?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s body was getting older, but he wasn\u2019t panicking yet.\n\nHan Sen had the powers of space and time himself. Although he wasn\u2019t as strong as Skygod, Skygod couldn\u2019t bluff him. When Han Sen spoke, Skygod went quiet and did not say anything more.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body kept getting older. His hair had reached his feet, and the beard had reached the ground. He wanted to leave the hall, more than anything. But even at full-speed, he couldn\u2019t reach the door. It was always one step away from him.\n\n\u201cOld Han, I am coming!\u201d Xie Qing King shouted, wishing to barge into the hall. He did not care if there was a god inside or not.\n\nGu Qingcheng pulled out her sword named Pure. She readied herself to help Xie Qing King and Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in! I know what to do.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s shout prevented Xie Qing King from coming in."
