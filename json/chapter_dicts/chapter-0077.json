    "text": "One of the familiar faces was Fang Jingqi. Han Sen had never seen him again since playing red hands with him and was surprised to see him here today.\n\nAs for the other person, Han Sen felt like having seen him somewhere, but the guy was in a high collar windbreaker, a hat and a pair of oversized sunglasses, which made it difficult for Han Sen to tell who he was.\n\nThe man wearing sunglasses was waving at them, but Han Sen soon found out that the man was not waving at him, but at Qu Wange.\n\nAs soon as Han Sen and Qu Wange were out of the school gate, Fang Jingqi and his friend came over. The man wearing sunglasses started to talk to Qu Wanger immediately. They seemed by know each other well.\n\nFang Jingxi was reluctant to smile at Han Sen. \"Han Sen, I did not expect to meet you here. Who is this beautiful little girl?\"\n\n\"This is my sister Han Yan, I came to pick her up. I\u2019ll let you guys talk,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"You did not come in an aircraft? Let me give you a ride,\" said Qu Wange when she saw Han Sen leaving for maglev station with Han Yan in his arms.\n\nThe man in sunglasses said reluctantly, \"Since you all know each other, let\u2019s go to dinner together.\n\n\"I will not bother you. I have some errands to do, so I\u2019ll go back first. Ms. Qu, we will just use the train,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"No way\u2026 your parents are outrageous.\" Qu Wange did not see Han Sen as an adult. Indeed, he was just about seventeen and was young and comely, which made him look more like a teenager than a man.\n\n\"You and Yan can come with us to eat first, and I will give you a ride home after.\" As a teacher, Qu Wange was an authority figure, not taking no for an answer.\n\n\"Han Sen, since Ms. Qu has put it this way, just join us for dinner. We are all friends, right?\" Fang Jingqi smiled and advised. It seemed that he suddenly had an idea.\n\nIn fact, Han Sen was not going to refuse as Qu Wange had already picked Yan up and walked toward her aircraft.\n\nThe man in sunglasses seemed a bit unhappy, but he did not dare to show it in front of Qu.\n\nHan Sen and Han Yan were on Qu\u2019s aircraft, while the man in sunglasses was on Fang\u2019s aircraft. Just when he sat down, the man in sunglasses asked Fang Jingqi, \"Jingqi, who is that kid? Why did Wange care about him so much?\"\n\n\"That kid is a boy toy liked by many women. Probably Wange is into him as well,\" Fang Jingqi said with a straight face.\n\n\"Jingqi, Roca is basically your planet. You are just going to watch Wange falling into his lap?\" said the man in sunglasses. Thinking about Han Sen\u2019s look, he agreed that he had nicer skin than many girls and believed what Fang Jingqi told him.\n\nIn fact, Han Sen just had nice skin because he was practicing Jadeskin.\n\n\"What can I do about it? They are both consensual adults, so I can\u2019t really beat the kid up for that. I am afraid that Wange wouldn\u2019t let me either,\" Fang Jingqi shrugged and said.\n\n\"You are so weak man! Just wait and see how I scare him off without really hurting him,\" the man in sunglasses curled his lip and said. He took his sunglasses off and it chanced that he was Tang Zhenliu, the fifth among the ten Chosen last year.\n\n\"Great, I\u2019ll see how you do it,\" Fang Jingqi said with suspicious sparkles in his eyes. He thought, \"Brat, you\u2019ve given me a lot of troubles these days. I\u2019ll let you suffer a bit to ease my anger. Han Sen is a formidable opponent and I\u2019ll see how you are scared off by him.\"\n\nSince Fang Jingqi suffered in Han Sen\u2019s hand last time, he had been afraid of Han Sen. This time, however, he could use Han Sen to make Tang Zhenliu suffer.\n\nTang Zhenliu was quite something, but Fang Jingqi could still make correct predictions about him. However, he really lost his confidence when playing red hands with Han Sen.\n\nIf Tang Zhenliu and Han Sen were in a fight, Fang Jingqi did not think that Han Sen would win. But if it was just games played at dinner table, Fang Jingqi believed Tang Zhenliu would be miserable.\n\nFang Jingqi also wanted to see Tang Zhenliu completely defeated by Han Sen, so that Tang wouldn\u2019t brag about himself all day, as if everyone should worship him because he was the Chosen.\n\nThe place they were heading to was a club exclusive to the distinguished and aristocrats. Han Sen and Yan weren\u2019t qualified to enter, but since the rest of the party were all VIPs there, they could be the plus ones.\n\nInside the private room, Tang Zhenliu took off his sunglasses and hat, smiled and reached out a hand to Han Sen. \"Haven\u2019t introduced myself. My name is Tang Zhenliu.\"\n\nTang thought to himself while smiling, \"Tang Zhenliu the star is here! You must be stunned by my name. It would be great if you and your sister happen to be my fans and ask for my signature.\"\n\n\"My name is Han Sen.\" Han Sen shook his hand and said, unimpressed.\n\nHe did recognize Tang Zhenliu, but he wasn\u2019t really interested in stars. He was always busy making a living, and had no time to gather information about the stars. That was why he wasn\u2019t star-struck at all.\n\nTang Zhenliu felt at loss. Even if Han Sen wasn\u2019t a fan, he should still have a bigger reaction than that. But he acted as if he had just seen a passer-by!\n\n\"Is he an alien? He does not know me. Me, Tang Zhenliu!\" Tang wanted to grab Han Sen and tell the kid his name again. The only reason he wasn\u2019t doing it was Qu Wange who was sitting at the table.\n\nFang Jingqi almost laughed out loud\u2014he naturally knew what Tang was thinking.\n\nSoon the waiter brought them a variety of food and drinks that looked expensive. Han Sen and Han Yan had never had any of these before.\n\nSince it was someone else\u2019s treat, Han Sen ate without manners and was putting nice food into Yan\u2019s plate from time to time. Yan did not engorge like her brother did, but also enjoyed the food quite a lot.\n\nQu Wange was displeased with Han Sen\u2019s rudeness, but liked Han Yan more and more.\n\n\"Fortunately, Han Yan was sent to Saint Paul and made my student. Or such a good girl as her would be ruined by her family.\" Qu Wange was secretly determined to teach Yan well and keep her away from her brother."
