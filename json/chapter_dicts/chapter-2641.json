    "text": "Exquisite didn\u2019t answer, and the two of them continued on toward the heavenly land.\n\nFlocks of phoenixes flew overhead, and holy springs were suspended in the air, surrounded by clouds. Giant dragons walked majestically across the ground, which was covered with many strange flowers and rich green grass. There were many rare animals, too. There were strange and exotic things everywhere that Han Sen looked.\n\nWithin seconds of landing, Han Sen had seen three deified xenogeneics. One of them was a deified plant.\n\n\u201cThis is so scary\u2026 I understand now why the Very High are regarded as the greatest race in the universe. There are so many resources here. The mighty Extreme King have far less than this\u2026 No\u2026 They can\u2019t even be compared. Put side by side with the Very High, the Extreme King would look like a group of hobos.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was in too much shock to speak. Countless powerful xenogeneics were roaming about. And in the nearby forest, deified xenogeneics were everywhere.\n\nStill aboard Equisite\u2019s ship, they flew onward for tens of thousands of miles. There were countless deified xenogeneics nearby, but they had yet to encounter any of the Very High.\n\n\u201cEver since our race found this place in ancient times, our elders have been bringing interesting xenogeneics here. After god knows how many billions of years, this is what has become of the place. But my people reproduce very slowly. There are only two hundred of us left now, and we cannot use the vast majority of the resources that we have gathered over the ages. However, the creatures we have collected breed and breed; they are the fruits of our labor,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\nSO\n\nHan Sen understood why the Very High could make so many deified elites now. This place was like an organic treasury. With the resources available, creating deified elites would be easy.\n\nBao\u2019er was lying comfortably on the floor of the ship, looking around at the weird flowers and strange grasses. They didn\u2019t look special, but Han Sen knew Bao\u2019er. He could tell she was prepared to take action.\n\nThe small boat continued to fly forward. After a while, Han Sen started to think that there was a problem with the flow of time in this place. He couldn\u2019t accurately determine how much time had passed since he first saw land.\n\nTheir ship was drawing close to some cloud-covered mountains, and when they came within range, Han Sen finally saw that the mountains held a collection of palaces. They had been built into and around the mountains, fitting perfectly between them. Faintly obscured by the haze of the clouds, it was like a picture of heaven.\n\nWhen the ship landed at the foot of the mountains, Han Sen noticed a stone staircase. It led all the way up to the stone palace at the mountain\u2019s peak. There was a Very High man descending the steps.\n\n\u201cExquisite, you have returned!\u201d\n\nPerhaps there was such a thing as a place where the grass was greener, for being born in such a heavenly environment seemed to breed people gracious enough to befit it.\n\n\u201cSecond Brother.\u201d Exquisite stepped off the ship and bowed before the man.\n\nThe man waved his hand, signaling for her to refrain from such politeness. He looked at Han Sen and saw Bao\u2019er sitting on his shoulder. He frowned. \u201cThird Sister, why have you brought two people? Which one is your silkworm?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is Han Sen. I selected him. That is his daughter. He had to bring her with him because there was no one else willing to look after her in his absence,\u201d Exquisite explained.\n\nThe man nodded and stopped looking at Han Sen and Bao\u2019er. He told Exquisite, \u201cGo. The altar is ready. We may complete the contracts now.\u201d\n\nExquisite nodded and told Han Sen, \u201cYou guys follow me. Don\u2019t stray too far.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded. He stepped off the ship. As soon as he left the boarding ramp, his body felt as if it was being crushed by a mountain. He moved a bit slower than usual.\n\n\u201cThe environment of Outer Sky is different from that of the outside universe. You\u2019ll just have to get used to it,\u201d Exquisite told Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen nodded. He remained silent and followed Exquisite up the grand staircase. He glanced around.\n\n\u201cSister, you could have chosen Lone Bamboo of the Sky. Why did you pick a crystallizer? Crystallizer bodies are unremarkable. They cannot amount to much\u2026\u201d the man said to Exquisite as they ascended the steps. He certainly didn\u2019t beat around the bush.\n\n\u201cWhy does this guy not look like one of the Very High?\u201d Han Sen wondered as he inspected the man. The man\u2019s insult hadn\u2019t bothered him.\n\nThe fellow looked different from Li Keer, Bixi, and Exquisite. He looked fairly average, in truth. He didn\u2019t appear to be as cold as the other Very High that Han Sen had encountered so far.\n\nExquisite said something non-committal, clearly not interested in the conversation.\n\nThe four of them reached the halfway point on their journey up the mountain. There, they found a stone pavilion residing on a stone platform. The stone pavilion\u2019s name was written as \u201cHalf-Life Fate.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what it meant, but another man soon approached. He waved his hand at Han Sen and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come here to be Exquisite\u2019s silkworm? According to the rules of the Very High, only someone with a nine armor talent is eligible to sign the contract. Allow me to test you.\u201d\n\nThe man didn\u2019t seem to know Han Sen had already been tested. He walked him to the pavilion and opened a stone canister that was cradled by a stone table. When the lid was removed, Han Sen could see another God Spirit Touch lying inside the canister.\n\n\u201cGive the God Spirit Touch a drop of your blood and wait for the results.\u201d The man pointed at the God Spirit Touch for Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSecond Brother, there is no need to test him. Brother Bixi has already tested him with a God Spirit Touch. He has an armor talent figure of eleven. He is more than suitable to be a silkworm,\u201d Exquisite said.\u201cAn eleven armor talent? He\u2019s just a crystallizer. He cannot have an eleven armor talent. You\u2019re joking with us, surely. Or did Bixi make a mistake? The meager talents of crystallizers aside, even we of the Very High very rarely produce offspring with an armor talent of eleven\u2026 So he still needs to undergo this test. I don\u2019t want a mistaken test result to delay this process.\u201d The man\u2019s mouth was like a machine gun as he kept talking.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t bother paying attention to the man\u2019s rambling. He approached the stone canister and lifted the middle finger of his right hand. He squeezed out a drop of blood and gave it to the God Spirit\u2019s Touch.\n\nExquisite\u2019s eyes locked on the God Spirit Touch. Despite what she had said earlier, she did want to find out if the test conducted before was legitimate. Saying Han Sen had an eleven armor talent still seemed ludicrous, so a second test was warranted.\n\nThe man stared at the God Spirit Touch, too. He didn\u2019t believe a crystallizer could have an eleven armor talent. He thought something must have happened when Bixi tested Han Sen, and that was why the result was incorrect.\n\nThey all stared at the God Spirit Touch intensely. But after the God Spirit Touch consumed the blood, it stopped moving. They kept watching for some time, but the creature remained completely still. It didn\u2019t even shed a single shell.\n\nExquisite was surprised, and the men thought this was strange. No matter how bad a crystallizer was, there was no way the bug wouldn\u2019t discard a single shell.\n\n\u201cWeird. Is there a problem with the God Spirit Touch?\u201d The man reached out a finger and brushed it against the God Spirit Touch\u2019s head. His face twisted with confusion as he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the creature. It is just the same as before. How could this happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeed him another drop of blood,\u201d the man told Han Sen after he examined the God Spirit Touch.Han Sen didn\u2019t know what to make of this turn of events. He did just as he was instructed and squeezed out another droplet of blood to feed the God Spirit Touch."
