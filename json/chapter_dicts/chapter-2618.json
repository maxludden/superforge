    "text": "In an office of Sky Palace, a collection of elders, officers, and other high-class people were discussing the events with great excitement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skill, here. It is one of Sky Palace\u2019s secret techniques. After being buried for all these years, it has finally been revealed. It should be a part of Sky Palace\u2019s armory. We can\u2019t allow an outsider to claim it. The one who got it was a foreign student, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. The Eleventh Elder left this request. How could we disobey his final wish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis only happened because he was too old to understand that the white elephant might unwittingly select an outsider. A foreign student, no less!\u201d The high-class people of Sky Palace had split into three different camps. One camp suggested putting the sword skill into Sky Palace\u2019s list of secret skills, where only the truly important figures of the Sky could view\n\nAnother camp believed they should honor the final command of the Eleventh Leader and allow Han Yan to practice the sword skill she had been given. The final group wanted to take the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skill to a place where they could research it. They wanted to modify it so all of Sky Palace\u2019s students could practice it.\n\n\u201cLeader, please say something.\u201d The Sixth Elder supported the group that wished to take the sword skill and put it on the restricted list. After the Sixth Elder spoke, everyone realized that Sky Palace Leader had yet to say anything in the discussion.\n\nSky Palace Leader said coldly, \u201cThere is no need to discuss this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Leader?\u201d Sky Chance Officer asked Sky Palace Leader with confusion.\n\nSky Palace Leader looked at him. Then, he turned his gaze back to everyone else who was present. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what decision we make if we can\u2019t get our hands on the sword skill, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy could we not get it? We can ask Han Yan to present it to us. Would she dare not to? It belongs to Sky Palace, and if you want to take it back, then we would be totally within our rights,\u201d Sky Chance Officer said flatly.\n\n\u201cYou really think that would be an acceptable course of action? Yes, you are technically correct. But it sounds to me like you\u2019re not giving any consideration to the Eleventh Leader and his request,\u201d Yun Changkong said mockingly.\n\n\u201cI would never insult the Eleventh Leader\u2026 However, I don\u2019t think the Eleventh Leader expected that he would end up handing over his skill to someone who wasn\u2019t even a Sky. We are merely fulfilling our responsibility as leaders of our people. I am sure that his spirit in heaven would agree with our decision,\u201d Sky Chance Officer said confidently.\n\nSky Palace Leader squinted, smiled, and said, \u201cSky Chance Officer is correct. We could argue that we were merely using our authority, but clearly, the Eleventh Leader knew we would want to take advantage of this situation. He sent his mount Hitting Sky Elephant to protect the skill and prevent young ones like us from stealing it under the guise of protecting our people. Do you have another plan to sort this out that involves the use of our authority?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf\u2026 if Han Yan is willing to hand it over, the Hitting Sky Big Elephant shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Sky Chance Officer said, before going quiet. He didn\u2019t believe a single word that he was saying. The skill wasn\u2019t recorded in text; rather, it had taken the form of a jade sword. The white elephant wouldn\u2019t part with the jade sword for a minute. The white elephant didn\u2019t care if Han Yan used the sword, but if anyone else came close to it, the Hitting Sky Elephant would attack them. The Sixth Elder was a prime example of what might happen if the white elephant got annoyed.\n\n\u201cThe Hitting Sky Elephant is just a low-intelligence xenogeneic. I doubt it knows much. We can trap it and take the jade sword away. How could it stop us then?\u201d an elder said with a hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cSeventh Elder, this is Sky Palace. We aren\u2019t a den of thieves,\u201d Yun Changkong said disparagingly.\n\n\u201cYun Changkong, don\u2019t let this become personal. Han Yan might be your student, but the sword skill is part of the legacy of Sky Palace. It isn\u2019t your personal possession\u2026\u201d the Seventh Elder said with a cold grunt.\n\nYun Changkong was enraged by this, and he said, \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d \u201cYou know what I mean. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cChangkong, what the Seventh Elder said makes sense. That is how we will settle this matter,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said to stop them both from fighting.\n\n\u201cLeader\u2026\u201d Yun Changkong said, looking sick.\n\n\u201cLeader, you are so smart.\u201d The Seventh Elder grinned widely.\n\nSky Palace Leader ignored Yun Changkong\u2019s icy stare. He smiled at the Seventh Elder and said, \u201cSince you were the one to suggest this idea, Seventh Elder, please proceed with your plan to trap the Hitting Sky Elephant. Then, bring the jade sword to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPalace Leader, how am I supposed to do it alone? I need you to send some more deifieds with me. I\u2019ll need them to trap the creature.\u201d The Seventh Elder\u2019s face changed. He could tell that the leader\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t sound right.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help you with that, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Han Sen can make a few more deifieds to balance out Han Yan\u2019s acquisition of the skill, but I can\u2019t lend you aid at the same time. You should think of a way. It\u2019s your idea; don\u2019t you think you can do it? You are eligible for a grand reward if you do.\u201d \u201cThis\u2026\u201d Seventh Elder\u2019s face was turning green. Yun Changkong felt relief flow through him. Sky Palace Leader was protecting Han Yan. Many of the elders and officers who had wanted to take the jade sword by force had suddenly stopped talking.\n\nSky Palace Leader wanted to protect Han Yan. And with Han Sen\u2019s reputation as well, none of them were bold enough to try to get the jade sword by themselves.By doing so, they would be disobeying the leader\u2019s orders and disrespecting Han Sen at the same time. Han Sen would likely never bless them if that occurred. Plus, Han Sen had two true god weapons, and he had drawn the attention of the Very High. He would only continue to gain power as time went by. If they stole things from Han Yan now, they\u2019d be making an enemy of Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI will support whoever gets the sword skill back. If you can truly claim it, then I will reward you handsomely,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said while looking at everybody. No one chose to speak.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think the matter would be resolved so easily. The people of Sky Palace wouldn\u2019t let such an important sword skill land in Han Yan\u2019s hands.\n\nBut what he expected didn\u2019t come to pass. Sky Palace didn\u2019t come up with an excuse to take the Eleventh Leader\u2019s sword skill for themselves. But Yun Changkong also didn\u2019t take Han Yan as a student. Instead, he asked his teacher to be her teacher; in effect, he made Han Yan his little sister. That was another way of saying that she was on the same level as Sky Palace Leader.\n\nAfter the teacher ceremony, Han Yan\u2019s standing in Sky Palace became obscenely high despite her young age. Even Lone Bamboo, when he saw her, would have to refer to her respectfully.\n\nHan Yan had picked holy gourds, received the legendary sword skill, and become a fellow student with Yun Changkong. She instantly became a legend all across Sky Palace. Her reputation exceeded even Lone Bamboo\u2019s. Everyone knew Han Sen had an awesome sister.\n\nOf course, what most students were fond of was her appearance.\n\nMany students had discussed the subject of Han Sen potentially blessing her. Perhaps that was why she was so strong at such a young age. That made them want Han Sen\u2019s blessing even more."
