    "text": "As he left Night Charm Town, Han Sen got to thinking about the exam.\n\nThe exam gauged the power of the royal children. Some of the tests would judge the royal children\u2019s leadership potential and their collective power when placed in groups. Their guards were allowed to join them.\n\nBut other tests focused on the individual power of the royal children. Only the royal children could participate in those.\n\nOne of the activities, for example, involved hiking up Bone Mountain and reaching its peak.\n\nBone Mountain was one of the three famous mountains in King\u2019s Kingdom. It wasn\u2019t as dangerous as Extreme Mountain, but that didn\u2019t mean reaching its peak would be easy. Its slopes were quite treacherous.\n\nHiking up Bone Mountain was a trial that showcased power, courage, and endurance.\n\nThe mountain was commonly called Rot Bone Mountain. The environment was highly toxic, and when people were too stubborn to abandon their attempts to climb the mountain, the toxicity would corrode them until their bodies were gone. Only their proud skulls were left behind.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been to Rot Bone Mountain before, so he wasn\u2019t sure what sort of power he would have to contend with. He knew that it could destroy courage and endurance, and make proud creatures lower their heads.\n\nBut Bai Ling Shuang mentioned that if royal children possessed the Kingese Ao or Ju, they were sure to have a higher chance of reaching the peak.\n\nHan Sen had received loads of Kingese protection, including Ao and Ju. The chance of him reaching the top of Rot Bone Mountain was high, so Bai Ling Shuang was willing to pay a high price for his help.\n\nBai Ling Shuang wanted to go to Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s peak, not for King Bai\u2019s compliments, but for the benefits Rot Bone Mountain could provide. Those rewards could only be claimed by reaching the summit of that place.\n\nIn regards to the exact nature of what she hoped to gain, Bai Ling Shuang didn\u2019t elaborate, and Han Sen didn\u2019t ask.\n\n\u201cWhat is atop Rot Bone Mountain\u2019s peak?\u201d As Han Sen wondered about this, his phone started to ring.\n\nHe looked at the number calling him and noticed that it was listed as \u201cunknown.\u201d He had disguised himself as Bai Yi, but he had kept his old phone number. He had been careful not to contact anyone on Planet Eclipse, though, in case the Extreme King screened the calls and picked up on something.\n\nNow, suddenly, a strange number was calling him, which was confusing. He hesitated, but he still answered the call. He was curious.\n\nA beautiful woman with long, black hair appeared on his screen. Her face looked divine, and her emerald eyes were captivating. Her boobs were small, but everything else was great.\n\nHan Sen looked at the woman in the video. She wasn\u2019t the most beautiful woman he\u2019d seen, but he would rate her at a fine nine-out-of-ten. Still, he didn\u2019t remember ever seeing her before.\n\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Han Sen looked at the woman, and he noticed her reserved expression. The longer he looked at her, the more familiar she seemed. He just couldn\u2019t remember where they might have met.\n\n\u201cI am Ning Yue. Can you talk?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was very clear, but her words shocked Han Sen. His eyes opened wide, and his mouth gaped.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been able to place his sense of familiarity with the woman. Hearing the name Ning Yue, however, made him feel like he\u2019d been tased. Now he knew where that familiar feeling came from.\n\nAside from having a female body, the woman appeared and behaved just like Ning Yue. If not for the emerald eyes that had captured his gaze, Han Sen probably would have guessed who it was eventually.\n\nEven so, Han Sen was still left speechless.\n\n\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d Han Sen ended the call and went to his computer. He logged in and called the number back.\n\nThe call rang through, and the image of that beautiful woman appeared on Han Sen\u2019s computer.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen held his laughter at bay. He didn\u2019t think anyone could disguise themselves as Ning Yue.\n\nNing Yue was a very special person, so masquerading as him would be difficult. But even if someone went to the trouble to steal another person\u2019s identity, why would they choose Ning Yue? He wasn\u2019t famous or important in the geno universe, so what was the point?\n\nNot to mention that, even if there was something benefit to be gained, no one could make a woman disguise themselves as Ning Yue. This was too much.\n\nSeeing Han Sen attempting to hold back his laughter, Ning Yue\u2019s eyes twitched. In an emotionless tone, he began to explain what had happened.\n\nNing Yue had been captured by the Hell, and he was forced into slavery in a secret Hell xenogeneic space. During his incarceration, a strange woman appeared out of a black rock. She killed all of the Hell and the slaves without discrimination.\n\nNing Yue had gotten his hands on a little green sword during the chaos, and he used it to kill Hell King and the woman from the rock. After killing them, Ning Yue discovered that Hell King and the woman were both deified elites, not half-deified as he had assumed. This shocked Ning Yue. He didn\u2019t understand how the little green sword had wielded so much power.\n\nNing Yue only had the power of a Marquise. Even if he held a deified weapon, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to kill a deified xenogeneic. But the little green sword had decapitated two deified xenogeneics with ease.\n\nThey had been injured, of course, so that was worth considering. But the little green sword\u2019s power was still mind-boggling.\n\n\u201cYou say you used the green sword to kill two deified xenogeneics?\u201d Han Sen stared at Ning Yue, unable to believe his ears.\n\nEven if Han Sen used the Thunder God Spike, he couldn\u2019t damage deified xenogeneics. Ning Yue was just a Marquise. The feat he had achieved with the little green sword was a bit unbelievable.\n\n\u201cYes. And I received a deified beast soul,\u201d Ning Yue pulled the little green sword out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a deified beast soul? You won big!\u201d After Han Sen\u2019s shock subsided, he examined Ning Yue\u2019s little sword. The blade was two fingers wide. It was an intriguing shade of dark green, but other than the color, nothing about the sword seemed very special. There were no engravings on the blade, and it didn\u2019t even have a scabbard to go with it.\n\n\u201cI would rather not have earned it,\u201d Ning Yue said grimly. He flipped the green sword over to reveal its other side to Han Sen. There was a green mark on it, as if some liquid had stained its surface.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It won\u2019t go away.\u201d Ning Yue paused and then went on to say, \u201cAfter I killed the two deifieds, their bodies became liquid, then disappeared. Nothing remained. Not even a xenogeneic gene.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard this, he furrowed his brows, and his expression turned suddenly serious.\n\nWith deified xenogeneics, their entire bodies were their xenogeneic genes. Melting one shouldn\u2019t have been possible. It had to be related to the green sword.\n\n\u201cI left the xenogeneic space. The first time I went to sleep, I woke up looking like this.\u201d Ning Yue sighed.\n\n\u201cYou, uh\u2026 Did you lose\u2026\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cNo, my manhood is still here. But some parts of me look woman-like.\u201d A muscle in Ning Yue\u2019s cheek spasmed."
