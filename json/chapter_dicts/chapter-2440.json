    "text": "Wan\u2019er was still in her comatose state, but Han Sen tossed her body away from him. She landed against the ground some distance away, but luckily, Han Sen had used some of his power to cushion her landing. Instead of slamming into the ground like a bag of rocks, Wan\u2019er slid smoothly through the air and landed softly, almost silently, on the ground.\n\nHan Sen wanted to see if having some distance between himself and Wan\u2019er would allow him to fully activate and maintain his super god spirit body.\n\nAfter tossing Wan\u2019er aside, Han Sen redeployed his super god spirit body. White light surrounded him once again, glowing from his hair and eyes.\n\nHis red eyes vanished in a sea of white, just like they had on his previous attempt. But this time, Han Sen managed to keep his super god spirit body going, and his power didn\u2019t fade.\n\n\u201cWas Wan\u2019er really causing my power to disappear? What\u2019s going on? How is it possible for her to affect my super god spirit body?\u201d Han Sen looked at Wan\u2019er with shock. He noticed that her own body was glowing with gold light. Her eyes and hair were turning gold.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t have time to worry about that at the moment, though. He just focused on using Super Spank. He threw his fist toward the eye on the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes to see if he could break it.\n\nBut the moment Han Sen got close, a weird glow rose around the statue. The statue seemed to be gathering up a substance chain of red light, and then the light lashed out at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s super god spirit body ignored blood light coming for him. The blood light went straight through him like he didn\u2019t even exist. Like he was some sort of phantom.\n\nBut Han Sen punched the statue\u2019s eye, releasing an explosion of force. The shockwave shoved Han Sen\u2019s body back, but the Super Spank strike was unable to destroy the eye.\n\n\u201cThis is harder than that weird deified bug.\u201d Even the thought made Han Sen feel a cold dread. Part of him had expected this result, though. The confirmation simply disappointed him.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t break the statue. That meant he couldn\u2019t unlock the secrets of the red-eye power. But it also wouldn\u2019t affect him because he had the super god spirit body. But if anyone else was infected with the red-eye condition, there was nothing he could do.\n\nHan Sen turned around and began walking away. He needed to leave the broken city, first and foremost. But then, the statue suddenly moved. Its enormous form suddenly stood fully erect, and it looked down on Han Sen with abject hatred. The entire hall shook as the statue rose to its full height.\n\n\u201cIt is alive!\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t surprised. He jumped forward and tried to reach Wan\u2019er.\n\nBut he then saw Wan\u2019er\u2019s body lift itself off the ground. Her hair and eyes had turned blonde, and she now looked exactly as she had appeared when Han Sen first saw her.\n\nHer eyes were open, but they were glazed and unfocused.\n\nThe statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes stepped forward, sending one of its demon-like hands down to slap Han Sen. It paused above him, though, and it began to shine.\n\nThe blonde-haired Wan\u2019er teleported in front of the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes, hovering in the air directly in front of its face. She waved her hand and cut its head off.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe giant stone head fell onto the floor of the hall, creating a good-sized crater where it slammed into the floor.\n\nHan Sen was frozen. Wan\u2019er had such a weak body, but after she turned golden, her power became truly frightening. Its magnitude was difficult to believe.\n\nThis was completely different from what the sixth image of the mural had depicted, too. The sixth picture showed one person on the floor and another person praying to the complete statue.\n\nBut while the head had been cut off, the statue of a thousand hands and a thousand eyes did not fall. Its body began to writhe, and all of its one thousand arms were moving. The red eye in each of its hands began to glow, and that hellish glow covered the hall from one end to the other. Countless red substance chains emerged and slithered toward Wan\u2019er\u2019s body.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s power was incredible, but her body was solid and could therefore be injured. She didn\u2019t have the invincible features of Han Sen\u2019s super god spirit body.\n\nCountless substance chains tangled around Wan\u2019er\u2019s body, and a cruel grin suddenly played across the mouth of the statue head on the floor. It flew up and opened its mouth, trying to consume Wan\u2019er.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart leaped. He stepped forward to help Wan\u2019er, but the golden light coming from Wan\u2019er\u2019s body intensified, and the rest of the chains suddenly melted. She raised a single hand and pressed it against the statue\u2019s head, and then, the statue\u2019s head exploded like fireworks.\n\nThe head was shattered, but the statue wasn\u2019t dead. It seemed to be quite shocked, though. It turned its giant body around to run away.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s blonde-haired form flashed, and she reappeared beside the statue. She reached out and planted her hands firmly on the statue\u2019s body.\n\nPang!\n\nThe whole statue exploded. The giant body was reduced to a heap of rubble, and its arms lay scattered about.\n\n\u201cToo strong!\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but compliment her display of power. Strength like that could destroy almost anything. Even that powerful statue had been killed in scant moments.\n\nMost of the arms that fell to the floor of the hall were now broken, and the eyes that they held had been destroyed. Even those that hadn\u2019t been outright destroyed were bleeding profusely. They would die soon. The arms writhed on the floor in a sickening fashion, like deadly snakes.\n\nBut one broken eyeball did shoot away from its attendant hand. It became a blood light as it tried to escape the hall.\n\nHan Sen stood next to the exit of the hall, and he watched that blood eye come. He used Super Spank to smack it. There was a loud squelching noise as he smacked it, and the jelly of the eyeball sprayed out as the thing fell to the floor.\n\nWhen the eyeball ruptured, the writhing pieces of the statue all stopped. It was like a heap of rubble now, and nothing more.\n\n\u201cMutant Deified Xenogeneic hunted: Blood Eye Evil God. Mutant xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Blood Eye Evil God beast soul.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard the announcement, he was shocked. He hadn\u2019t even realized what he was about to do when he struck the eyeball. He just didn\u2019t want it to escape. He hadn\u2019t thought there\u2019d be a reward, especially a reward on such a scale.\n\nBefore Han Sen had time to examine the Blood Eye Evil God\u2019s beast soul, the blonde-haired Wan\u2019er teleported over to him. Her golden eyes looked in Han Sen\u2019s direction, but they had so little focus that he couldn\u2019t tell if she was actually looking at him.\n\nThen Wan\u2019er\u2019s hand drifted forward to pat Han Sen on the head. This shocked Han Sen. He suddenly realized that when Wan\u2019er had grabbed his neck, she had wanted to kill him. But something else had happened instead.\n\nAs Wan\u2019er\u2019s hand came from, an overwhelming sense of danger weighed on Han Sen\u2019s shoulders. The feeling was so strong it was almost suffocating."
