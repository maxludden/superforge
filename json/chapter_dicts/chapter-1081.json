The crystals were firmly lodged in his body and had become a part of him. The demi-gods were strong, and even though they could have broken the crystals, destroying them would mean destroying the organs. And destroying the organs would mean killing Han Sen.\n\nA few days later, a middle-aged man came to see Han Sen with Ji Yanwu.\n\nJi Yanwu, from what Han Sen could immediately see, respected the man he had brought with him a great deal. And although he didn\u2019t say a word, Han Sen could tell who this person was.\n\nIt was Luo Haitang, the Godslayer.\n\nAfter Luo Haitang examined Han Sen, all he did was sigh and leave. He never returned after that.\n\nMany people came to know about Han Sen\u2019s poor condition. Although the specifics weren\u2019t widespread, it was common to hear people whisper about Han Sen having suffered an unfortunate accident. The wounds Han Sen had incurred were so grievous, not even the legendary Godslayer could fix them.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t in any danger of dying, and his condition wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal had he been an ordinary person, but Han Sen was Han Sen. And without his powers, Han Sen was useless. He felt useless.\n\nMany people came to visit. Some came kindheartedly, to see if they could do anything or, at the very least, express their condolences. Others just came to see if what they had heard was true: the great Han Sen had fallen.\n\nNo matter what they thought though, Han Sen did not give in to sadness. He wasn\u2019t going to abandon hope of recovery because he had a solution of his own.\n\nHe might not have been able to open his gene locks, but he could still make use of his super king spirit mode. With that, he himself could remove the crystals slowly over time.\n\nBecause the crystals were a part of Han Sen, they had to be removed bit-by-bit, slowly. It would take a long time for this crystallization process to be reversed; a very long time.\n\nHan Sen actually had another method of fixing himself, and that was to use the demon language he had learned while in Devil\u2019s Realm. If he spoke it, he could heal and improve his body quickly.\n\nBut of course, Han Sen still preferred to get rid of it the slow way. He wasn\u2019t going to immediately fix himself, if doing so allowed the light to change him.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d The Zhao family feigned sadness over the entire affair. But obviously, behind the scenes, they mocked Han Sen.\n\nThe Zhao family and Han Sen had much bad blood between them, so it was only natural for them to feel this way. Their history was an ugly one, after all.\n\nThe people who were genuinely close to Han Sen, though, who believed he could not recover, were incredibly upset over what had occurred.\n\n\u201cHandsome.\u201d Wang Mengmeng and Wang Yuhang came to visit Han Sen one day, and when they looked at Han Sen, they did so with red eyes. Evidently, they had been crying their eyes out upon learning of his condition.\n\nQin Lan, Yang Manli, Tang Zhenliu, Lin Feng, Lin Beifeng, Su Xiaoqiao, Liu Meng, and Huangfu Pingqing all came to visit him, over time. Even Ning Yue came to visit.\n\nNing Yue did not say much, given the circumstances, but before he left, he said, \u201cRecover soon, yes? Without an opponent as formidable as you up and about, this world seems rather dull already.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and responded, \u201cYou can always buy me a drink sometime.\u201d\n\nQueen also came to visit Han Sen. She didn\u2019t stay long, though. All she did was slap Han Sen\u2019s forehead and swiftly leave.\n\nEven Han Sen was confused by this behavior, and after she left, he nursed his forehead and mulled why she had acted that way.\n\nMany more people came to visit Han Sen, and it warmed his heart far more than he thought it would. He was delighted to learn he had so many friends who genuinely cared for his wellbeing.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mother, Luo Lan, did not sound worried at all, though, upon learning of his affliction. She even had the gall to say, \u201cPerhaps this means you can stay at home and make some babies for me. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for a grandson.\u201d\n\nHan Sen could only present her a wry smile after this, not fancying himself as a baby-making machine.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you need to work?\u201d Han Sen asked Ji Yanran, who came to visit and was peeling an apple for him.\n\nEver since what happened, Ji Yanran had practically moved into the Han household to look after him.\n\n\u201cI retired,\u201d Ji Yanran said.\n\nHan Sen was shocked to hear this, and said, \u201cI thought you wanted to be a captain! There\u2019s no need for you to worry about me.\u201d\n\nJi Yanran looked at him and said, \u201cYou owe me a wedding. You still owe me a proper proposal. Have you forgotten about how terrible your first was?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cGive it to me now.\u201d Ji Yanran demanded.\n\n\u201cBut now I\u2026\u201d Han Sen wanted to say he was planning to give her a better one, once he was healed.\n\n\u201cYou need someone beside you 24/7, and I want that person to be me.\u201d Ji Yanran was firm in this stance.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want Ji Yanran to waste her life and career by nursing him.\n\n\u201cYou owe me. And besides, the psychic said if I don\u2019t marry this year, it\u2019s best I wait another ten years. And I don\u2019t want to wait ten years before I get married!\u201d Ji Yanran pleaded.\n\n\u201cYanran\u2026\u201d Han Sen held her, thinking her kindness to be immeasurable. He was so touched, he felt he\u2019d have to spend his entire life trying to repay her sacrifices just to be with him.\n\nHan Sen proposed and they got married. The wedding ceremony was simple, held between close family members and friends. Once it was done, they became husband and wife.\n\nAfter their wedding, Ji Yanran opened an aircraft company on Planet Roca. Han Sen spent his time researching hyper geno arts.\n\nHe could not practice hyper geno arts at this time, so all he could do was research them. Bai Yishan taught him much, but he also spent time studying ancient languages to help him practice the Dongxuan Sutra in the future, amongst other things.\n\nHan Sen confirmed what he wished to research, opting not to learn about the more famous hyper geno arts or the hyper geno arts that were applied to the use of weapons.\n\nHe researched the powers of the Coin Toad. He wanted to make it a hyper geno art.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to just make it any hyper geno art, as it currently was. He wanted to make the low tier coins even more powerful, so they could match with high tier gene locks."
