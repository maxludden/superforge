He stopped dodging and simply activated his super king spirit mode.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen punched the monkey king with tremendous force, which knocked it backwards into a roll. Unexpectedly, it landed perfectly. The strike had hit the monkey\u2019s fist, and the only damage the strike did was to cause the creature\u2019s hand to bruise and swell.\n\nThis was an unpleasant surprise. His super king spirit mode had opened its first gene lock, but his fitness level was much higher than a sacred-blood creature\u2019s. For the monkey king to be nearly unfazed by Han Sen\u2019s strike, he couldn\u2019t imagine how many gene locks of its own it had opened.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s super king spirit mode was always on a short fuse. If he stood a chance, he couldn\u2019t waste a single second. He had to take his opponent out before the timer expired. But weirdly, the monkey king was starting to run off again, and Han Sen was unable to catch up.\n\n\u201cHow many gene locks has this guy opened?\u201d Han Sen deactivated his super king spirit mode.\n\nHan Sen knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with the ape, so he thought it best if he saved some strength.\n\nThe monkey king looked scared of Han Sen, surprisingly. It stopped, then simply watched him from afar.\n\nThe monkey king commanded the other monkeys to follow it, which made them back away from Han Sen. The worst they did was give a mean stare to the intruders of the valley, as they heeded their king\u2019s order.\n\nIt was fortunate for Han Sen that the monkey king was somewhat of a wimp. Being unable to beat the monkey king with his ten seconds of super king spirit mode would have left Han Sen in a dire predicament.\n\nWith the valley now mostly clear of monkeys, Han Sen decided to explore the area a bit. The only things of note there, aside from the trees, were the oversized dishes and cooking implements. None of them were particularly special or fancy in appearance, and they looked fairly practical and crude. Whatever they were, they were made by hand, that was for sure.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to spare too much time thinking about those items right now, though. After the fight, he noticed he was feeling rather hungry. He ate some of the red fruits Bao\u2019er had consumed, to fill his empty tummy. They tasted sweet and refreshing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder she loves these things. They taste much better than the seedless fruit you can buy back in the Alliance.\u201d Han Sen ate a whole fruit.\n\n\u201cSuper King Self Spirit Gene +1.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked, learning that a single one of those fruits could provide one self geno point.\n\nYaksha had only managed to grow one Devil King Tree, the fruit of which also provided one self geno point.\n\n\u201cIs it possible that all these trees can be as bountiful as the Devil King Tree\u2019s fruit?\u201d Han Sen, not sparing any time, raced to grab another fruit.\n\n\u201cSuper King Self Spirit Gene +1.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen ate the next, he heard the same announcement. He had rarely been this happy.\n\n\u201cWhat about this fruit here? Can they provide the same?\u201d Han Sen picked up a yellow fruit, which he had seen a few monkeys consume earlier.\n\nWhen Han Sen ate this fruit, he heard the announcement play again. He was giddy like a schoolgirl.\n\n\u201cIf I eat them all, how many self geno points might I receive in total? I\u2019d wager a fraction of this valley would be enough to cap off my self geno point needs!\u201d Han Sen, reveling in excitement, began munching all the fruit he could.\n\nUnfortunately for him, he was not a super creature and his belly had a limit. After ten of the fruit, he was stuffed and could eat no more.\n\nWhat disappointed Han Sen the most, though, was that after eating three of the red fruits, his points did not increase any more. It seemed as if by consuming the same fruit three times, and by receiving a self geno point each time, he couldn\u2019t get any more.\n\n\u201cStill, there\u2019s a wide variety of fruit here in the valley. Even if I took three from each, I could still earn myself a few hundred geno points.\u201d Han Sen was not at all disappointed, as there was still plenty to get.\n\nAfter Han Sen was full, he decided to look around for a way in which he might exit the area. The sides of the valley were tall and steep, and the sky was blocked by an invisible force. He had been trapped.\n\nThe monkey king and the monkeys were still in the region, but they did not dare provoke him. In fact, it seemed as if the monkeys themselves were looking for an exit, as well.\n\nAfter the monkeys had eaten the fruit, their bodies seemed to morph and become stronger. Even the mangy, lanky monkeys were starting to buff-up and look similar to the king.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face became dire when he noticed this. What\u2019s more, it seemed the monkey king had only just found this place instead of living there, as Han Sen had initially suspected. If they did not know how to leave, then he was stuck there with them.\n\nAnd by further observation of their behavior, his suspicions were confirmed.\n\nThe monkeys had gotten bigger. They weren\u2019t king-sized yet, but it was clear they had opened a few gene locks.\n\nHan Sen made sure to eat as much fruit as he could, whenever space was reclaimed inside his stomach. Before long, he had reached the third tier of super king spirit mode.\n\nHis power had not greatly increased, but there was an improvement to the length of the talent.\n\nHan Sen summoned his Disloyal Knight, Meowth, and Golden Growler, and got them to dine on what they could. Following their consumption of the fruit, they each experienced some changes.\n\nAfter this, though, Han Sen was determined to find a way out. There had to be a way to escape the valley, he just had to find it. But the mystic force that shielded the place proved to be too formidable, and it protected the land there. Han Sen could not even create a cleft in a rock with a mighty strike.\n\nHan Sen realized time itself was rather stiff in the valley, too. It felt as if time was standing still there.\n\nThe trees had stopped growing. The ripe fruit did not fall to the ground, and the unripened fruit stayed as they were.\n\n\u201cThis valley is a strange place.\u201d Han Sen was a little bewildered by the place he had found himself. But it seemed that, until the cave revealed itself again, he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nHe also realized he couldn\u2019t get in touch with Moment Queen. It was as if such connections were interrupted by the powers of the valley, isolating him."
