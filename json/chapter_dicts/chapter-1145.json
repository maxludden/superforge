How dare you show your face to me.\u201d Yaksha looked incredibly angry, seeing Han Sen approach in an attempt to stop him.\n\nHan Sen summoned Disloyal Knight. The gold raven was still evolving, so he knew he couldn\u2019t personally put up much of a fight without it. The last time he fought Yaksha, he had only just woken up. Now, he could be much stronger.\n\nDisloyal Knight cast his halo and threw a punch towards Yaksha.\n\nYaksha did not evade, though. He fearlessly went forward to meet with Disloyal Knight and threw a punch of his own. When the two fists collided with each other, they generated a massive shockwave.\n\nBut even though the halo had worked its magic, Yaksha was still stronger than Disloyal Knight. He was the victor in that first strike, hurling Disloyal Knight backwards.\n\nYaksha\u2019s face changed, and he said, \u201cA halo super beast soul?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was dismayed, seeing the effects not weakening Yaksha as much as he had hoped. It had worked on him, but not to the point that he could not fight back. This meant Yaksha had to be close to opening his tenth gene lock.\n\n\u201cYaksha, I knew I should have come looking for you. But today, you have delivered yourself to me, so there\u2019s no foul. Come here, let me kill you.\u201d Han Sen just wanted to infuriate Yaksha, which was a simple enough task.\n\nYaksha knew this, but he complied anyway and said, \u201cIf you want to die that much, I\u2019ll grant you your wish.\u201d\n\nYaksha leapt forward, but this time, it was towards Xiang Yin. That was his reason for being in this place, after all. Stopping her was his number one priority.\n\nHan Sen commanded Disloyal Knight to charge forth and stop him, but he was very slow compared to Yaksha. Han Sen knew he\u2019d have to chip in, so he drew his Taia and Phoenix Sword. Wearing his mantis armor and dragon wings, he flew forward.\n\nYaksha had been weakened by the halo, so with the phoenix techniques of flight Han Sen had learned, he was able to catch up. Han Sen would not use his super king spirit body unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nHis fitness was still not up to par with a king spirit. If he wanted to be a match for Yaksha, he\u2019d need another thousand fitness levels. But it was Disloyal Knight\u2019s halo that evened the odds.\n\nYaksha saw Han Sen fly before him to prevent his passage, so he threw a punch and said, \u201cUse your creepy skill. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be able to fight me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to use that to kill a pathetic, little king spirit like you? Pah! You\u2019re only worthy of my bottom-shelf skills.\u201d Han Sen, with his phoenix techniques, dodged the incoming strike and retaliated with his own.\n\nYaksha believed Han Sen\u2019s movements were strange, so he said, \u201cAgainst my speed, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be killed before you even know what hits you. It must be sad to know you\u2019ll die without even knowing how.\u201d\n\nYaksha sped up once more. His weakened body was managing to move even faster now, and when Han Sen next saw him, his lecherous fingers were reaching forth to strike Han Sen\u2019s eyes.\n\nHe evaded the fingers by an inch, but not without his helmet being scratched.\n\nHan Sen felt the marks that had been delivered and his face changed. Only Yaksha\u2019s nails had scratched his helmet, but even so, they had almost broken his super armor.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for his phoenix techniques, the scratches would have gone through and shredded his head like a rotting melon.\n\nYaksha wasn\u2019t looking to waste time with the distraction that was Han Sen, though. He moved forward with the haste of a near-teleportation level of speed and grabbed Han Sen.\n\nA red mist then began to envelop Han Sen as he opened the ninth gene lock of the Blood-Pulse Sutra. The red mist dyed his armor and weaponry a creepy crimson color.\n\nHe cast Heresy Mantra, as well. The refined and purified blood began pumping and coursing through his body.\n\nHis kidney produced a large amount of energy to fuel all this and keep Han Sen going in the struggle.\n\nBut still, it didn\u2019t prove enough to keep up with Yaksha. His chest was cut up, and the lacerations began to bleed. It was quite terrifying to see himself be delivered such wounds, despite wearing such sturdy armor.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder he is one of the generals. He must definitely be as strong as Xiang Yin.\u201d Han Sen flapped his wings, slipped Yaksha\u2019s grasp, and flew forward to catch up with him. Then, he cast Dual Blade.\n\nYaksha\u2019s attack had not severely damaged Han Sen. Killing Han Sen would be a trivial task for him, but he knew he had to stop Xiang Yin\u2019s ascension first.\n\nDisloyal Knight finally caught up and punched Yaksha in the back. This was all Han Sen needed to keep doing, to slow him down. With Disloyal Knight there, keeping him occupied would be far easier.\n\nYaksha, feeling something else come towards him from behind, turned to look. There, he saw Han Sen racing towards him, prompting him to spread his wings.\n\nAnd the moment Yaksha spread those wings, his speed became unfathomably quick.\n\nPang!\n\nDisloyal Knight\u2019s fist could not catch up, and Han Sen could only see a blurry shadow speed away from him. But then, a Han Sen received a hit to his chest, which sent him flying away.\n\nHan Sen was thrown through a rock, splitting it. On his chest were five bloody holes\u2014his heart had almost been ripped out.\n\n\u201cYou should be proud of yourself, for that strike not to have killed you. Now, go away!\u201d Yaksha mockingly stated before turning around to resume his flight towards Xiang Yin. He did not want her to take that last step."
