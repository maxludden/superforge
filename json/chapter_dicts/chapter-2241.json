    "text": "Ice Blue Knight King reached his hand out and pulled Han Sen\u2019s frozen form through the sky toward him.\n\nSeeing that Han Sen was about to get sucked into Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s hands, the previously-frozen Bao\u2019er suddenly moved. She pounded the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum repeatedly.\n\nA shockwave shot out to batter Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s head. They were at extremely close range, and Ice Blue Knight King had relaxed his defenses. The Knight King\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, though. His body flashed blue and deflected the sonic forces that came against him.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw the acoustic force of the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum fail to make a dent, he immediately flapped his wings to get the hell out of there. He cast Jadeskin first, then made use of Break Space Flash.\n\nOther powers might have been able to trap Han Sen, but luckily, the Knight King had attempted to trap him with cold. A power like that didn\u2019t stand a chance of holding Han Sen against his will.\n\nHe had spent a long time practicing Jadeskin near that jade toad. Even deified cold powers couldn\u2019t harm Han Sen in the least. Ice Blue Knight King had a fierce cold power, but he wasn\u2019t in the same league as the jade toad. He was unable to trap Han Sen in that wintery grip.\n\nHan Sen had planned to slip away from the Knight King after Bao\u2019er dazed him, but he hadn\u2019t expected the sonic forces to fail when employed at such a close distance.\n\nIce Blue Knight King looked very surprised that a Marquise was able to block his Ice Blue powers, though. That was completely unexpected.\n\nHan Sen kept teleporting, but Break Space Flash came from the dragon wing gene. He didn\u2019t have the ability himself, so there were limits to his use of the skill. He would show up somewhere and then teleport away again. Even so, he was incredibly fast. Ordinary Dukes couldn\u2019t keep up with Han Sen if they were moving at full speed, that much was certain. But against someone like Ice Blue Knight King, that speed wasn\u2019t enough to maintain a lead.\n\nIce Blue Knight King smiled. \u201cYou truly are Knife\u2019s student. You can escape my Ice Blue power. In that case, try to repel my Deep Blue Abyss.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Ice Blue Knight King moved. The Ice Blue colors suddenly deepened to a navy blue. It was like a demon that could swallow the earth was now coming for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen kept teleporting around, but he still couldn\u2019t escape that rapidly approaching navy blue color. As he rose high into the air, the power condensed into a navy blue crystal around him.\n\nIce Blue Knight King moved slowly toward the frozen Han Sen. \u201cFor Knife\u2019s sake, I won\u2019t kill you. But you will have to hand the item over. If you give it back, then I will pretend nothing happened. And the reward you are owed will still be yours to claim.\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King moved close enough to touch the blue crystal. Just as he reached out his hand, however, his face warped.\n\nA jade power was spreading inside that blue crystal, and the crystal itself was starting to crack.\n\nIce Blue Knight King was shocked. His blue powers weren\u2019t just cold powers; they also had sealing effects. But it looked like even those powers couldn\u2019t trap Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was running Jadeskin at full strength. His Jadeskin had been on the verge of becoming Duke, and under the pressure of the Deep Blue power, it finally achieved the breakthrough it needed.\n\nJadeskin power spread all across Han Sen\u2019s body. His flesh had been red because of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, but it suddenly changed to look like ocean ice. Han Sen\u2019s entire body seemed like it had been made from crystal.\n\nIt was so pure and elegant; he didn\u2019t look human at all.\n\nThe angelic power he received from Little Angel had imbued Han Sen with a pure energy. It changed along with Han Sen\u2019s breakthrough and was transferred into Jadeskin energy. It pushed Han Sen\u2019s body to become Duke.\n\nMarquises could develop skills for the element they were associated with. When they became Dukes, those skills would change. Dukes combined more completely with their element, which allowed them to use it more fully.\n\nThat pure element touched the edge of the rule. It wasn\u2019t quite like the power of a King, which could be used to directly affect an enemy without the activation of a skill. It did, however, provide a nice power increase.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what element Jadeskin belonged to. It might have possessed some icy powers, but it wasn\u2019t completely ice-bound.\n\nBoom!\n\nDefying the sealing powers placed on him, Han Sen moved. The blue crystal that had trapped him cracked. Han Sen flapped his wings and teleported again. This time, he did so much faster.\n\nIce Blue Knight King was stunned. He waved his hand and sent more of that Deep Blue power after Han Sen. The Knight King tried to drown Han Sen with it as he attempted to flee.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen was rushing out of the blue. He shrugged off the sealing powers without difficulty.\n\n\u201cIce Blue Knight King\u2019s Deep Blue power was unable to seal him. It looks like his elemental associations are strong, and he has a high resistance to sealing powers.\u201d Edward\u2019s gaze was disturbingly intense.\n\nWhen Han Sen was trapped by the Deep Blue power, Edward had planned to help Han Sen escape.\n\nBut Han Sen had managed to get out by himself before Edward could take action. Han Sen had broken Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s Deep Blue power using his own strength.\n\n\u201cIce Blue Knight King has struck twice now, and still, he hasn\u2019t been able to stop Han Sen. No wonder Night River King failed to kill this maniac. You are right. He is a scary guy!\u201d The Ice Blue Knight seemed unsettled.\n\nThe Knight King continued his attack, but Han Sen kept sliding out from under that Deep Blue Abyss. The Deep Blue powers couldn\u2019t stop him.\n\nHan Sen felt as if his body had been crystallized. He couldn\u2019t release any energy, but the powers launched against him couldn\u2019t penetrate his body, either.\n\nIt felt very weird, and it reminded him of a time before he started practicing geno arts. He could only use his own physical strength, and he was unable to unleash energy.\n\nBut his body was stronger than ever; that much was certain. It gave him the illusion that he could break everything in front of him with his raw strength.\n\nIce Blue Knight King, watching Han Sen slide effortlessly out from under the Deep Blue Abyss, felt powerless and frustrated. He moved forward to catch up with Han Sen, gathering a frightening power as he went.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just an icy sealing power. This one possessed great destructive strength. Ice Blue Knight King looked serious, and Han Sen could see in his eyes that he had given up on the prospect of simply sealing him.\n\nDong!\n\nIce Blue Knight King\u2019s power came slashing down on Han Sen, but a ghostly shield suddenly appeared to block his attack.\n\nIt was Han Sen\u2019s only undamaged Demon Bug King Bai Sema: the one he had taken from Han Yan."
