    "text": "\u201cMy good little brother, are you really that naive? Surely you don\u2019t think that the blood kirin\u2019s power is sufficient to challenge someone like me?\u201d Fox Queen smiled at Han Sen and the blood kirin as she stood before the mountain.\n\n\u201cBig sis, you\u2019re far too suspicious. Have you forgotten about the close bond between us? Why would I ever want to attack my big sister? When I realized that you\u2019d been freed, I wanted to come and celebrate the occasion with you. I just thought I would bring along the blood kirin,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve come here to celebrate with your big sister, you should have brought her a gift, isn\u2019t that correct? Otherwise, your big sister would be made rather angry,\u201d Fox Queen said, maintaining her smarmy smile.\n\nHan Sen knew what gift Fox Queen was referring to. He moved without hesitation, pulling out the item and holding it up. \u201cOf course, this is your big day! As a little brother, I want to give you the best gift I can.\u201d\n\nFox Queen looked at the item in Han Sen\u2019s hand, and then she looked at Mister White and asked, \u201cWhat do you guys think of the gift my little brother is offering?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no idea. Only Edward knew what the item was,\u201d Mister White confessed, looking slightly ill.\n\nFox Queen held out her hand, and Han Sen placed the item in her palm. Fox Queen looked at the crystal tablet carefully, but there did not appear to be anything special about it.\n\n\u201cIs this really the item you retrieved from Ghost Bone Town?\u201d Fox Queen directed a piercing stare at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Han Sen assured her.\n\nFox Queen gave Mister White the stone tablet. \u201cMister White, what do you make of it?\u201d\n\nAfter a brief moment of thought, Mister White said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly is special about this item, but I can tell you that it is very old. It must be truly ancient, in fact. Its age alone makes it interesting.\u201d\n\nMister White was making it clear to Fox Queen that he didn\u2019t know if the tablet was the same item that Han Sen had taken from Ghost Bone Town. It was too old to be a forgery, though.\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \u201cOf course it is old. I went back to the Alliance and took it from a crystallizer ruin.\u201d\n\nFox Queen smiled and looked at Han Sen. \u201cSince you\u2019ve been so nice to your big sister, come and walk alongside me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, my big sister.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nFox Queen found it suspicious that Han Sen would give up his prize so easily, and she couldn\u2019t be certain if the tablet was genuine. She had to take Han Sen with her to the holy monument. Then, they could find out whether or not it was the real deal.\n\nFox Queen cast a spell, and one of her cords of power tethered Han Sen and the blood kirin to her. She smiled and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame me for this precaution. You have been misbehaving recently, my little brother, so I\u2019m afraid I have no choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry that I\u2019ve made you worry, big sister.\u201d Han Sen smiled coldly.\n\n\u201cWhat was that bird\u2019s nest that I saw you use earlier?\u201d Fox Queen looked Han Sen over, but she saw no sign of the bird\u2019s nest. The item had melted her cord of power, which made quite an impression on her.\n\n\u201cI hid it someplace in the White Bone Hell. If you can find it, I can give it to you as a gift.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nFox Queen wasn\u2019t in the mood to look. She couldn\u2019t find the bird\u2019s nest when she searched Han Sen\u2019s body, but that was fine by her. Hiding the nest in the White Bone Hell was like lobbing it into her personal warehouse. She would have plenty of time to seek it out later.\n\nFox Queen led Han Sen and the others out of the White Bone Hell and locked the hellish skeletal gate behind them. Then she ripped down the palace\u2019s gate, and the group left the palace.\n\n\u201cIt has been so long since I\u2019ve had the chance to breathe fresh air.\u201d Fox Queen stood under the sky, looking out at the stars as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen and Mister White stood together, but they didn\u2019t speak. Mister White and Ice Blue Knight King weren\u2019t in any better of a situation than Han Sen.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s temperament changed with the wind, and there was no telling who she might be ready to kill one hour from then.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go! We will head for the holy monument. Let\u2019s see what the Sacred Leader chose to leave behind,\u201d Fox Queen said, looking at Mister White.\n\n\u201cCrime, you lead the way,\u201d Mister White ordered.\n\n\u201cSir\u2026\u201d Crime said, his face pale.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking? Right now, surviving is our priority.\u201d Mister White gave a wry smile.\n\n\u201cMister White, you are very smart. Don\u2019t worry, though; I do not like killing. Once I have collected the legacy items of the Sacred Leader, you will all be allowed to return home safe and sound.\u201d Fox Queen smiled.\n\nIce Blue Knight King and the others were too smart to believe Fox Queen\u2019s promise to them, but they were in no position to gainsay her decisions. They had to do as Fox Queen told them.\n\nEven if they didn\u2019t tell Fox Queen the monument\u2019s location, she would find it at some point anyway. Withholding the information would only delay the inevitable.\n\nHarder and Ice Blue Knight King both looked at Mister White. It had taken them a second to realize that Mister White was the only one who knew where the monument was.\n\nHarder thought quickly as he walked. Amidst the people there, he was the only one who knew that Han Sen had stolen a stone tablet from Ghost Bone Town. The crystal stone that Han Sen had presented to Fox Queen wasn\u2019t the same item he had taken.\n\n\u201cHan Sen has guts, I\u2019ll give him that. He has actually dared to present a fake relic to Fox Queen. It is fake, though; they are sure to find that out once we reach the holy monument. And when that happens, I wonder what he is planning to do. Has he found a way to escape?\u201d Harder looked at Han Sen. If Han Sen behaved strangely, Harder would notice.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s chances of running away didn\u2019t seem very good. Fox Queen had a cord of power tied around him and the blood kirin, and she was being very careful to keep an eye on him. There was no way he could escape.\n\nWith Crime leading, they quickly traveled through the mountains and entered a primal forest. Many xenogeneics wandered across their path, but Ice Blue Knight King and Crime were able to cut them all down quickly. None of their foes were too strong.\n\nThey walked through the primal forest for four days. Eventually, Mister White pointed forward and spoke. \u201cHere it is!\u201d\n\nEveryone looked where Mister White was pointing. They all looked shocked, and even Han Sen furrowed his eyebrows in suspicion.\n\n\u201cThis is the holy monument?\u201d Fox Queen frowned at the sight.\n\nMister White was indicating an old tree. The tree was very thick; it would require four people holding hands to encircle it. But other than that, it looked quite ordinary. Not to mention the fact that it was dead. There was not a single leaf on it, and many of its branches were broken. It stood alone in a small clearing in the forest.\n\nIn a primal forest like the one they were standing in, such trees must have been a dime a dozen. Mister White told them it was a holy monument, but the unimpressive sight before them made it difficult to believe his claim.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the tree, and he could discern nothing special about it.\n\n\u201cThe Sacred Leader didn\u2019t want to put his treasure somewhere obvious. If you look a little closer, though, you are sure to see the truth of this amazing old tree,\u201d Mister White said quietly."
