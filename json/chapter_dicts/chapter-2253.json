    "text": "Ghost Bone\u2019s will had been destroyed by the black crystal armor. The Ghost Bone power was now left inside Han Sen\u2019s body, and although Han Sen could not make much use of it, his power was the same as that restrictive power. That provided him a new possibility.\n\nHan Sen needed to find a way in which he could break the restrictions, and by doing so, perhaps be able to escape that place.\n\nBut with Fox Queen there, she would not allow him to go and try various methods willy-nilly. If it came to a fight, Han Sen would not be able to defeat her. So, he had to find a way in which he could pretend to be nice and then break the restrictions.\n\n\u201cThese trappings are something that not even I am able to break. What makes you think you can do it?\u201d Fox Queen rolled her eyes at Han Sen. \u201cBut it is good that you can stay here. At least there will be someone here that can talk to me, and possibly prevent boredom settling in again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds good. But no matter how pretty you are, it\u2019ll be boring after a while. I don\u2019t have the mood or want to stay with you explicitly,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 you cannot say that. Ghost Bone changed my body to a Ghost Bone body. But I can still make use of a Ghost Bone power. I think the restrictions that trap this place are associated with the Ghost Bone powers. It would not be impossible to break,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nFox Queen looked rather bored now. \u201cThe restrictions here aren\u2019t solely of Ghost Bone powers. Even if Ghost Bone was reborn, he would not be able to unlock them because he wasn\u2019t deified. That is especially true of you. Just stay with me here, and things will be fine.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen returned to the palace. Han Sen followed her back to the palace, too.\n\nIt looked like the Fox Queen was not putting much stock in the prospect of escaping, and neither was she in much of a mood to talk about it. Han Sen could only examine and analyze the restrictions of the palace alone.\n\nHan Sen was not going to look at Fox Queen\u2019s restrictions just yet. Right now, he was examining the restrictions in the walls. If he was able to break them, Little Star could take him out of there.\n\nUsing Dongxuan Aura to observe the restrictions in the wall, he noticed they were perfect. The substance chains were bound tight, and they had a strange formation. Even if he was to use Super Spank, Han Sen\u2019s power would not be sufficient enough to break the chains.\n\nIf that was in the past, Han Sen would have no possible way of doing this.\n\nBut now he had a Ghost Bone body. And on top of that, he had the Ghost Bone power of a deified being. It was not impossible.\n\nIf Fox Queen was able to break one of the lines and let him slip through before, Han Sen thought he could make a way out himself.\n\nHan Sen used the Purple-Eye Butterfly to check out the entire palace. He was trying to see how the palace was built and in what manner.\n\nThe restrictions were not added separately. They were wound and built into the core of the construct itself. The stone of the palace was a part of the restrictions. Even Fox Queen herself was a part of that restriction. Unless the whole palace\u2019s restriction was wiped out, Fox Queen would never be able to leave. He wanted to break the palace\u2019s entire restriction, but by doing so, he would be challenging Fox Queen\u2019s own power. That was why she was not hoping to escape.\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone was smart. He himself came up with the palace\u2019s design, and then went ahead to build it.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions here are quite amazing, but it was all made through the Ghost Bone Technique. Now that I have a Ghost Bone body, if I can identify a flaw in the construct I might be able to escape, even if destroying the entire trappings will be difficult.\u201d Han Sen continued his analysis of the palace.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. In that palace that was full of restrictions, he did indeed manage to find a very small flaw.\n\nThat should not have even been called a flaw. It was just a loose substance, but to Han Sen it was a veritable hope.\n\nWhere Han Sen found it was near the fish statue near the pond. That was where he first entered the place from.\n\n\u201cIf I have guessed correctly here, there is a flaw. And that is because Fox Queen kept using her power to force that precise spot open so the little beast can go in and out in the effort to lure other creatures here. Although Fox Queen\u2019s power was unable to break the restriction entirely, after a long period of getting ripped a bit, the substance chain there loosened.\u201d Now, Han Sen had a way in which he could escape.\n\nOn Planet Ice Blue, a group of people were hiking deep into the mountains. If Han Sen saw this, he would be quite surprised. And that was because all of Ice Blue Base\u2019s big characters were there.\n\nMister White, Crime, Ice Blue Knights, a few King class Ice Blue Knights, Inspector Edward, and others. That team was the backbone of the Ice Blue Knights.\n\n\u201cMister White, with the amazing powers you have, not even you are able to deduce where Han Sen might have gotten to?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight next to Edward coldly said.\n\n\u201cMister White would not lie,\u201d Crime madly responded.\n\nMister White waved his hand to stop Crime from speaking any further. He coldly said, \u201cMy powers would not lead me astray, and all I can do is guess where he is right now. The only possibility of me not learning where he is, is because some strong power prevents me. All I can suggest, is that we prepare to fight. And in that case, I suspect a big fight will ensue when we do find him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will listen to all you tell us,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King quietly said.\n\nEdward stopped the Ice Blue Knight from talking. They followed Mister White and continued their onwards march.\n\nThe group of people were far in the mountains. Mister White kept leading them all, all the while calculating something.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy do you keep walking around and around? Come and talk to me.\u201d Fox Queen was staring at Han Sen while she lay down on a jade bed speaking to him.\n\n\u201cI am looking for a way in which we can break the restrictions binding this place, so that we can leave.\u201d Han Sen knew he would not be able to hide it from her, and so he told her straight.\n\nFox Queen, when hearing him, did not believe Han Sen could break the restrictions there.\n\n\u201cA night of fun is priceless. Stop wasting time and show some care to the people around you.\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s voice was layered in seduction, and she was like an enticing devil.\n\n\u201cDo the rest of the Ghost Bone Masks have half-deified powers?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Ghost Bone Masks in the side hall.\n\nFox Queen smiled. \u201cOf course not. This is just where General Ghost Bone used to live. When he was here, they did have power. But now that his power inside your body, those masks are useless now.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had thought of a way in which he could leave, but he was still too weak. He could not punch through the restriction that had loosened, and so, he had to find a different way to accomplish that.\n\nHan Sen grabbed a mask, and indeed, there was no power. It was, however, very sturdy.\n\n\u201cCan you open White Bone Big Hell for me to have a look?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nSince the Ghost Bone Masks were useless, Han Sen turned his mind to the blood kirin. If he was able to enlist its help, it would be far easier for them to leave.\n\n\u201cWhy would you want to go in there?\u201d Fox Queen asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI want to see if I can tame it. If I gain its power, I might be able to break the trappings.\u201d Han Sen was honest, as that was exactly what he was thinking.\n\n\u201cAh, okay. That is good thinking. Alright, you go do that.\u201d Fox Queen threw the black bone key that hung around her neck at Han Sen."
