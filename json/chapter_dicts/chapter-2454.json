    "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I should use the Wanjie Rubix Cube to leak my location?\u201d Han Sen immediately understood what the Treasure Identifier Elder was implying.\n\nThe Treasure Identifier Elder nodded and said, \u201cYes. The Extreme King have come looking for you, not your companions. If you keep letting them know where you are, they won\u2019t have any reason to conduct a general search that might endanger Qing Yu and the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Han Sen turned off the Wanjie Rubix Cube.\n\nWhat would be the point of using the Rubix cube now? He was inside the eyes of the spirit demon. If he began streaming video, people would only see the interior of the stone carriage. That wouldn\u2019t be very helpful for anyone.\n\nHan Sen needed to wait for a moment when a video stream would tell the Extreme King exactly where he was. Only then would it be worth turning the Rubix cube back on.\n\n\u201cI really, really hope that the demon spirit is planning to leave the Sea Demon Car soon. If he decides to stay in here for a few hundred years, that will be bad,\u201d Han Sen thought morosely.\n\nLuckily, Han Sen\u2019s worries didn\u2019t jinx his situation. Despite the time he spent envisioning the worst-case scenario, it didn\u2019t come to pass. After another half-day of travel, the Sea Demon Car came to a stop.\n\nThe spirit demon finally turned its eyes away from the wall of the carriage. The creature pushed the door open and slid out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s finally out!\u201d Han Sen was filled with happiness, but when he saw what was outside the carriage, he froze.\n\nBefore he entered the Tianxia System, Han Sen had done a lot of research about the place. He had learned that the system was filled with clouds and fog, but no planets were known to exist within it.\n\nBut as the demon spirit moved out of the carriage, Han Sen saw a giant island hanging in the clouds. The clouds surrounding them were pure white now, unlike the blue clouds that Han Sen had seen last. These fluffy white clouds looked like they belonged in an ordinary sky.\n\nThe demon spirit dropped onto the grass of the island. The fresh green grass turned to dust the moment that the demon spirit touched it. The dust rose and danced around the feet of the spirit demon, like ashes rising from a disturbed grave.\n\nWhen he fought, the demon spirit moved so quickly that it looked like he was teleporting. In this place, though, he walked forward as slowly as a normal person would, heading for a mountain at the center of the island.\n\nThe small mountain wasn\u2019t high, probably only reaching four hundred meters at its peak. Han Sen could have jumped over such a small mountain in a single leap. The demon spirit could probably have done the same with only a thought.\n\nBut instead, the demon spirit was walking up the mountain, step by step. He moved patiently, almost methodically.\n\n\u201cWhat is he trying to do?\u201d Han Sen wondered curiously.\n\nAlthough he wanted to flee, there were no creatures whose eyes he could jump into. The island was covered in grass and dotted with strange flowers, but there were no creatures to be seen.\n\nThe demon spirit left the Sea Demon Car behind without so much as a backward glance at the cloud dragons. Because of that, Han Sen couldn\u2019t even escape by jumping into the eyes of a cloud dragon.\n\nSince he couldn\u2019t run, Han Sen spent his time trying to guess what the demon spirit would do on the mountain. He had too little information to come up with any truly plausible theories, though.\n\nWhen the demon spirit reached the mountain\u2019s peak, Han Sen realized that the mountaintop was flat. It was about the size of a basketball court, and there was a building standing at its center. The building had two floors, and it appeared to have been constructed out of a beautiful variety of wood.\n\nThe building was surrounded by ornately fenced gardens. The gardens were full of greenery, but they weren\u2019t beautiful or well-kept. They were quite ugly, and only the walls that enclosed them were nice.\n\nA wooden gate provided an opening in the fence. As they approached the gate, Han Sen saw a plank of wood stuck in the earth. Three words were written down on it: \u201cNo Love House.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Love House? What does that mean?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nThe demon spirit drifted to a stop just outside the fence. The wooden door wasn\u2019t locked, but he seemed to have decided against going into the yard. He stood outside the fence, looking toward the window on the second floor.\n\nHan Sen thought the demon spirit might do something interesting, but he just stood there for about an hour. He didn\u2019t move an inch.\n\n\u201cPurple Fight, what are you doing here? I don\u2019t want to see you!\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice from the second floor. Her tone was hard and distant.\n\nThe demon spirit stayed where he was. He didn\u2019t move, and his eyes remained locked on the second-floor window.\n\nThe woman inside the wooden house pushed open the window and looked at the demon spirit angrily. She gnashed her teeth and said, \u201cGet lost! I don\u2019t want to see you again; either grant me that wish or just kill me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen, hearing the name Purple Fight, thought it sounded very familiar. After he searched his memory, he placed the name. His eyes and mouth opened wide in shock. \u201cThis name is like a clap of thunder in my ear. One of the ten generals of Sacred was the invincible General Purple Fight.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had spent a lot of time researching Sacred. After his fight with the Purple-Eye Butterfly, he carefully researched each of the ten generals. Ultimately, however, he wasn\u2019t able to learn much about them. But from the little information he had gathered, this General Purple Fight had struck him as being quite impressive.\n\nHe was invincible even when fighting alone, which earned him the nickname \u201cthe Invincible Solo.\u201d The name perfectly captured how frightening General Purple Fight was.\n\nThere was a legend that said before Purple Fight became a general, he was an enemy of Sacred Leader. At one point, Sacred Leader himself lost in a one-on-one fight against Purple Fight. That was why Purple Fight earned the title Invincible Solo.\n\nAfter that, Sacred Leader used some sort of trick to beat Purple Fight and claim ownership over him. Purple Fight became the strongest of Sacred\u2019s ten generals.\n\n\u201cIs this demon spirit General Purple Fight?\u201d Han Sen found it hard to believe.\n\nOut of the ten generals, General Ghost Bone was the best when it came to leading armies, and Purple-Eye Butterfly was the leader of intelligence-gathering. But when it came to fighting alone, Purple Fight was the greatest.\n\nIn a one-on-one deathmatch, the leaders of the three highest races of the universe couldn\u2019t defeat him.\n\nThe demon spirit saw the woman looking down on him, but he didn\u2019t say a word. He merely returned her gaze.\n\nHan Sen hesitated. He didn\u2019t know if he should stay in the demon spirit\u2019s eyes or make the jump into the woman\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe woman continued to send a string of blistering invectives and insults toward Purple Fight. But the demon spirit merely looked at her without moving. He didn\u2019t react to her words, and it was almost as if he wasn\u2019t getting scolded at all. That made Han Sen wonder if the demon spirit wasn\u2019t actually the Purple Fight the woman mentioned.\n\nWhen that woman grew tired of yelling, the demon spirit brought out an item. It appeared in the demon spirit\u2019s shadowy hand out of nowhere, and he carried it to the gate. He didn\u2019t touch the wood or the fence.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw the item that the demon spirit had set on the ground, his eyes brightened. It was a book. The book was made of stone, and there were seven words written upon the cover: \u201cShocking World Record of the Extreme King.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! That is the Extreme King\u2019s exclusive geno art. How did the demon spirit get ahold of it? Right, he must have gotten it from Bao Qin. Bao Qin must have had it somewhere on his person when he fought the demon spirit,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nWhen the woman saw the Shocking World Record of the Extreme King, she looked even more distraught. She screamed, \u201cPurple Fight, what is the point of you bringing me all the geno arts in the world? They are meaningless to me. Either kill me or let me go!"
