But it went above and beyond what Han Sen had previously endured. The ten split up into a hundred. The hundred split up into a thousand. The thousand then split up into ten thousand.\n\nA ten thousand-strong army of swords departed the caster\u2019s hand, flew up high, and hung in the air. They cloaked the entire sky, making the world below look doomed.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, seeing all those swords hovering above the lake with their pointy ends facing down. He grabbed ahold of Bao\u2019er and readied himself to escape.\n\nXie Qing King was unfazed by this threat, though. The silver that coursed around and across his body burned brighter than ever.\n\nThe swords began to drop. But just as this occurred, the light inside Xie Qing King seemed to diminish and look almost wholly extinguished.\n\nYet he did not retreat or step down. As the color faded away, he just stood there, watching the swords fall like rain.\n\nBoom!\n\nAs the Storm of Swords began, the color of the skies changed. The world was about to become a ragged pincushion.\n\nAs Xie Qing King witnessed the descent of all those swords, his silver light return brighter than ever before, like a flashbang. As that light encompassed the area, he threw a punch upwards as if to knockout the sky itself.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe silver light annihilated the mist of swords as if they were all composed of wafer-thin, brittle copper.\n\nThe silver light then moved towards Holy-Sword Emperor. The spirit\u2019s face was one of utter shock, but it didn\u2019t last. Within the course of the next second, he was vaporized by the fallout of that blinding flash.\n\nWhen the light subsided and the sky cleared up again, Xie Qing King coldly said, \u201cNo one threatens me.\u201d\n\nAfter that, he fell to the ground. All the healing he had received was gone again, and the wounds across his body opened up once more. The lifeforce was now so low, he could pass for an ordinary human.\n\nWith Bao\u2019er, Han Sen stepped forward to examine Xie Qing King. When they did, they noticed his lifeforce was in a state that was beyond recovery; he was dying.\n\nBeing so injured and casting an attack like that anyway could be ruinous. It was fortunate he did not outright die through some sort of wicked implosion, brought on by the buckling of a weakened body trying to cast such a terrifying attack.\n\nBut Han Sen admired him even more now. The bravery he displayed was exemplary.\n\nHan Sen was considering using the silver fox\u2019s healing power to try and save him, or at least stop the bleeding, but suddenly, a noise sounded. Holy-Sword Emperor was still alive, crawling to his feet from beneath a mound of broken sword pieces.\n\n\u201cNo way! I saw him explode. He was vaporized!\u201d Han Sen looked on in disbelief.\n\nXie Qing King was in an equal amount of shock. He mumbled, \u201cThere is no way you survived that attack of mine.\u201d\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor coldly growled, \u201cYou really are good. You broke my Storm of Swords; if it wasn\u2019t for my Holy-Sword Doll, I\u2019d have been killed. Using it now was a grand loss, but it will have been worth it, if it has granted me the opportunity to kill someone as prestigious as you.\u201d\n\nWhen Holy-Sword Emperor said this, he ran towards Xie Qing King in a huff. Then he stepped on his face.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor made it sound as if he didn\u2019t mind the loss of the Holy-Sword Doll, but in truth, it bitterly stung him. It had cost him a fortune to grow it.\n\nBut he hated Xie Qing King, and having his scroll of the phoenix stolen drove him mad. He hated his guts.\n\nXie Qing King looked at Holy-Sword Emperor with eyes that were filled with disdain.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor hated that look, so he rubbed his foot in his face harder and applied as much pressure as he could.\n\nSuddenly, a golden light appeared and Holy-Sword Emperor felt a strange power approach. It was Han Sen, clutching his Phoenix Sword.\n\n\u201cYou are just a human; do you really wish to threaten me with that? I can kill you in the blink of an eye. But unlike this prehistoric fool, you won\u2019t respawn.\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor knew Han Sen was a human, and he thought that Xie Qing King had simply taken Han Sen as an average human slave.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right; I can\u2019t respawn.\u201d Han Sen smirked, and then went on to say, \u201cKilling someone in battle is fair play, but humiliating someone like him is wrong. You can\u2019t humiliate him.\u201d\n\nHearing this, Xie Qing King\u2019s eyes jumped a little. What he was now thinking about, though, none could guess.\n\n\u201cHahaha! You can\u2019t tell me what to do. No one tells me what to do, ever! You are in no position to lick my boots clean, let alone lecture me about humiliating an old fart that\u2019s past his prime.\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor brought his foot down harder, and then barked, \u201cI will break your limbs one by one, boy. And I\u2019ll make you watch how I slowly torture and humiliate this worthless spirit. And once I\u2019m done with him, I\u2019ll skin you alive and wear you for a coat!\u201d\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor summoned a few more swords and fired them towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen swung his sword to knock the incoming projectiles away. Then he said, \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass me with such lame attacks. Come on, show me what you\u2019ve really got.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew Holy-Sword Emperor would come for him eventually, and a fight between them was inevitable. If he wanted to maintain his control of Sword-Furnace Shelter, though, he had to learn how to beat the spirit. Now was the time he could put his strength to the test.\n\n\u201cD*mn you!\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor now felt like the one being humiliated. He couldn\u2019t believe a human was brazen enough to speak to him like that.\n\nAnother ten thousand swords were summoned, all propped up in his direction, prepared to skin Han Sen alive.\n\nBut Han Sen was still calm, and all of a sudden, the wings of a crow formed upon his back."
