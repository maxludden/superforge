    "text": "\u201cTrees make babies? Is this requiem tree a xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen asked in confusion.\n\nMiss Mirror shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the requiem tree is a xenogeneic, but it doesn\u2019t produce babies. The tree egg is essentially a collection of the tree\u2019s resin. The more energy a requiem tree takes in, the more resin it can produce. That resin gathers inside the tree hole to become an orb. It looks something like an ant egg. They are called tree eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was told a story of a man who managed to get a requiem tree egg that was around the size of a fingernail. He was only a low-tier King, but he used the requiem tree egg\u2019s power to advance all the way to deified. Ever since then, requiem tree eggs have become the most sought after treasure in the entire universe. But the ability of requiem tree eggs to help a King class being rise to deified is only of secondary importance. People are more interested in them because they can be used to help deified individuals ascend.\u201d Miss Mirror paused and went on to say, \u201cBut considering the battle that happened here, I\u2019m afraid the requiem tree egg inside the tree hole has already been taken away.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s still here. Let me see,\u201d Night Wind said. Then he launched himself into the air and flew up to the tree hole. He hovered right in front of it, putting his eyes right near the tree hole to peer inside.\n\n\u201cThis tree hole is strange. I\u2019m looking right into it, but I cannot see anything inside,\u201d Night Wind said to Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cRequiem trees are resting trees for the Ancient God. They have unusual powers, so not even deified elites can see what is inside the tree hole. Luckily, requiem tree holes aren\u2019t dangerous. Just put your hand inside,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nNight Wind hesitated, but he did as he was instructed. Just in case, he shrouded his hand in night power that would defend against anything evil that might have taken up residence inside the tree hole. Then he placed his hand into the hole.\n\nShe said the tree hole wasn\u2019t dangerous, but who knew if some toxic bug had decided to make its home there or something. This entire city felt cursed, and so by Night Wind\u2019s reasoning, bizarre toxic bugs weren\u2019t out of the question.\n\nSeeing Night Wind place his hand in the hole, Han Sen felt nervous on his behalf. If there was something weird inside the tree hole, and it pulled Night Wind inside, that would actually be kind of scary.\n\nBut after Night Wind plunged his hand into the hole, a grin crossed his face. He shouted, \u201cThere is something in here! It is circular, and it feels like a stone. I don\u2019t know if it is a requiem tree egg, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cTouch it with your hand. If it is a requiem tree egg, your hand will smell like resin,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nNight Wind touched the item and then pulled his hand out of the hole to sniff it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t actually need to bring it up to his nose. Even at the bottom of the tree, Han Sen and Miss Mirror could smell that pleasant, grassy fragrance. Just the smell alone was enough to make Han Sen feel like his body was waking up after a long winter. He felt so relaxed, it was like his cells were coming alive.\n\n\u201cNot bad! That is the smell of a requiem tree egg. I can barely believe that the requiem tree egg is still there. Pull it out!\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nNight Wind immediately reached into the hole again to pull the tree egg out. But when he tried to draw his arms back out, they stopped abruptly. He couldn\u2019t seem to get the egg out.\n\n\u201cThe egg is too big! I can\u2019t get it to fit through the hole,\u201d Night Wind said. He pulled out his sword of darkness to slash the tree hole in an attempt to widen it.\n\nBut when the sword of darkness hit the bark of the tree, it only left a small white scratch mark behind. There wasn\u2019t the faintest semblance of a firm dent.\n\n\u201cTrying to cut it is useless! The requiem tree is the resting place of many members of the Ancient God. Even a tiny requiem tree is impervious to most powers and gear, and this tree is enormous,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cCan he not crack the egg into pieces and bring them out like that?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThe egg will be harder than the requiem tree itself. How is he supposed to break it?\u201d Miss Mirror rolled her eyes at Han Sen. Then she turned to Night Wind again. \u201cHow big is the tree egg?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery big\u2026\u201d Night Wind said, his voice strangely distracted.\n\n\u201cHow big is very big? Big like a brain?\u201d Han Sen asked with a laugh.\n\nA fingernail-sized requiem tree egg turned a King into a deified. If there was a brain-sized requiem tree egg, it would probably start a war that would consume the entire universe.\n\n\u201cIf your brain is one meter across, then yes, it is sized like your brain,\u201d Night Wind said quietly. Han Sen noticed that the man\u2019s eyes were very wide.\n\n\u201cWhat? That large?\u201d Han Sen asked hoarsely. His eyes almost popped out of his skull. He could scarcely believe how big that was.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that is a requiem tree egg and not something else?\u201d Miss Mirror asked with shock. Not even she could believe it.\n\nNo one had ever heard of such a giant requiem tree egg before. Even small eggs were considered priceless relics among deified elites, but this\u2026\n\nThe thought of a one-meter long requiem tree egg was enough to make people\u2019s blood boil and their hearts leap in their chests. The power of something like that was beyond imagining.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You should confirm it yourself, Miss Mirror.\u201d Night Wind came down from the tree hole. He still looked somewhat shell-shocked as he spoke to Miss Mirror.\n\nIt was weird to see such an expression on Night Wind\u2019s face. But when seeing a requiem egg such as that, even a deified was bound to have difficulty managing their excitement.\n\nA requiem tree egg could strengthen deifieds. A requiem tree egg the size of a plum could increase a deified\u2019s level by quite a bit. If a deified refined a tree egg of this magnitude, they could easily become a god spirit.\n\nMiss Mirror flew up to the tree hole. She put her hand in and began feeling around the tree hole. Seconds later, her jaw hung slack in wonder.\n\n\u201cIt really is a requiem tree egg. I cannot believe that such a large egg exists.\u201d Miss Mirror finally said after ten minutes of fiddling. Her expression said that she wasn\u2019t entirely sure how she should feel.\n\n\u201cIt really is a requiem tree egg,\u201d Han Sen and Night Wind said together.\n\n\u201cYes, and it is also circular. It is somewhere between a meter and two meters across.\u201d Miss Mirror couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cIt is a shame that the tree hole is only the size of a fist. If it was a small requiem tree egg, we could take it out. Now we know that there is a tree egg inside and that it is something that would change the universe as we know it. However, we don\u2019t have a way to remove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait! Maybe there\u2019s a way to get it out.\u201d Night Wind suddenly sounded exhilarated.\n\n\u201cWhat? You have a way to expand the tree hole?\u201d Han Sen looked at Night Wind. Miss Mirror looked at him as well, a single eyebrow raised.\n\nInstead of answering, Night Wind used his finger to point at the tree excitedly, and spoke, \u201cLook over there.\u201d\n\nHan Sen and Miss Mirror followed his finger. A deep scar ran across one side of the tree. It was a three-foot-long gash, and it was three fingers deep, at least.\n\n\u201cThat is a sword mark.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes brightened.\n\nThe sword mark was old, and even though the tree had healed, there was a scar. But based on the angle of the scar, it looked as if it had been delivered by the big sword they had found earlier."
