    "text": "Fox Queen\u2019s beautiful face darkened. \u201cAre you mocking me by suggesting that I lost to the hands of your teacher?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are looking into my words too deeply, sister.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s expression was like ice, and she said, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been suppressed for so long that my talents stagnated, your teacher wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat me. When I regain my strength, I am going to break her.\u201d\n\nClearly, Fox Queen still harbored much contempt for Yisha due to her defeat. She seemed to care about her loss quite a lot.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still recovering, why have you come here to the Extreme King?\u201d Han Sen asked with a grin. He wanted to get whatever information he could from her.\n\nFox Queen gave him a beatific smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not here to cause you trouble. I am actually hoping to work with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to cooperate? Why?\u201d Han Sen looked at Fox Queen with confusion.\n\n\u201cSo we can steal treasure, of course. If there wasn\u2019t treasure up for grabs, why would I be here with the Extreme King?\u201d Fox Queen said, stepping closer to Han Sen. She reached out to touch Han Sen on the cheek, but he leapt fifty meters away like a rabbit. He looked very alert.\n\n\u201cHuh, that\u2019s not very courageous of you. Do not worry, I need your help. I don\u2019t intend to do anything bad to you,\u201d Fox Queen assured him with a chuckle.\n\nHan Sen coldly said, \u201cI am just a small-time Duke. I don\u2019t think I will be able to help you.\u201d\n\nFox Queen had been bold to sneak into the Extreme King. Whatever she wanted to steal had to be important. If someone made the Extreme King angry, the elite race would probably destroy that person\u2019s friends and family.\n\nEven if Han Sen wasn\u2019t afraid, he had to think about his family and friends on Planet Eclipse.\n\nPlus, evil women like Fox Queen were completely untrustworthy. She would happily betray anyone she wanted to.\n\n\u201cYou will help me. I am merely here to say hello so that you will be prepared,\u201d Fox Queen said. Her body returned to her guise of Red Sleeve. She waved at Han Sen and went on to say, \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. It would be bad if someone saw you with me. I will see you later, my good brother.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen put her fingers to her sexy red lips. She blew Han Sen a kiss and then flew away.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Fox Queen had come there to see him and reveal her true self. She was clearly there to warn him about exposing her true identity.\n\n\u201cHow dare she threaten me. It\u2019s not like she can blackmail me or anything, but she seems too confident. She must have her reasons. She couldn\u2019t be bluffing me, could she?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t figure out her current game. He wondered what had really compelled her to expose her true self to him there.\n\nHan Sen put away thoughts of Fox Queen and got back to hunting down xenogeneics.\n\nHis pursuit of xenogeneics eventually brought him to an orange mountain. When he landed, a wall began to shake next to him.\n\nA creature made of black metal emerged. It looked like a doll, and it walked right out of the wall. Its body moved with machine-like clumsiness as it approached Han Sen.\n\n\u201cA Duke class metal doll?\u201d Han Sen grinned.\n\nMetal dolls were Planet King Kong\u2019s special type of xenogeneic. They were very rare, and it was uncommon to see one away from the metal mines.\n\nThe metal doll\u2019s xenogeneic gene was an extremely rare ingredient of xenogeneic treasure. It was a Duke class item, but it was a valued component for the creation of King class xenogeneic treasures.\n\nThe body of a metal doll was a good xenogeneic treasure ingredient, as well. Its entire body was valuable.\n\nHan Sen needed xenogeneic genes, and a metal doll was worth a dozen ordinary Duke xenogeneic genes.\n\nThe creature\u2019s body looked clumsy, and it suddenly started moving. Its fist flashed toward Han Sen like lightning.\n\nThe thing might have looked awkward, but it moved with incredible speed. An ordinary person couldn\u2019t have reacted to its attack in time.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s reaction times were the best of the best. He jumped up and dodged the metal doll\u2019s swift punch, then he struck back with his Ghost Teeth Knife and cut the metal doll\u2019s brain in half.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke hunted. Metal Doll: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Metal Doll beast soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gave me a beast soul? I wonder what type of beast soul it is.\u201d Han Sen was delighted. He checked out the beast soul inside his Sea of Soul.\n\nDuke Beast Soul Metal Doll: Halo-type\n\nBefore Han Sen could try out the beast soul, a loud noise came from overhead. Someone landed right next to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen turned to take a look at the man next to him. His presence was intimidating, and he was definitely King class.\n\n\u201cLeave the item there, and I will permit you to go,\u201d the King class guard said coldly. Then he moved to pick up the remains of the metal doll.\n\n\u201cThat is my kill!\u201d Han Sen stepped onto the metal doll, knocking it from the other guard\u2019s grip. The metal doll shook beneath Han Sen\u2019s legs. It didn\u2019t go to the King class guard.\n\nThe King class guard chuckled icily. \u201cYou are allowed to kill and rob whoever you want in Knight\u2019s Paradise. I\u2019m only taking the prey and not your life in respect for Queen Bai Wei. If you meant nothing to her, I would have already killed you for what you just said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not superstitious. You said I would have been killed? I would like to see if that is true,\u201d Han Sen stated flatly, still standing on the body of the metal doll.\n\nKing Bai allowed his children and grandchildren to fight, but he made sure there were rules in place to keep them from killing each other. They didn\u2019t have to worry about dying.\n\nAs long as King Bai lived, no royal child would kill their peers.\n\nBut the lives of the children\u2019s Royal Guards were nowhere near as important. Royal Guards were often killed in the squabbles between royal children.\n\nKnight\u2019s Paradise was something of a dangerous area. The guards killed xenogeneics there, and also competed against other guards. It wasn\u2019t like the King\u2019s Garden, where killing was forbidden. This would be an easy place to get away with murder.\n\nThe King class guard was totally correct. He would offend Bai Wei if he killed Han Sen there, but no one would hold him personally responsible. He\u2019d still be free.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to back off, though. He had come to the Extreme King to claim resources, and he would not give up easily.\n\n\u201cIf you want to die, then don\u2019t take it out on me for obliging you,\u201d the King class guard growled. Then he cast a green area-of-effect which covered a distance of a few thousand meters.\n\nInside the attack\u2019s perimeter, Han Sen now felt as if he was in water. The stifling power was so strong that he couldn\u2019t move freely.\n\nClearly, the AoE had a water element that lowered Han Sen\u2019s mobility."
