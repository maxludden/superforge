Not all emperors showed interest in the affair.\n\nThe general consensus among spirits was that the mightiest throughout the entire Third God\u2019s Sanctuary was a spirit called Ruin Emperor; an emperor that far exceeded No God Emperor\u2019s capabilities, as well.\n\nRuin Emperor\u2019s greatest ability was the one that trapped the powers of his opponents. All attacks were rendered useless, and repeats were disabled. Ruin Emperor\u2019s power was something none had ever been able to beat or overcome.\n\nThe ability made Ruin Emperor indestructible in every sense of the word, and it was the power-trapping aspect that defined the emperor.\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor, why didn\u2019t you stay on Ultimate Mountain? Why have you come here?\u201d Moment Queen asked.\n\nRuin Emperor responded to her question, telling her, \u201cUnless you want a repeat of what occurred before, stay out of this. You have done well to return to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, but I will smite you back down if you dare to meddle in this.\u201d\n\nRuin Emperor looked over towards Lotus Empress and said, \u201cI have a great deal of respect for your mother. Although I cannot say the same to you, I am willing to spare your life in honor of who your mother is.\u201d\n\nLotus Empress asked him herself, saying, \u201cWhy have you gotten involved in this?\u201d\n\n\u201cGodslayer Luo\u2019s heir must die.\u201d Ruin Emperor spoke this while staring directly at Zero.\n\nNo God Emperor, Gu Demon Emperor, and Three-Eye Emperor then leaped forward to join Ruin Emperor in battle. \u201cMoment, you dare show your face here? How typical; for you to spend your days with these wretched vermin! I will finish you once and for all today by destroying your spirit stone,\u201d No God Emperor said.\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor and No God Emperor are both here? They\u2019ll mop the floor with the human and his mates.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuin Emperor should grab a seat. I bet even No God Emperor has what it takes to destroy each and every one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith their powers trapped, they are dead men walking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister Ruin is the strongest in the entire sanctuary. None can stop him.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe spirits that were spectating these events were beginning to forget the horrors of what had happened prior to Ruin Emperor\u2019s arrival. They were actually feeling happy and hopeful for a positive outcome for the day, despite the heavy losses they had incurred. They were particularly keen at the prospect of watching the cocky human get killed; for some, who had no history with Godslayer Luo, that was who they wanted to see suffer more than anyone.\n\nWith Ruin Emperor suppressing their enemies now, they were overjoyed.\n\nHan Sen was surprised, much to his dismay. Even Little Silver and Purple Emperor\u2019s powers were rendered useless against Ruin Emperor. Even their powers had been taken away.\n\n\u201cHow does this emperor achieve such a technique? This should be impossible!\u201d Han Sen frowned, almost unable to believe what was happening was a legitimate truth.\n\nHan Sen believed it to be a rule of the universe that there was no beat-all power or technique, and nothing was truly invincible. Everything had a weakness to be exploited; it just needed to be found. But even if Ruin Emperor had one, Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d take advantage of it without his powers. Not even the silver fox could aid him this time.\n\nHan Sen could not use his time and space powers, but he could at the very least use lightning.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen summoned a lightning-wreathed manifestation of a hammer: his Thunder Hammer. But it shattered when it was brought down on Ruin Emperor\u2019s body.\n\nAfter this, though, Han Sen realized he could no longer repeat the skill. That had been trapped, too.\n\n\u201cThis is too weird.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cAll your powers are useless before Mister Ruin. Haha!\u201d Three-Eye Emperor laughed at Han Sen.\n\nRuin Emperor was not interested in Han Sen, though. He had come for the heir of Godslayer Luo, and he had done so with a seething hatred. He ignored Han Sen\u2019s transgression and merely stared at Zero.\n\nRuin Emperor was approaching Zero, and making good on the promise of protecting her, Han Sen ran forward to at least try and prevent him from getting any closer.\n\nRuin Emperor did not bother dodging the attacks, as he had done before, but his behavior was different. He moved his arm to block Han Sen\u2019s attempted swordstrike.\n\nThere was a bracelet on his arm, and when Han Sen\u2019s sword came into contact with it, his blade became stuck to it.\n\nStill, Han Sen had now noticed that despite Ruin Emperor being resistant to every element under the sun, he was not resistant to good old, plain, physical power.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s swordstrike had been delivered without any associated element, and it had prompted Ruin Emperor to block with his arm.\n\nUnfortunately, the joy of this realization was cut short, for the bracelet on that arm had a strong suction. When Han Sen tried to heave his sword away, he pulled the emperor with him, and it was at this moment Ruin Emperor tried to punch Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen saw this, and he threw a fist in response. When Ruin Emperor saw the incoming punch, though, his stern face dropped to one of sudden surprise.\n\nWhen the fists met with each other, even that mighty emperor himself was sent stumbling backwards.\n\nThree-Eye Emperor and Gu Demon Emperor staggered. They could not believe Han Sen had made Ruin Emperor reel backwards.\n\nFlower Empress swiftly spoke aloud in praise of Han Sen, saying, \u201cWhoa! Did you see that? A powerful human, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nEast Empress was in agreement, and she sought to offer commentary to the spirits with her and explain what they had just seen. She said, \u201cThere are only two powers Ruin Emperor is unable to trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are those?\u201d Heavenly Empress asked.\n\n\u201cOne is Godslayer Luo\u2019s own power. He and Ruin Emperor once fought,\u201d East Empress said.\n\n\u201cWhat happened during their fight?\u201d Flower Empress thought Ruin Emperor had battled Godslayer Luo and emerged victorious, but that might not have been the case. She was being told Godslayer Luo\u2019s power could not be trapped, after all.\n\n\u201cNeither of them won.\u201d East Empress paused for a brief moment, before going on to say, \u201cRuin Emperor was unable to trap his opponent\u2019s powers, but Godslayer Luo did not have what it took to withstand Ruin Emperor\u2019s own strength, as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what is the second power Ruin Emperor cannot trap?\u201d Flower Empress asked.\n\n\u201cPhysical. Raw physical might. He can trap every elemental attack, but this ability does not hold water when it comes to physical strength,\u201d East Empress explained.\n\nHan Sen put away his swords next, and simply activated Jadeskin before unleashing a barrage of rapid-fire punches."
