    "text": "Han Sen planned to practice in the mountains. He didn\u2019t need to practice Teeth Knife, but there were too many spies occupying the base. If Han Sen stayed there without practicing, people might grow suspicious.\n\nSo, Han Sen headed into the mountains to train. But instead of practicing Teeth Knife as he had told everyone, he began to work on the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nHis Mutant Blood and Jadeskin had reached Viscount class, but the Dongxuan Sutra and The Story of Genes hadn\u2019t. The Story of Genes couldn\u2019t be leveled up through mere practice, so he could only focus on the Dongxuan Sutra for now.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t take anyone with him this time. He planned to push himself hard in order to breakthrough, which would make it dangerous to have others around him.\n\nFortunately, there were many resources on Planet Eclipse. Xie Qing King and others could venture out and hunt xenogeneics on their own. The people he had brought over from the sanctuaries could eat xenogeneic genes and use beast souls, so they leveled up faster than the people in the geno universe.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Gene Eaten; Iron Wolf; Viscount Gene +1.\u201d\n\nHan Sen gobbled up some xenogeneic meat, and his Viscount xenogeneic gene tally increased. When one of his bodies became Viscount, he could increase that gene tally. Baron xenogeneic genes were currently useless for him. He had to eat Viscount materials exclusively now.\n\nKilling Viscount xenogeneics was an easy task for Han Sen, and his Viscount genes were increasing quickly.\n\nAfter six days of travel, Han Sen found himself more than a thousand miles deep into the mountains. He met strong Marquise creatures, but he was able to run away with the rabbit shoes. Overall, the venture wasn\u2019t too dangerous.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d As Han Sen treaded along a path, he spied the presence of a strange mountain.\n\nThe weather on Planet Eclipse wasn\u2019t great. There was no grass growing, and so all the mountains were barren and rocky.\n\nThe mountain in front of him was very green, though. Trees were growing all over it. There were flowers, and some of the plants even possessed fruit.\n\nThere were birds and insects on this mountain. They were far away, but Han Sen could feel their lifeforce.\n\n\u201cPlanet Eclipse has a mountain like this?\u201d Han Sen thought it was weird. He examined the surrounding area and realized that it was the only mountain like this in the region.\n\nHan Sen carefully approached it. There had to be a reason why it was so luscious. Perhaps there was a treasure or something; that thought prompted Han Sen to have a look around.\n\nHan Sen trekked to the mountain. While he noticed that there were a large collection of lifeforces coming from the mountain, he could tell that the birds and the trees were completely normal. There didn\u2019t seem to be any xenogeneics, either.\n\n\u201cWeird. Xenogeneic plants are difficult to grow on this planet, and even xenogeneic creatures often have trouble surviving. And yet, how are these all alive? Especially since they seem so ordinary.\u201d Han Sen was quite curious about this anomaly.\n\nHan Sen kept walking up the mountain, and the foliage was just as lovely as it had appeared from a distance. Normal plants and creatures were spread out all across the mountain, as if the entire mountain had been transplanted to Planet Eclipse.\n\nAfter an hour, Han Sen was able to reach the peak. He was quite shocked by the view he now saw, though.\n\nAtop the mountain, amidst a small grove of trees, there was an emerald field. A wooden house stood there, and it looked very old.\n\n\u201cIs anyone there?\u201d Han Sen called out to the occupied house. He thought it was a strange thing to find, and so he thought to himself, \u201cWho could build a house in a place like this?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shouted again, but he received no response. So, he walked to the house because the windows were open. He wanted to take a look at what was inside from there.\n\nThe decorations of the interior were simple and rustic. They were all comprised of wood, and the primary features were a table and bed. Even the teapot and the plates were made of wood. It looked as if the people there used wood to build everything.\n\nThe wood was not big, though. You could see it all in one eye. There was a room at the back of the house, too, but you could not see it from outside.\n\n\u201cIs anyone in here?\u201d Han Sen asked. He received no response. So, he pushed open the door and it swung forward. A lock hadn\u2019t been fixed on it.\n\nHan Sen walked inside and poked around. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything worth examining, so he decided to check out the back room.\n\nHan Sen opened the door and froze. All of a sudden, he found a person standing next to the bed. They were facing Han Sen with their eyes open.\n\n\u201cI am sorry. I called from the outside, and I believed this place was empty.\u201d Han Sen explained, but his words were met with awkward silence. Something was giving him pause.\n\nThat was because the person next to the bed was a man: a human.\n\nThe man stood where he was and did not move. He didn\u2019t even look at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d Han Sen looked at the man and spoke carefully. He wanted to know what he was, and why there might be a human there.\n\nBut Han Sen did not know for sure that the man was a human. He could have been a crystallizer, forgotten long ago.\n\nHan Sen asked him a few questions, and each time he received no response. Han Sen would have thought the man was dead if not for his lifeforce.\n\n\u201cMy name is Han Sen. What is yours?\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen said that, the man suddenly moved. He put a finger in front of his lips, like a gesture to indicate he should be quiet. The man did not appear hostile, and that brought Han Sen much relief. He stopped talking and just watched the man.\n\nThe man continued standing there for a whole hour, without saying as much as a single word. He looked more like a statue than a living being.\n\n\u201cIs he practicing, maybe? Hmm, but it doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d Han Sen felt very confused, but also very curious. He sat on a chair to watch the man and see what he\u2019d do.\n\nBut ten hours went by, and still, the man did not budge.\n\n\u201cFriend, can we talk?\u201d Han Sen could not wait any longer.\n\n\u201cSsh!\u201d The man gestured for silence again.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart sank. He hadn\u2019t a clue what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t ask anything, as the man kept hushing him.\n\nHan Sen looked around the room and noticed that it was all rustic, just like the rest of the house. Han Sen looked at a table and found something that was actually not made of wood. There was paper, alongside a stack of books.\n\n\u201cFriend, can I check this out?\u201d Han Sen walked before the table and glanced over the books. There was a diary with many words scrawled on it.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t begin reading immediately. He still wanted to ask the man for permission.\n\nThe man looked very nervous, and he performed the ssh gesture again.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t object, then I\u2019ll assume you are agreeing.\u201d Han Sen went ahead to read the contents of the diary."
