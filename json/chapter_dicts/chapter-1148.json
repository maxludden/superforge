He only had one Crimson Fruit, as it was a treasure from a king spirit tree that could only provide one with each harvest. That harvest took one-hundred-thousand years to grow. He wouldn\u2019t be able to receive another one quite so easily.\n\nBut while Yaksha was angry, he was not in panic mode yet.\n\nThe Crimson Fruit may not have entered the door, but its appearance had still distracted Xiang Yin quite a bit. She looked to be at the end of her tether, and taking that last step seemed out of her reach.\n\nHan Sen had been grievously injured, but he had come back alone. The super creatures were still on his trail, so it was something that was in Yaksha\u2019s favor.\n\nAnd so, Yaksha decided to attack Han Sen. He thought it was about time Han Sen got a pummeling, and he very much wanted to see him writhing in agony when the posse of super creatures also caught up.\n\nBut all of a sudden, Han Sen blazed with a bright white light. His hair turned white and flowed down to his feet. His eyes turned as white as his gleaming, ivory armor.\n\nPat!\n\nHan Sen clicked his fingers and turned the entire cavern into one coinstorm cloud. Coins manifested in the air and dropped from every inch of that place. The creatures that sought to catch up with Han Sen were immediately suppressed and brought to the ground.\n\nYaksha\u2019s body was pumping with pure, unbridled hatred and rage. He swung his lethal nails around to slice the coins.\n\nBut unlike before, Han Sen did not keenly evade Yaksha. All he did was raise the corner of his lips. In his ordinary form, Han Sen was too weak to block Yaksha\u2019s attacks; that\u2019s why he had to focus on evasion.\n\nNow things were different. Although Yaksha\u2019s speed was still greater, super king spirit made Han Sen stronger.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, between all that was going on, Yaksha\u2019s mind was screaming.\n\nPang!\n\nYaksha\u2019s nails were about to descend on Han Sen, but he did not move until they were about to skewer his eyeballs. And that move was to grab Yaksha by the waist and prevent him from being able to move.\n\n\u201cHow?!\u201d Green, pulsating veins scrawled over Yaksha\u2019s arms. Try as he might to resist, he could not move or free himself.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s hands were like chains, tying up his waist.\n\n\u201cYou are right; you are dead!\u201d Han Sen said, just as his white light grew in intensity.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s grip on Yaksha tightened, as the madman flailed in hopeless resistance.\n\nYaksha tried using his nails to slice Han Sen\u2019s belly. He was fast that not even light itself would have been able to dodge.\n\nBut Yaksha\u2019s failing was his anger, and how he screamed on the inside. Han Sen knew exactly what was going through his mind, and he knew what to do.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen threw his other fist to repel Yaksha\u2019s incoming nailstrike. There was so much power in that parry, it broke every finger on Yaksha\u2019s hand. They all bent backwards like broken twigs.\n\nBut the fist didn\u2019t just stop there. Han Sen\u2019s fist continued going forward right into Yaksha\u2019s face.\n\nPang!\n\nYaksha wanted to scream, but he couldn\u2019t after that. His lips and jaw had been shattered and smashed. They were twisted and ruined so much that Yaksha could barely control his mouth. His body leaned back.\n\nHis other arm was still held by Han Sen, and now, Han Sen gave it a tug.\n\nHan Sen pulled Yaksha forward and delivered another punch.\n\nYaksha\u2019s skull cracked, and the force of that second punch sent a shockwave through the cavern.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang!\n\nYaksha would take a punch, fall back limply, then be tugged forward only to be hit again. This process repeated again and again. Eventually, one of Yaksha\u2019s eyeballs fell out of its socket. He no longer looked human.\n\nYaksha\u2019s speed was useless against Han Sen in such a state. His brain had been rattled too much, his mind was a mish-mash of displaced thoughts that scrambled to gather cohesion.\n\nHan Sen, seeing Yaksha was on the razor\u2019s edge between life and death, let him go. And then, with both fists, planned to give him one last brutal hit.\n\nAlu Alu Alu!\n\nHan Sen suddenly screamed like Xie Qing King. The last hit he sought to deliver turned to a great many, and he punched like a nutter. Over and over he threw his fists, with each one making him feel better than before.\n\nAll of Yaksha\u2019s bones had been broken, and eventually, his meat and skin were little more than a crumpled sack to contain a collapsing skeleton.\n\nYaksha squealed like a dying pig, and in his final moments, Han Sen moved forward to pick him up.\n\nThe creatures that sought to attack Han Sen stopped, not wanting to meddle with such a frightening foe.\n\nThe creatures weren\u2019t exactly co-operating; they were all competing for the meat. So, it was not like they could rely on each other to take on Han Sen in unison.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s murderous and intimidating presence stopped anyone or anything from harboring thoughts of potentially trying to attack or kill him.\n\n\u201cHaha!\u201d Yaksha, he who had been brutally beaten like so, suddenly laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Han Sen asked as he grabbed him by the loose and torn garments that still hung from Yaksha.\n\n\u201cMy spirit stone is not here, you fool! I\u2019ll respawn, should you kill me. And Xiang Yin? She\u2019s going to die. You were unable to save her. I may not have won, but you still lost. Isn\u2019t that so sad? Haha!\u201d Yaksha continued to laugh, as his other eyeball dropped from its socket. He actually seemed very happy."
