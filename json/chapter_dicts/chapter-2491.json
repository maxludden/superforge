    "text": "The longer he fought, the more confused Meng Lie became. Even if an ordinary deified xenogeneic wasn\u2019t very smart, it would still know to retreat when it was losing a fight. It wouldn\u2019t just relentlessly continue to attack a more powerful opponent.\n\nBut that kirin wanted a fight to the death no matter what. It didn\u2019t care for its life, which made it surprisingly difficult to counter. But the thing that concerned Meng Lie the most was the idea that someone was orchestrating all this. If that mysterious person could control deified xenogeneics, Meng Lie didn\u2019t want to imagine how strong they might be.\n\n\u201cI have to take Han Sen back to the Extreme King, and I have to do it fast.\u201d Meng Lie made his mind up. A gold substance chain exploded in a blinding burst of light. It was like a golden god tearing through space. Cloud airs and deified blood sprayed everywhere.\n\nBecause of the amount of raw power being exchanged, Han Sen couldn\u2019t get close to the fight. After ten hours, Han Sen heard the sound of something screaming, then silence. He turned as the headless body of the kirin slowly fell through the clouds.\n\nThen, Meng Lie was coming toward him. The man\u2019s hands were clutching the kirin\u2019s severed head. Meng Lie was injured, too, though. His golden god body was bleeding profusely, and one of his wounds was deep enough to show bone. He was quite damaged.\n\nHan Sen felt it was a shame that he hadn\u2019t been able to get the last hit in on the kirin, but he had managed to kill many King class xenogeneics during that time. He was slowly filling up his King class gene tallies, at least.\n\nHan Sen and Meng Lie kept traveling. Han Sen killed so many clouds beasts, but everywhere they went, even more of the crazed creatures showed up. Even Meng Lie, who was doing most of the killing, was getting tired hands.\n\n\u201cIf I find out who is behind all this, I\u2019m going to skin them alive,\u201d Meng Lie cursed in exhausted frustration.\n\nIn the past, xenogeneics never came close to Meng Lie. They wouldn\u2019t dare to show themselves before him. Right now, though, even Barons and Viscounts were willing to attack him. He killed them, but it was infuriating that he even had to.\n\nThey kept on fighting. The clouds looked like pools of blood in their wake. Meng Lie grabbed Han Sen and quickly outran the pursuing xenogeneics. He felt sick from the massive amount of killing he had done. He didn\u2019t want to kill anymore.\n\nAfter traveling one hundred thousand miles, they saw another deified xenogeneic coming for them. It appeared right in Meng Lie\u2019s path.\n\nHan Sen saw a huge, rainbow-colored bird that resembled a peacock. It was soaring through the clouds. Just the sensation of its presence would be enough to make most people cower in fear.\n\n\u201cThe Tianxia Peacock King! Who the hell could control the Tianxia Peacock King?\u201d Meng Lie whispered, his face going pale.\n\n\u201cIs he strong?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt is the fourth of Tianxia\u2019s seven gods. The Tianxia Unicorn is at last place on that roster. So, what do you think?\u201d Meng Lie looked sick. Clearly, he wasn\u2019t confident that he could defeat the Tianxia Peacock King in battle.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Tianxia Peacock King in shock. It fanned its beautiful feathers, raising them in a semicircle behind it.\n\nImages that looked like eyes stared out of the peacock\u2019s fanned feathers. All the colors of the rainbow glowed inside those eyes. They became rainbow godlights that suddenly drenched the entire sea of clouds in a rainbow godlight.\n\nThe moment the rainbow godlight appeared, Han Sen watched the light fall to touch his body. And when it happened, his armor, skin, and hair started to look like dust. He was too stunned to move.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Jadeskin was unable to block the rainbow godlights\u2019 power. Han Sen looked over at Meng Lie and saw that he, too, was melting into dust.\n\nWith a teeth-rattling roar, Meng Lie became that gold giant again. He grabbed Han Sen so that the gold color could spread across his body as well. The color dyed Han Sen\u2019s entire form.\n\nWhen Han Sen looked closer, he could see that the layer of gold was made of intricate substance chains. But even that layer of protection started to degrade under the power of the rainbow godlight. Meng Lie\u2019s gold body clearly couldn\u2019t withstand the Tianxia Peacock King\u2019s rainbow godlight.\n\n\u201cYou need to leave now.\u201d Meng Lie threw Han Sen away, then started running toward the Tianxia Peacock King.\n\nHan Sen used the momentum of Meng Lie\u2019s throw to escape the rainbow godlights\u2019 area of effect. The Tianxia Peacock King, meanwhile, was occupied by Meng Lie and therefore couldn\u2019t give chase.\n\n\u201cF*ck! Even the terrifying Tianxia Peacock King was drawn toward me. I can\u2019t keep this thing,\u201d Han Sen thought. He pulled the cloud out of Destiny\u2019s Tower, tossed it to the side, and flew away.\n\nThat thing had even managed to attract the Tianxia Peacock King. If Han Sen continued carrying it, it would only be a matter of time before he attracted the rest of the Tianxia gods.\n\nThe Tianxia Unicorn, at the end of the roster, was already so strong. The fourth rank god, the Tianxia Peacock King, must have been exceptionally scary. Even Meng Lie didn\u2019t underestimate a foe like that. If an enemy of a higher level came, they\u2019d be killed in no time at all.\n\nAfter Han Sen ditched the cloud, he turned back. He went in a different direction so he could escape Meng Lie.\n\nAfter flying for a while, Han Sen felt a weird prickling sensation across the back of his neck. He turned around and saw the cloud chasing him.\n\n\u201cOh sh*t! Why are you following me?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his skull. The thing hadn\u2019t stayed where he put it.\n\nThe cloud didn\u2019t answer Han Sen. It just flew over to him and floated nearby. It didn\u2019t seem to want to hurt him, though.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of you.\u201d Han Sen thought it was best to stay away from the strange cloud. He accelerated away, using his phoenix techniques as he fled.\n\nWhile that creamy cloud looked very slow, it somehow managed to keep up with Han Sen. No matter how many times Han Sen changed direction, he couldn\u2019t shake it off.\n\nHan Sen tried to punch it and send it flying away, but that didn\u2019t work for crap. The more strength he put into the blow, the faster the cloud would follow him. And when his punch landed on the cloud, it would become really thick and withstand all the force.\n\nAfter a short while of running, he met another group of cloud beasts. They were drawn to the cloud following Han Sen.\n\nFortunately, these cloud beasts were quite low-level. They were most Viscounts and Earls. Han Sen got rid of them easily.\n\n\u201cIf you bring me another deified, I will be very dead.\u201d There was nothing Han Sen could do to get rid of the cloud. He felt like crying.\n\nBut then Han Sen thought about it. The cloud\u2019s area of effect was limited. If he didn\u2019t run, no more powerful cloud beasts would show up.\n\nThinking of that, Han Sen stopped running. He stopped right where he was and glared at the cloud. He said to it, \u201cI\u2019m warning you. Don\u2019t follow me anymore. Otherwise, I will kill you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was trying to scare the black cricket or spider plant on the inside, as it was obvious that one of those two was behind the drama.\n\n\u201cYou really think I can\u2019t kill you?\u201d Han Sen demanded angrily when the cloud didn\u2019t react. He walked straight up to the occupants of the cloud."
