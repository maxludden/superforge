    "text": "The sounds coming from the cloud were something Han Sen had heard before. They were the same sounds that had accompanied Golden Growler\u2019s golden door.\n\nNo one knew what was beyond the golden door. Whatever was pulled inside it was dead, that much was certain. At least, no one was able to leave when pulled inside.\n\nWhen Han Sen was standing before the golden door, he had heard a weird sound. It was like an ancient god was praying or reading the chants of the Buddha.\n\nIt was just that Han Sen had not entered the door. He stood outside the golden door and listened, but it was never something clear.\n\nNow that he was trying to remember it, the sounds of the golden door were just like the sounds coming from the cloud. Han Sen just did not understand what the sounds meant.\n\nMany women loved shopping, even the three big singers, which included Feng Fei Fei. She was browsing around in the virtual community. She was different from ordinary women. She did not have to buy makeup products. She was in search of the eight sound bug.\n\nShe had been unable to get an eight sound bug from Night Cry Valley and could not be bothered going back there again. So, she planned on buying eight sound bugs online instead. She wanted to create gene medicine for bolstering her throat.\n\nShe searched for an eight sound bug and sorted the results by price from high to low. Feng Fei Fei did not care about shopping for a bargain. She wanted the best stuff, and that was that.\n\nA line of virtual products appeared before her. Feng Fei Fei was used to browsing prices from high to low, but she froze upon seeing the first item.\n\n\u201cMutant eight sound bug egg? Really?\u201d Feng Fei Fei clicked on the item. The photo of a mutant eight sound bug egg appeared. \u201cIt really is a mutant eight sound bug egg!\u201d Feng Fei Fei was very happy. In the virtual community, the shops scanned the real items. If there was a picture, one could bet their bottom dollar that it was genuine.\n\nWhen Feng Fei Fei looked at the price, she frowned. The price was placed at the maximum. It was a healthy sum of 9,999,999.\n\nA mutant eight sound bug egg was very rare, but it was just an earl class creature. That price was far too ridiculous to consider. Clearly, the shop keeper was not going to sell it properly.\n\n\u201cBoss, how are you selling the mutant eight sound bug egg?\u201d Feng Fei Fei asked after contacting the person running the shop. \u201cDear, the shop is selling it at the price listed. It is indeed available for purchase. You can feel free to order it at any time. We will have it delivered in 24 hours. If not, we\u2019ll pay you double.\u201d It was Jiang Shi. Mister Yang was in charge of running the shop, but Jiang Shi operated the customer services. She worked really hard. Even if she received complaints, she never got mad about it.\n\nJiang Shi and You You used to be slaves. Now, they followed Han Sen. He did not treat them like slaves. Jiang Shi was very grateful for that. She tried to do her best with whatever task Han Sen asked them to do.\n\n\u201cI really want to buy it, so give it to me at the price you truly want to sell it for,\u201d Feng Fei Fei said.\n\n\u201cDear, I really cannot sell it to you for a lower price,\u201d Jiang Shi quickly said. \u201cThat is as low as it can go. You can take a look at the other products in the shop if you would prefer. There are very economical viscount class eight sound bug eggs for sale. They are of good quality and fairly priced. Their abilities are great too.\u201d Those were the lines Mister Yang had taught her to say. She performed them very well.\n\nFeng Fei Fei looked around. She saw the shop was selling ordinary eight sound bug eggs. With her identity, the ordinary eight sound bug eggs did not really entice her.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to sell it sometime, why don\u2019t you send me a message? We can talk about the price some more.\u201d After saying that, Feng Fei Fei put the mutant eight sound bug egg in her shopping cart. \u201cAlright, dear,\u201d Jiang Shi replied.\n\nFeng Fei Fei was a bit depressed. She did not want to buy the mutant eight sound bug egg for herself. She wanted to send it to her little niece as a birthday gift.\n\nAlthough Feng Fei Fei had better sonic gene races, the level was too high. Her niece was too young. She could not combine with any high-level sonic gene races.\n\nThe mutant eight sound bug egg\u2019s level was not too high. Furthermore, it was a gene egg. If it hatched, it would be a baby. It did not tax the body too much, so it was suitable for a child. When the mutant eight sound bug egg grew up and had an ultimate body, it would be very good to improve one\u2019s voice. It would be even better than a marquise or duke class gene egg.\n\nAfter all, sonic gene races did not only improve one\u2019s voice. Mutant eight sound bugs did not do much in another direction. To improve one\u2019s voice, it was still a little bit worse than other sonic gene eggs.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame the seller does not plan on selling it.\u201d Feng Fei Fei looked at the shop\u2019s name. She planned to remember that the was shop called Shop.\n\nIn Gong Shu manor, a worker went to Gong Shu Jin\u2019s study. He bowed and said, \u201cMister, the results of my investigation are here for your perusal.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the worker pulled out a file of information he had been tasked to collect and put it down in front of Gong Shu Jin.\n\n\u201cGood job.\u201d Gong Shu Jin looked at the information and coldly said, \u201cA redneck that comes from Ancient God City, huh? He has no background. He has no faction. In that case, how dare he insult me, Gong Shu Jin? I must teach him a lesson. If I don\u2019t, he won\u2019t understand what it means for many nobles to be under a prince\u2019s feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, people like that do not deserve you to take action.\u201d The worker bowed and suggested, \u201cPerhaps you should send someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d Gong Shu Jin said. \u201cI will let you handle it. Remember, you must bring the mutant eight sound bug\u2019s body back complete. It will be Miss Fei Fei\u2019s birthday in a few days. I will give it to her as a birthday gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not worry, Mister, I will do all this very secretively,\u201d Lou Jiu said with very murderous eyes.\n\n\u201cMister, five of the eight sound bug eggs have already been sold. Each one has sold for 35,000, and there are lots of people asking for the price of the mutant eight sound bug egg.\u201d Mister Yang happily reported the results to Han Sen.\n\nTheir shop had only been open for a day, and they had already raked in a few sales. It was natural to feel ecstatic.\n\n\u201cGood job.\u201d Han Sen nodded. The mutant egg was not a small price for Mister Yang, but it meant nothing to Han Sen. He did not really care about it.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Mister, have you heard of one weird thing?\u201d Mister Yang tried to test him.\n\nHan Sen looked at Mister Yang and asked, \u201cWhat weird thing?\u201d\n\nMister Yang looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cIt was the seventh of the last month when the jade city had a big earthquake. The king\u2019s family\u2019s temple was destroyed. Someone saw that the temple had a gold beam of light shoot into space.\u201d\n\nMister Yang told him about this because the seventh day of the previous month was when he and Mister Meng had dug up Han Sen. He thought there was a connection between the two events.\n\n\u201cReally? Aren\u2019t earthquakes breaking big buildings normal?\u201d Han Sen quietly asked.\n\n\u201cMister, it is normal for other cities to have earthquakes, but the jade city is a space city that was man-made,\u201d Mister Yang said. \u201cWhy would there be earthquakes?\u201d After thinking for a moment, Han Sen asked, \u201cWhere is the king family\u2019s temple?\u201d \u201cMister, ordinary people cannot go there,\u201d Mister Yang quickly answered. \u201cThere are lots of elites guarding it. Only members of the royal family can go there to pay their respects. They usually do that at some festival.\u201d"
