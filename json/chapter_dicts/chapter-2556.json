Although many people sought to follow him, none of them sought trouble.\n\nThat was what depressed Han Sen, though. Not even the Demons came looking to start a fight. Han Sen wanted more of those Demon Dolls, and he wasn\u2019t getting another chance to procure one.\n\nThe next day, Han Sen decided to let Autumn Wind go. He didn\u2019t really need another person to pull the rickshaw for him, and if the Demon weren\u2019t going to come, there was no point in doing any of this.\n\n\u201cBrother Wind, you\u2019ve fulfilled your promise. You can leave now.\u201d\n\nAutumn Wind was actually pretty nice, so Han Sen didn\u2019t want to trouble him too much.\n\nAfter Autumn Wind heard this, he shook his head determinedly. He said, \u201cNo! No! Since I lost, I must uphold my end of the bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already pulled it all day. That\u2019s plenty,\u201d Han Sen replied with shock.\n\n\u201cOne day is not enough,\u201d Autumn Wind said. \u201cI have to help you and these two ladies for at least year. No, ten years! It is my pleasure to help you three out.\u201d\n\nJi Yang Sheng was so angry, and he thought to himself, \u201cYou are such an idiot. Why would you want to be a rickshaw boy?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Autumn Wind and said emotionlessly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need this rickshaw anymore. You may leave. Perhaps we will meet again one day.\u201d\n\nAutumn Wind still didn\u2019t look willing to leave. He said, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t need a rickshaw, there must be some other service I can do for you. I can hunt down xenogeneics and cook well. Let me work for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust go while we\u2019re letting you live. Stop talking crap!\u201d Elysian Moon said in annoyance.\n\nAutumn Wind sighed and said, \u201cIf you insist on me leaving, then I will. I hope I can see you both again someday.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Autumn Wind dropped the rope and departed. He kept looking back as he was leaving as if he didn\u2019t want to go. People would think that being a rickshaw boy had been a luxurious vacation for him, not an arduous task that he was conscripted into.\n\n\u201cThis Autumn Wind would do anything for pretty girls. What a player.\u201d Han Sen laughed. He knew that Autumn Wind was only there for Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng.\n\nAfter Autumn Wind left, Ji Yang Sheng saw Han Sen look at him. He thought to himself, \u201cLet me go\u2026 let me go\u2026 let me go now\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up and pull our rickshaw,\u201d Han Sen said with a cruel stare.\n\n\u201cF*ck!\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was furious. He wanted to slap Han Sen more than a few times, but all he could do was pull the carriage.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn a distant corner of a dark world, a dim light was shining amidst the old ruins of a palace.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, are you sure Little Sacred Leader can go to the sanctuaries now?\u201d Auntie Mei asked, looking at Nine Life Cat.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, you better think this through. If something happens to Little Sacred Leader, I will kill you,\u201d Old Vulture said to Old Cat with a fearsome gaze.\n\nOld Cat laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not wrong about this. Little Sacred Leader is going to be King class. This is the best time for him to earn genes in the sanctuaries. If he reaches King class, his self-cogwheel will be complete. Then, it will be too late for him to earn the genes he requires. He must reset his body\u2019s genes before he becomes King class, then he can use his self-cogwheel to become King class.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Little Sacred Leader is already a Duke. Are you sure it is safe for him to go to the sanctuaries?\u201d Auntie Mei asked.\n\n\u201cOthers might not fare well, but Little Sacred Leader won\u2019t have any trouble.\u201d Old Cat paused and then went on to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will be following behind Little Sacred Leader. I won\u2019t allow anything bad to happen to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better\u2026 Otherwise\u2026\u201d Auntie Mei coldly grunted.\n\nThose scary people said goodbye to Littleflower. Not long after, a man and a cat took a lantern with them as they left the ruins. They ventured out into the darkness.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, I want to see my mother,\u201d Littleflower said to Old Cat. He was holding the lantern as he walked.\n\n\u201cOf course. You can now go anywhere, but you must know that your mother loves you so much. When you are back, she will want to keep you and not allow you to go anywhere. But this world is going to end, and when that happens, your mother, family, and friends will all die. If you don\u2019t level up and save all of existence, then your mother and your father will leave you. Even your cute sister will die. You saw the video of her, right? Do you really want them to be killed?\u201d Old Cat said.\n\n\u201cOnly I can save the world? Is there no other way?\u201d Littleflower asked, looking at Old Cat.\n\n\u201cYes, you are the savior of this world. Only you can save everybody,\u201d the Old Cat answered seriously.\n\n\u201cFine. We will go to the sanctuaries. I won\u2019t let my parents or my sister get hurt. I will save the world.\u201d Littleflower\u2019s face looked certain of this.\n\n\u201cYes. Just like that. Save the world, and then you can be with your family,\u201d the Old Cat said with a nod and a blink.\n\nStanding in the First God\u2019s Sanctuary, Tang Ming\u2019er happily clutched her knife and rushed forward. She headed for the fields, wanting to kill creatures. She had just turned sixteen, and this was her first time in the sanctuaries, but the weird thing was, the shelter she resided in was empty. She was the only person there.\n\nThat didn\u2019t matter to Tang Ming\u2019er, though. She had the Tang family\u2019s positive personality, and she was confident in her abilities. She didn\u2019t care if there was no one there. She just wanted to kill creatures quickly.\n\nAfter running for a short while, she saw two creatures running across the fields. Tang Ming\u2019er was happy about this. She sprinted toward them with her z-steel knife.\n\nBut when Tang Ming\u2019er drew close, she was given a fright. The two creatures were a twelve-year-old boy and a beast that resembled a cat.\n\nThe boy had red lips and white teeth. He was beautiful, and he looked like a human.\n\nPeople couldn\u2019t enter the sanctuaries until they were sixteen, though. If they entered before their sixteenth birthday, their bodies would be damaged. With that in mind, he couldn\u2019t have been a human.\n\n\u201cAre you a human or what?\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er asked, raising her knife as she drew close to the boy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m human. You\u2019re a human too, right, big sister?\u201d Littleflower looked at Tang Ming\u2019er with curiosity. He hadn\u2019t seen another human in years.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er felt relieved to hear he was a human, but she didn\u2019t think that could be true. She pulled out her knife and pointed it at Littleflower. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. Humans can only enter the sanctuaries when they are sixteen. You are so small. How did you enter the sanctuaries before that?\u201d\n\nLittleflower was about to respond when he heard something tearing its way out of the soil. Grass and dirt fountained up, and a ten-meter-long centipede came out of the ground. It was going to attack Tang Ming\u2019er and Littleflower.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er\u2019s face went pale. She picked up Littleflower and ran toward her shelter.\n\nBefore she entered the sanctuaries, she had read about the creatures that lived there. She immediately knew this was a sacred-blood demon centipede. She had just entered the sanctuaries, and so she couldn\u2019t beat it."
