But he didn\u2019t speak to her much while he was practicing. When they did talk, Li Keer would either tell Han Sen about God\u2019s Wander or answer questions about herself.\n\n\u201cThis person is a fighting freak like Lone Bamboo.\u201d Li Keer had grown a little depressed as they traveled. She planned to take Han Sen as her silkworm, but after spending so much time with him, she realized that there was nothing Han Sen really needed from her. She couldn\u2019t even bring herself to tell him that she was one of the Very High.\n\nLi Keer regretted this. If she had known this was going to happen, she would have told him she was one of the Very High the first time they met. That way, they could have had a more serious discussion, at least. If she revealed her identity now, Li Keer didn\u2019t think it would amount to much. It wasn\u2019t right, she thought. She would even feel lower than Han Sen.\n\nAfter Li Keer finished teaching God\u2019s Wander to Han Sen, she wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity to reveal her identity and convince him to go with her.\n\n\u201cI still have some matters to take care of. We will meet again if fate bids our paths to cross once more,\u201d Han Sen quickly said goodbye to Li Keer and departed the core area. He returned to the white whale.\n\nLi Keer was so upset that she wanted to kick something. She looked so sad when she returned to her ship.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, what happened? Did you tell Dollar? Did he agree to be your silkworm?\u201d Little Butterfly asked, looking at Li Keer with confusion.\n\nLi Keer sighed and said nothing. She didn\u2019t want to admit that she had missed an opportunity to reveal that she was one of the Very High.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, what is going on? Why are the rumors saying Dollar is one of the Very High? What happened?\u201d Little Butterfly hastily asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I will claim him.\u201d Li Keer felt annoyed and just waved her hand to indicate she wanted no more questions.\n\n\u201cDollar, you must become my silkworm.\u201d Li Keer nibbled her lips in anger.\n\nHan Sen returned to the white whale and was shocked to find out what had happened in his absence.\n\nFang Qing Yu and the pirates were hiding in a corner, and Ning Yue was curled up behind Bao\u2019er. She was very scared, but Bao\u2019er was holding the purple ginseng that looked like a big carrot. She chewed on it as she stood in front of the others.\n\nInside the control room, Gu Qingcheng was fighting Elysian Moon. What surprised Han Sen was that they were both using area powers.\n\n\u201cHow did they level up so quickly?\u201d Han Sen wondered. \u201cThey are already King class.\u201d\n\nAlthough he had given Gu Qingcheng some xenogeneic genes, she and Elysian Moon had become King class much more quickly than he expected. And they were using area powers. That was a bit much.\n\nThat was especially true of Elysian Moon. She had spent less time in the geno universe. There was no way she could have leveled up this quickly.\n\nThe white whale\u2019s control room had become their battleground. Gu Qingcheng stood there with loads of swords coming out of her. All those flying swords were like a river headed for Elysian Moon.\n\nElysian Moon opened her umbrella that was made of paper. The flying swords, upon hitting the umbrella, were sucked into the drawing on the umbrella\u2019s surface. More and more flying swords appeared on the drawing.\n\nElysian Moon spun her white paper umbrella, making the flying swords inside the canvas come back to life. Now under Elysian Moon\u2019s control, the flying swords flew forward to strike back at Gu Qingcheng.\n\nGu Qingcheng frowned. Her area power was put to work again. She regained control of the swords and sent them back at Elysian Moon.\n\nThe two pretty girls were having a stand-off, with one holding a sword and the other holding an umbrella. A storm of swords flew back and forth between them. It was like there was no end in sight.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing? Why are they fighting?\u201d Han Sen asked, after jumping over in front of Bao\u2019er.\n\nEveryone other than Bao\u2019er shook their heads. Clearly, they didn\u2019t know why Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were fighting, either. They were also shocked about how fast Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon had leveled up.\n\nBao\u2019er was clutching her purple ginseng when she answered, \u201cThey are fighting about which is bigger and which is smaller.\u201d\n\n\u201cBigger and smaller? What does that mean?\u201d Han Sen asked in confusion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard them fighting. Gu Qingcheng said she wants to be big, but Elysian Moon said no. She said Gu Qingcheng can be small, and she can be the big one,\u201d Bao\u2019er explained, not seeming to understand it herself.\n\nUpon hearing that, knowing expressions crossed the faces of the pirates. \u201cI know. They both must have fallen in love with the same man. So, they both want to be with that man. But they are fighting about which will be the mistress and which will be the wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right; things must be like that. I\u2019d like to know which man is so lucky to have two pretty girls fighting over him.\u201d\n\n\u201cA family must have been storing up luck for generations for a man to have these two women. I can\u2019t imagine what he did in a past life to earn this. Maybe he saved the universe or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaving the universe once wouldn\u2019t be enough. He must have done it twice, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. That man must have been a virgin for ten generations, and that was how he was gifted two women like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was able to marry them both, I would be satisfied to live with them as my wives for one day before dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to just die on top of their bellies?\u201d\n\nThe pirates were now caught in a firestorm of discussion. They all wanted to be the man that Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon liked.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked very similar. They were both beautiful to an almost disaster-inducing degree. The pirates loved them. If Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon weren\u2019t Han Sen\u2019s friends, the pirates and the Extreme King knights would have been hitting on them night and day. They\u2019d probably fight for them, too.\n\nWhen Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon heard what the pirates were saying, they became even angrier. Gu Qingcheng turned to stare at the men. The swords of the pirates suddenly flew out of their scabbards. Under Gu Qingcheng\u2019s control, they flew toward their masters.\n\n\u201cGu Qingcheng! Elysian Moon! Stop!\u201d Han Sen reached out his hand to absorb all the swords. All of the swords writhed like snakes, trying to escape Han Sen\u2019s grasp, but they were unable to.\n\nUpon hearing Han Sen, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon stopped. They coldly stared at the pirates, who then felt a chill. They quietly stepped back.\n\n\u201cYou both come with me.\u201d Han Sen took Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng to his office.\n\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on. Why are you two fighting?\u201d Han Sen sat on the office chair and looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.\n\n\u201cWe are going to die.\u201d Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked at each other and said the same thing to Han Sen. He stared at them in stunned silence."
