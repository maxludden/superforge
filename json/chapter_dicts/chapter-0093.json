    "text": "But half an hour later, Son of Heaven\u2019s face became a bit stiff as Han Sen was still fiercely brandishing the katana at the same speed.\n\n\"Son of Heaven, didn\u2019t you say that Dollar would be worn out in half an hour? I\u2019m telling you my Dad was right. Men are better than women,\" Qing said proudly.\n\nLooking at Son of Heaven\u2019s grim face, Yuan smiled and did not speak.\n\nSon of Heaven was really upset. According to common sense, Dollar would not last half an hour. With that kind of strikes, few in First God\u2019s Sanctuary could.\n\n\"Ahem. It seems that Dollar has practiced some special hyper geno art that improves his stamina. Even so, he couldn\u2019t possibly last an hour. In another half an hour, he would be worn down.\" Son of Heaven wanted to restore some authority of his.\n\n\"Son of Heaven, you are a guy. Why do you keep cheering for a woman? My Dad says that men are the best. I think Dollar must be better than that woman. You have no vision.\" Qing obviously did not agree with Son of Heaven's argument.\n\nSon of Heaven almost choked. Pretending to be calm, he said, \"Qing, if you don\u2019t believe me, keep on watching. In half an hour, you will know who is right. I\u2019m just stating the fact here.\"\n\n\"Is there any need to watch? Dollar will certainly have no problem. He killed a golden-horned Shura. Why will he lose to a woman?\" Qing said with open worship in his eyes.\n\nSon of Heaven did not say anything, considering argument with such a kid unnecessary. In a while the kid will see what is good judgment.\n\nBut another half an hour had passed, and Dollar\u2019s spirit was still high. There was no sign of him burning out at all, which made Son of Heaven uncomfortable as if he had just swallowed a fly.\n\nQing was very pleased and patted Son of Heaven on the shoulder, \"Son of Heaven, what did I tell you? Men can\u2019t be weaker than women. A man that can\u2019t beat a woman is not a man. It\u2019s been an hour and Dollar is still fierce. I believe that woman will be beat in a while. You need to learn from me so that you can have better judgment. Remember to take men\u2019s side instead of women\u2019s.\"\n\nSon of Heaven was seething with anger. He pretended not having heard Qing and kept silent.\n\n\"Right, Son of Heaven, why didn\u2019t you enter the final. Who did you lose to? Dollar?\" Qing wasn\u2019t even aware of Son of Heaven\u2019s emotions and kept asking him.\n\n\"How could I lose to that guy?\" Son of Heaven immediately said coldly.\n\n\"Who did you lose to then?\" Qing asked.\n\nSon of Heaven felt his own face was burning. He lost to the woman on the stage, but it wasn\u2019t time to tell Qing that.\n\nKnowing that Son of Heaven had lost to Qin Xuang, Yuan almost laughed out loud. He pulled the sleeve of Qing and asked, \"Are you here to talk or to watch the game?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s only fun to discuss the game while we watch,\" Qing retorted.\n\n\"Fun for you. Son of Heaven was about to be set on fire,\" Yuan glanced at Son of Heaven\u2019s sullen face and thought.\n\nDispleased, Son of Heaven felt strange. \"Dollar has been wielding the weapon so fiercely that it\u2019s impossible for him to keep going for such a long time. Unless he has also practiced Atomic Fission.\"\n\nOther than Son of Heaven, Qin Xuan felt something was off as well. Attacking at such a high speed, Dollar had sustained way longer than she had expected, making her alarmed and surprised.\n\nIn such a high-intensity duel, even she had begun to feel a little tired. Dollar, however, seemed to feel nothing and kept attacking with the katana swiftly, as if he could do this forever, giving birth to a trace of powerlessness in Qin Xuan\u2019s mind.\n\n\"No, I cannot go on like this. He must have also practiced some hyper geno art that enhances his stamina. Maybe I will be the one who is worn out first\u2026\" Qin Xuan gritted her teeth and dodged another strike. She took back her dagger and two beast souls appeared in the air.\n\nOne beast soul was the mutant golden lion that she had always used. She instantaneously shapeshifted into a magnificent golden lion.\n\nAnd the other beast soul was a ball of blue liquid, which poured into the lion and turned its golden body blue. The lion also grew larger and looked fiercer.\n\n\"That is sacred-blood water spirit! Qin Xuan actually got its beast soul!\" Son of Heaven was shocked to see that. He knew very well how scary a sacred-blood water spirit was. It could coexist with another creature and make that creature exceptionally strong.\n\nQin Xuan made the final attack to the water spirit when she was hunting it with Son of Heaven, who did not know she got the beast soul. It seemed that the beast soul had the same power as the creature it once belonged to.\n\nWith the help of water spirit beast soul, the mutant golden lion had become stronger than normal sacred-blood creatures. Qin Xuan could then fully display the power of Atomic Fission.\n\nSon of Heaven was surprised. \"Qin Xuan has become so strong. It seems that this year she could be among top 3 of the Chosen.\"\n\nHan Sen knew Qin Xuan really well. He glanced at her expression and knew something was off. Just before she summoned the water spirit beast soul, he summoned his wings and flew up high.\n\nEveryone was stunned, including Qin Xuan. Who could have thought Dollar who looked like he was going for mutual destruction had flown away the minute Qin Xuan shapeshifted.\n\nQin Xuan who had shapeshifted did not know what to do. These two beast souls were fierce enough for sure. Even Dollar used a sacred-blood shapeshifting beast soul she could beat him.\n\nShe chose the moment when Han Sen was making the most powerful strikes to shapeshift so that he wouldn\u2019t disengage himself. She didn\u2019t have sacred-blood wings, so she wanted to end the match as soon as possible.\n\nWhat she did not think of was that Dollar who was chasing her just flew away faster than rabbits.\n\nQin Xuan suddenly felt very embarrassed. As fierce as she was right now, she could not fly and as a lion, she could no longer use weapons, so she couldn\u2019t even throw things at Han Sen."
