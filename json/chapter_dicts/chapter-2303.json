    "text": "\u201cBai Wuchang has a strange personality, so Father never planned on letting him succeed to the throne. He still loves him dearly, of course. Bai Wuchang is the only one who has never recruited guards for fighting, but Father still provides him resources in order to level up,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\n\u201cHe takes care of him that much? Won\u2019t the other sons and daughter get jealous?\u201d Han Sen asked with shock.\n\n\u201cThey are more than just jealous, but none of them can do anything about it. Father is indeed biased toward Bai Wuchang, and he is the son of the empress. The crown prince is his big brother from the same parents. Even though he was just a student of a national teacher, others have to think very carefully before risking a fight with him,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\n\u201cWho is the national teacher?\u201d Han Sen did not know much about the internal workings of Extreme King society.\n\n\u201cHis name is Gu Yuan.\u201d When Bai Wei said the name, she lowered her voice. It looked as if talking about him made her uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear more about him later. Anyway, just don\u2019t accept Bai Wuchang\u2019s challenge no matter what you do,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on fighting him, anyway.\u201d Han Sen shrugged and laughed. There was no way he was going to accept a challenge that had been presented to him in that fashion. It would just be a waste of time.\n\nBai Wei sighed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ve finished all the paperwork, so let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAs they left the space station and headed down towards The Grave of Soldiers and Kings, a woman sat in the control room, watching Han Sen and Bai Wei through a camera feed.\n\nThe woman was extremely pretty. Just seeing her sitting there was enough to bring people a feeling of happiness.\n\nShe might not have been as beautiful as women like Fox Queen, but she looked so cold and so smart. It was impressive. It was like everything in the world was reflected in her lake-like eyes.\n\nThe space station\u2019s captain stood next to the woman. He leaned over her and said in a flirty voice, \u201cMiss Mirror, you can tell me anything. I will do whatever it is you wish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to stay here quietly. Can I, captain?\u201d the woman answered with a smile.\n\n\u201cOf course\u2026 of course\u2026 What are you guys waiting for? Get out! Hurry, hurry! Move faster!\u201d The captain quickly kicked out every worker that was present in the control room.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror, is there anything else?\u201d After the captain kicked out all the workers, he stood in front of the woman, smiling obsequiously.\n\nThe woman only looked at the captain\u2019s smile. She did not say anything.\n\nThe captain\u2019s face fell slightly as he registered what she meant by this. He walked back towards the door, smiled, and bowed. \u201cPlease rest, Miss Mirror. I will stop disturbing you\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter he went out the door, the captain carefully shut it behind him without making the slightest sound. He did not want to disturb the woman.\n\nThe woman was the only one left in the control room. She sat there elegantly, but she was too focused to look casual. She was the prime example of what it was to look like a woman.\n\n\u201cBai Wei, Bai Wei; why are you doing this?\u201d The woman looked at Bai Wei who was headed to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings. She sighed and shook her head.\n\nNot long after, the woman turned her attention to Han Sen, who was traveling alongside Bai Wei.\n\nAfter a while, she spoke to herself. \u201cNarrow Moon\u2019s Knife Queen finally took a student. He practiced in Sky Palace for a few years. He returned to Narrow Moon when he became a Marquise, and then he became a back-up knight for the Ice Blue Knights in the systems of chaos. He received a deified feather from Kong Fei. His circumstances have been favorable, but he has poor potential. The crystallizers are a lowly race that rely on the powers of others. Their own powers are weak, and their genes are no good. It is difficult for them to become deified. It may feel nice for Bai Wei to have someone with her, but using him as a Royal Guard will be way too much effort for the lackluster returns.\u201d\n\nHan Sen followed Bai Wei to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings. The entire planet was a graveyard, and headstones sprouted from the ground everywhere they looked.\n\nBut what was buried in the earth were not creatures or beings; they were xenogeneic weapons.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t really interested in those xenogeneic weapons. He already had a deified Thunder God Spike and his Ghost Teeth Knife. He really wasn\u2019t interested in ordinary treasure weapons.\n\nHe would much rather find a deified-class beast soul.\n\nXenogeneic weaponry like the deified-class Thunder God Spike wasn\u2019t very useful for Han Sen. Instead of attacking, it could only leave a paralytic effect on a King or a half-deified being, and that was about it.\n\nAnd if the Thunder God Spike wasn\u2019t wielded by a King class elite, its effects would be dramatically weakened.\n\nHan Sen and the others landed on the plaza of The Grave of Soldiers and Kings. Nine bronze grave beasts lined each side of the plaza. The moment Han Sen stepped onto the plaza, the eighteen bronze beasts came alive.\n\nThey didn\u2019t look as if they were going to attack Han Sen and Bai Wei, though. They opened their mouths, then each of the beasts spat a weapon out onto the plaza.\n\nThe eighteen weapons were each different, and they all sat in front of their respective grave beast.\n\nBai Wei was in battle mode already, and she said to Han Sen, \u201cEach of these weapons will attack us once. We have to use our power to repel each strike. If we do that, we will be qualified to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings to collect a weapon. We aren\u2019t allowed to use any xenogeneic treasures. If we do, it is counted as a failure.\u201d\n\nAs Bai Wei spoke, a lance gathered up a frightening amount of power. A black flame wreathed the weapon, as if a fiery demon was holding the lance. It came thrusting at Han Sen and Bai Wei.\n\n\u201cI will block the first nine attacks, while you block the last nine attacks,\u201d Bai Wei said, preparing the intercept the lance\u2019s attack.\n\nBut Han Sen stepped forward in front of Bai Wei, smiled, and said, \u201cLet me go first. When I cannot hold on anymore, you can take over with your attack.\u201d\n\nAs the lance flew toward them like a demonic dragon, Han Sen summoned Jadeskin. He threw his fist against the tip of the lance.\n\nThe woman in the control room frowned as she saw Han Sen send a punch toward the lance. \u201cThe eighteen-weapon test isn\u2019t solely for testing the power of the royal children. It also teaches them that different powers require unique responses. That is the only way to pass the test. Han Sen is just fighting fire with fire. Even if he manages to destroy the lance\u2019s attack, his own power will be damaged, too. When he tries to withstand the attacks of the other weapons, the strain will become harder and harder for him. He is strong, but he lacks a brain. A reckless man like this, well, I have no idea how he managed to earn the same title as Lone Bamboo.\u201d\n\nAs the woman\u2019s attention flicked back to the screen, Han Sen\u2019s fist had already collided with the demonic dragon lance\u2019s tip. The fist and the spike came against each other.\n\nBoom!\n\nUnder the force of that punch, the demonic dragon\u2019s body was crushed. It became dust, scattering everywhere."
