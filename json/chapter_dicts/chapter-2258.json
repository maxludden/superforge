Why are they here?\u201d Han Sen reacted immediately, directing Little Star to dive back into the dark river.\n\nBefore Little Star escaped beneath the dark waters, Han Sen felt a frightening wash of power come for him. Within one second, the river was vaporized into nothing.\n\nHan Sen summoned his Demon Bug King Bai Sema to block that frightening attack, but the shield was damaged so much that it cracked. It was on the precipice of shattering completely.\n\nFortunately, Edward didn\u2019t really want to kill Han Sen until they knew if he was carrying the relic. If they killed him right where he was, and he didn\u2019t have the relic on him, there was a chance they\u2019d never find it. If they had simply wanted him dead, then the Demon Bug King Bai Sema wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive their attack. It would have broken.\n\nEven so, the Demon Bug King Bai Sema could no longer be used. So, Han Sen put it back in his Sea of Soul.\n\nAfter Han Sen blocked the initial attack, Little Star ran into the stone to try to escape.\n\nBut that stone wasn\u2019t enough to stop Edward. A scary power enveloped him, and the rocks were torn asunder in a path that extended a thousand meters ahead. Crime ran forward as well, waving his fists.\n\nHan Sen guided Little Star onto a different route. It looked like their pursuers had enough power to accomplish anything. The underground rocks were like bubbles to them. One punch could cleave a thousand-meter trench through the stone. Wherever Han Sen went, they could catch up with him quickly.\n\nIt was like they had placed a tracking device on Han Sen. Even though he and Little Star were keeping ahead of them, he could never truly shake their hot-heeled pursuit.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, this matter doesn\u2019t concern you! Give me the item, and you can be allowed to live,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cThe item is mine. Why do I have to give it to you?\u201d Han Sen asked as he continued his flight. The stone plate was not theirs by any right, so Han Sen had no plans of returning it to them\u2014not in the least.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the option of keeping the item. If you want to live, you have to give it up. Do you want to live? Or do you want to die because of it?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said.\n\n\u201cI want to live, but I also want the item,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBecause Edward wasn\u2019t willing to send a lethal strike after Han Sen, the rocks were still shielding him adequately. So, Han Sen could evade capture for the time being.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t keep running like that forever. Han Sen gritted his teeth and let Little Star take him back to the palace.\n\nFox Queen was so angry. She was still grinding her teeth when she suddenly heard a loud noise. She turned to see Han Sen and Little Star bursting back out of the fish\u2019s mouth.\n\nHan Sen looked at Fox Queen, who was just gazing back at him. He smiled awkwardly, \u201cPretty lady, I have been thinking\u2026 I miss you so much, I couldn\u2019t help but return.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox Queen saw him, a frown crossed her face. It was as if she was trying to hear something, but she eventually squinted and smiled back at Han Sen. \u201cIt looks like you have offended many people. They are already right outside the palace. And they are certainly quite strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, those are not of any importance. You can feel free to ignore those guys. They cannot break through the restrictions of this place, anyway. Pretty lady, should we carry on with our kissing game?\u201d Han Sen said with a cough.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to play it now. I want to play something more exciting.\u201d Fox Queen waved her hand, and invisible cords of power lashed around Han Sen and Little Star. She hung them from one of the high beams of the palace, upside-down.\n\nFox Queen gripped a whip and approached the hanging Han Sen and Little Star. She stroked Han Sen\u2019s cheek and smiled. \u201cYou gave me a big surprise earlier. How should I repay you?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen raised her little whip. Han Sen hastily pled, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Pretty Lady! We should talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only want to do this. I don\u2019t want to talk!\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s pretty face looked cold.\n\nShe used to be so strong in the geno universe. She had been known as a powerful negotiator, and even negotiating with deified elites didn\u2019t put her at a disadvantage. She absolute hated Han Sen, and she now wanted to teach him a lesson more than ever.\n\nAs they spoke, Fox Queen raised the whip in her hands. She wanted to give him a deep lesson to vent some of her frustration.\n\n\u201cPretty Lady! Let us strike a bargain. I will help you escape this place, and then there will be no reason for a grudge between us,\u201d Han Sen quickly said.\n\nFox Queen was shocked. She would have rolled her eyes if Han Sen had made this offer before, but he had just proven his ability to escape the palace. Now, she was starting to believe him.\n\n\u201cAre you playing games with me again?\u201d Fox Queen smiled, but her eyes looked frighteningly cold.\n\n\u201cIf I lie to you, Big Sister, I will go straight down to hell,\u201d Han Sen frantically swore.\n\nFox Queen smiled, and she brushed Han Sen\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cSuch a good brother, always happy to give me surprises. How could I possibly let you die?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen\u2019s smile turned cruel. The whip in her hand straightened like a spike. And then, Fox Queen used it to stab.\n\nThe spiky whip pierced through Han Sen\u2019s pants, almost catching the family jewels as it went through. It slammed into the wall behind Han Sen, and the lower half of his body turned to ice.\n\n\u201cIf you lie to me again, I am going to make a eunuch out of you.\u201d Fox Queen grunted coldly, then returned to the jade bed. She settled herself and looked at Han Sen. \u201cTell me, how are you going to help me escape?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Edward looked at the wall in wonder.\n\nThey had chased Han Sen deeper and deeper into the planet, clearing away the rocks as they went. But once they reached that point, they were unable to break the stone anymore.\n\nEven Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s power could only trigger small puffs of black air. The stone wall could not be damaged.\n\nEdward began destroying all the stone that he could still break, and they quickly realized that it was an underground stone palace. Even their combined powers couldn\u2019t harm it.\n\n\u201cI believe that Han Sen is hiding inside this stone palace. That is why my power is unable to tell us where he is,\u201d Mister White said, as he stared at the stone palace.\n\n\u201cMister White, is there a way we can gain access to the stone palace?\u201d Edward asked politely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good with things like this. You would have a better chance of breaking through than I would.\u201d Mister White shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who constructed this stone palace, but even our own power isn\u2019t enough to break through its perimeter. One thing is for sure, though: whoever built it must have been a deified elite,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said.\n\n\u201cOpening the palace with brute force is impossible. If we dig up the entire stone palace, we might be able to find an entrance, though,\u201d Edward quietly said.\n\nThey had no choice. If they were to find an entrance, they had to dig up the entire palace.\n\nHan Sen had only come in and out of the palace via the waterway. He didn\u2019t know where the main entrance was, either."
