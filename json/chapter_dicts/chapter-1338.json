It confirmed to him that the pill was genuine and that it would have helped him open the special gene lock. The nature of that lock, however, was a different question entirely.\n\nHe paid extra attention to Bao\u2019er following this, but he did not notice any changes in her behavior or abilities. It was exactly the same thing that occurred to Han Sen himself, following his opening of the Life Door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay,\u201d Han Sen told her, with much relief. He hadn\u2019t wanted to endanger her.\n\nHan Sen then spent most of his time practicing the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He had settled on becoming a demi-god once he opened its tenth gene lock.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t worried about his absence in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. He had done the best he could, with the ploy of crafting a contract signed by him and The King. He didn\u2019t think the spirits would violate the contract once he left. The territory he had established for humans was only one million miles squared, so it wasn\u2019t all that much, anyway. And besides, Han Sen had a number of super creatures and emperors that would remain when he was gone. They\u2019d help protect everything Han Sen had done, and Queen and Qin Xuan had become exemplary surpassers in the time that had passed since their coming to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nOne year later, he finally managed to crack open the last gene lock of the Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nWhen the tenth gene lock opened, it made his body far tougher. It wasn\u2019t particularly brilliant in any individual capacity, but it was good to have it finished.\n\nHe didn\u2019t mind it being underwhelming for himself, as his desire for advancing the Blood-Pulse Sutra had shifted in recent years. His focus with it, much like the members of Blood Legion, was to ensure his heirs would be stronger. It wasn\u2019t for himself; it was for the future generations of his lineage.\n\nAnd once that was done, he didn\u2019t have much else to do. He was going to become a demi-god, but he was in no immediate rush to. He made sure to spend a lot more time with his mother and with Ji Yanran after this.\n\nThe Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, the world of demi-gods, was completely different than all else that had come before. Old Man Ji had told him it was just the beginning.\n\nHan Sen had received the bulk of what he knew about the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary from Old Man Ji himself. He wasn\u2019t going to underestimate the realm he would soon be stepping into.\n\nThe Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary was still a world of creatures and spirits, but they started very much like humans did there. They started from scratch.\n\nThe shelters there were all individual and separate from one another. Each shelter had a Demi-God Geno Core, and to conquer a shelter, one had to claim the Demi-God Geno Core.\n\nAfter a human became a demi-god, their own Demi-God Geno Core would increase in strength the more geno points they collected.\n\nUnfortunately for humans, they now also had to play by the rules spirits did. If spirits sought to invade a shelter a human possessed, they could claim the human\u2019s Demi-God Geno Core as humans did their spirit stones in previous shelters.\n\nDemi-God Geno Cores generated different types of powers. Old Man Ji informed Han Sen he\u2019d be stronger than the average starter demi-god, but he also made sure to warn Han Sen not to overestimate his abilities. He\u2019d still be very vulnerable, stepping into that world.\n\nThe demi-god creatures that had geno cores would be lethal for humans to try to do battle with.\n\nThe powers of a geno core were wild and unpredictable, as well. They came in all varieties, and if your attention lapsed, you could be killed by a geno core without even knowing how you died.\n\nHan Sen listened to Old Man Ji intently, but ultimately, how he\u2019d start off was down to luck. It\u2019d be a roll of the dice.\n\nMost humans used evolution pools to ascend a sanctuary, and the same still held true for entering the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary from the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. Becoming a demi-god was easy for humans.\n\nBut few humans could become a demi-god the proper way, and going there without maxing out their geno points and making sure they were the best they could be would ensure a swift death.\n\nEven humans who maxed out their genes were susceptible to the fickle nature of fate. Unfortunately, luck still played a large role in their ascendance to the next sanctuary.\n\nMankind discovered sanctuaries two hundred years ago, but even after all that time, there were only one hundred demi-gods.\n\nLike the Xuan Men successor he once encountered, Han Sen wanted to traverse The Ten Steps of the Holy Door.\n\nBut his success there would also subject him to the picky throes of luck, when he came out the other side and spawned. But as long as he didn\u2019t wind up spawning next to a strong creature or spirit, he figured he\u2019d be okay.\n\nWhen he did leave for the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, though, he wasn\u2019t sure when he could return. As such, he made sure to spend as much time with Ji Yanran as possible. They went to a lot of places and experienced many new adventures together, to forge lasting memories that would accompany Han Sen after he made the jump.\n\nIf he was unable to find a shelter, he would be unable to return at all.\n\nAfter another four months elapsed, though, he was ready. He prepared himself for walking up the fabled stairway.\n\nAfter a fond farewell to his friends and companions, with whom he had accomplished much, it was time for him to go. And when it was, he took off towards the Endless Sea mostly alone.\n\nThe spirits weren\u2019t aware that Han Sen was leaving, so they were going to remain in order and adhere to the contract. With things still like that, he had now done everything he could for the humans of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHan Sen brought the silver fox, Bao\u2019er, Little Angel, and Golden Growler with him. While he was unsure at first, he also decided to bring Moment Queen. He would have liked to bring others with him, but they\u2019d die if they could not withstand the searing flames of the steps.\n\nHan Sen had decided to bring Moment Queen with him because he still had reservations regarding her goodwill towards humans. He still believed he had to keep the leash on her, to avoid her doing something evil once he was gone.\n\nThe stronger Han Sen was, the stronger the fire would be, too. His companions were sure to have a hard time following him up.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even plan to bring Bao\u2019er or the silver fox with him at first, either. But they suspected what he was going to do, and nothing he did would remove them from his company. Han Sen thought if the Xuan Men successor was able to bring a skeleton up with him, then he wouldn\u2019t have too much trouble bringing his super creature companions.\n\nLittle Angel and Golden Growler were staples of Han Sen\u2019s collection. They had always been with him, and he wasn\u2019t going to leave them behind now. They had ten gene locks open as well, anyway. Considering their abilities, even with sentimentality out of the picture, he really wanted to bring them with him.\n\nHan Sen gave out the rest of his beast souls to his mother and Ji Yanran, so they\u2019d have a fair amount of decent gear and weaponry to get a headstart in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHe also tasked Xie Qing King and a few of the others with keeping an extra eye out for those two, to ensure nothing bad would befall them. With the underground shelter and the Life Geno Essences they had been gifted, though, it didn\u2019t seem likely they could be bullied."
