    "text": "\u201cOld Vulture, what happened outside? Why has the darkness around the holy palace lessened considerably?\u201d In the darkest corner of the palace, a beast, which looked completely red had an eye that resembled a purgatory abyss, looked at the dark sky.\n\nOn the roof, a giant beast, which had no eyes, asked, \u201cIs your eye going funny? How can Sacred be bright?\u201d\n\nA weird, pitch-black bird stared at the darkness and said, \u201cThings really do look brighter.\u201d It turned and spoke to a pretty woman. \u201cYou old horny woman, do you see what is out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fine for you to call me a horny woman, but I will rip your head off if you call me old again.\u201d After the pretty woman said that, she peered into the faraway darkness.\n\n\u201cWeird, things do appear brighter. What is going on?\u201d Auntie Mei was surprised.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be my eye going funny. The darkness around the holy hall is much weaker. Something must have happened in Sacred. It must be something huge.\u201d The angry red beast started to move. It seemed as if he wanted to go outside to take a look at what might be going on.\n\n\u201cSomething big? So, what if it is big? Those God Spirits wouldn\u2019t come here. What other creature could make changes to Sacred?\u201d Auntie Mei had a look of disdain. She sighed and said, \u201cLittle Master has been gone for so long. Why has he yet to come back? Do you think something might have happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou horny woman, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d the eyeless big beast said. \u201cWith Little Master\u2019s power, no creature in the sanctuaries could do battle with even his littlest finger. They won\u2019t be able to do anything to hurt him. Plus, Old Cat is following Little Master. Although that Old Cat is a bit lame and doesn\u2019t do much, he is one of the four holy beasts. He used to watch over the sanctuaries. He won\u2019t let anyone or anything bring harm to the Little Master.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmph, who knows if Old Cat is reliable?\u201d Auntie Mei coldly asked.\n\n\u201cThat is not right. Why is it going so bright over there? I think I can see a light.\u201d The red beast with an eye was staring into the darkness.\n\nOld Vulture stared off into the distance too. Inside the darkness, there was a twinkle of light that was expanding. Although it was still unable to light up the holy palace and eradicate its dark, they could see the light.\n\nAuntie Mei looked toward the light and was shocked. \u201cWhat happened? That light can shine the darkness around the holy palace. What happened outside?\u201d\n\nOld Vulture had the best vision among them. While he was watching, he suddenly screamed. \u201cThe Holy Kirin\u2026 It is the Holy Kirin\u2026 That is the Holy Kirin\u2019s spirit releasing power.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? The Holy Kirin\u2019s spirit\u2026 Isn\u2019t that inside the fate monument? Little Master did not go to the fate monument yet, so how could the Holy Kirin\u2019s spirit appear?\u201d The red, angry beast let out a strange scream.\n\n\u201cImpossible\u2026 Aside from Little Master, no one else should be able to activate the Holy Kirin\u2019s spirit.\u201d Auntie Mei\u2019s expression changed.\n\n\u201cWhy are we still sitting here talking crap? Let\u2019s just get out of here. The Little Master\u2019s Holy Kirin spirit cannot be stolen by someone else.\u201d The red, murderous beast weirdly screamed and flew into the darkness.\n\nHis body touched the darkness, which made some same sounds mechanical and cogwheel-breaking sounds. The red flames of his body struck the darkness. Every step he took was like breaking the world.\n\n\u201cGoddamn barren power\u2026\u201d The red murderous beast kept swearing as he went. No matter how much he swore, he could only travel through the dark.\n\nOld Vulture flapped his wings and soared into the dark. It looked like a sky full of dark clouds. After going into the dark, there were some thunderous noises. There were lots of sparks around him as he battled with the dark.\n\nAuntie Mei and the eyeless big beast rushed into the darkness too. They traveled slowly through the dark. They were in a rush, but they could not get out of the darkness to reach the shadow of the Holy Kirin.\n\nDeep Abyss Grandmaster and Sky Palace\u2019s first seat looked at the Holy Kirin, which was a transparent light. It did not have a body.\n\nHan Sen also stared at the Holy Kirin. The more he looked at it, the more afraid he became.\n\nThe Holy Kirin was not a xenogeneic right now. The presence of its body was more like\u2026\n\n\u201cBeast soul!\u201d Han Sen almost screamed. The Holy Kirin looked like a beast soul and not a xenogeneic.\n\nAs the Holy Kirin body\u2019s light grew brighter, the fate monument\u2019s light became weaker. It was like the power in the fate monument was going into the Holy Kirin. It made its body more solid. Although it was not solid yet, it did appear to become more tangible and alive.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? Isn\u2019t the Holy Kirin dead? Its horn became a statue, and its meat was cooked. How can the beast\u2019s soul still exist? If the beast soul is a spirit, can the body be gone but the spirit remain?\u201d Han Sen had many questions flooding his mind.\n\nWala!\n\nThe fate monument lost all of its light. It shattered like a rotten hunk of wood. It turned into a sky full of dust. The Holy Kirin was looking very alive, but its body still looked like a beast soul. It did not become fully solid.\n\nThe light on the Holy Kirin started to become dim. The light, which had been so bright, turned dark. Only the two long, bright lanterns continued to glow with their limited range of light.\n\n\u201cOne of the four holy beasts, the Holy Kirin, is not dead!\u201d An Extreme King deified elite was utterly flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cNo, the Holy Kirin\u2019s situation does not seem to mean it is alive.\u201d The Deep Abyss Grandmaster stared at the Holy Kirin and frowned.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat stared at the Holy Kirin too. He pulled his hands into his sleeves and flicked. He looked like he wanted to attack, but he didn\u2019t. He seemed to be afraid.\n\nThe Holy Kirin\u2019s eyes looked at Han Sen. It four legs were moving toward Han Sen. The holy light was on his body. The scene was exceptionally strange to witness.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cWhat does it seek to do? Is it because I activated the fate monument? Does it now want to fight me? Does it want its Kirin horn back?\u201d\n\nWhile Han Sen was guessing, the Holy Kirin came before him. It did not look as if it was doing anything.\n\nThe Holy Kirin stopped very close to Han Sen. It was so close that it made Han Sen wish to retreat, but the Holy Kirin suddenly and quietly moaned to Han Sen. It lowered its head and placed its head in front of Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Holy Kirin, which was lowering its head. He had no idea what the Holy Kirin wanted.\n\nThe Holy Kirin saw that Han Sen was not doing anything, so it moaned again. It then put its head closer to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen finally understood something. He reached out his hand and touched the Holy Kirin\u2019s head."
