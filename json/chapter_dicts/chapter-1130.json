Uncle Bug told him the shadow of the creature was what possessed his son, but the actual body he would have to defeat was someplace in the valley.\n\nHan Sen thought about the bugs he had thrown down into the valley, the ones that disappeared, and wondered whether or not they were related to the creature he was preparing to defeat.\n\nHan Sen returned to the valley, bringing many bugs with him. He perched himself atop the hill like he had before and tossed a few bugs down into the valley every now and again.\n\nJust like before, the bugs would try to scurry away but then get snatched by some unseen force. They\u2019d just vanish into thin air.\n\nHan Sen kept chucking the bugs into the same spot and noticed the bugs only disappeared when they reached a certain point.\n\nThat proved there were no space cracks, as space cracks could not move.\n\n\u201cIf there are no space cracks, then that means it must be a super creature. But if so, how can it make these bugs disappear so easily?\u201d Han Sen thought hard about what may have been the crux of the issue.\n\nWhatever was going on, his dongxuan aura was not able to detect any creatures down there. Being unable to determine the nature of the threat made Han Sen far more cautious than usual.\n\nHan Sen remained on the hill for a few days, watching and waiting to see what he could. If there was a creature lurking beneath the sands, he wanted to see it.\n\nHan Sen watched the shadows of the bugs intently, wanting to see if there were any disruption before they disappeared. It was a fine idea, but did not provide him the answers he sought. Nothing was assaulting the bugs from within their own shadows.\n\nIn the midst of all these uncertainties, one thing was for sure. It was a scary super creature, and Han Sen had yet to gauge how powerful it might have been. A lack of intel was one of the most dangerous things, when attempting to fight a foe.\n\nBut whatever the case may have been, it looked to Han Sen that there were two possibilities. First, the creature itself was invisible. Or second, the powers of the super creature were invisible.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the second possibility, I should have no problems dealing with it. If it\u2019s the first possibility, I\u2019ll need to watch myself. That\u2019d be tough,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nIf it was a creature that the dongxuan aura could not even detect, it had to be an absurdly powerful monster.\n\nDue to Han Sen\u2019s desire for caution, he remained there for another fifteen days. Unfortunately, despite all the time that had elapsed, he still had zero concrete intel on the creature he would have to face.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t want the secret of Han Jinzhi and Seventh Team, he wouldn\u2019t even think about fighting such a creature.\n\nYou only live once. Every strike could be fatal, so Han Sen needed to know he could get a handle on whatever he would face when he confronted the creature.\n\nAnd Han Sen really wanted to know what had happened with the Seventh Team and why Han Jinzhi humiliated God as Sunset had told him. And also, why Qin Huaizhen had told him to be wary of Han Jinzhi.\n\nHan Sen had been collecting breadcrumbs for this entire affair for a long time, and he was desperate for the full story. The knowledge was within his reach, so he had to commit to what he had pledged to do for Uncle Bug. If he did this, he would finally know everything he wished to.\n\nThat night, Han Sen heard a baby crying once more. Uncle Bug said he had to bring his son there once a month, so it wasn\u2019t time yet. This made Han Sen a little wary, and he wondered why there\u2019d be movement now.\n\nThe human-faced scorpions came out, covering every inch of that valley in their thick and wriggling hides. It was disgusting.\n\nIf there were space cracks there, scorpions would have slipped in no doubt. This frightening sight certainly put that theory to bed.\n\nTheir movement drew Han Sen\u2019s attention, and he watched intently as they all began to congregate in the center of the Y-shaped valley. A curious view, as there did not appear to be anything of particular interest in that spot.\n\nEventually, their congregation began to spread and form a circle. They left the very center spot open.\n\nHan Sen stared at the space they had left open and noticed something.\n\nThe moonlight was extra bright on this night, due to it being a full moon.\n\nThe moonlight began to illuminate the oily hides of the scorpions, making the faces on their backs seem alive.\n\nWhen the light hit the spot they had left open, it was as if the light was striking an invisible wall. It seemed to collect and form a faint outline.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide, as more and more light gathered to form a faint figure.\n\nEventually, Han Sen was able to see the shape of a half-man, half-scorpion creature that was identical to the one that plagued Uncle Bug\u2019s son.\n\nBut whereas the shadow variant he had seen with Uncle Bug\u2019s son was pitch black, this one was transparent.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the moonlight illuminating it, Han Sen didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have been able to see it at all.\n\nBut even though Han Sen could see it with his naked eyes, the dongxuan aura still proved ineffective. He still couldn\u2019t get a feel for the lifeforce of the scorpion.\n\nThe fact that the transparent scorpion seemed to be capable of eluding the dongxuan aura was a frightening thing to think about.\n\n\u201cThis guy is invisible!\u201d Han Sen frowned. This was the worst possible result he could have.\n\n\u201cMaybe it would be best for me to strike now, while I can still see it.\u201d Han Sen stared at it, thinking of how he\u2019d begin his engagement with the beast.\n\nBut eventually, Han Sen decided against fighting it. He remained there, watching the invisible scorpion, absorbing the moonlight that had been channeled through the bright reflections of the little scorpions\u2019 chitin.\n\nThis went on for one hour, and when the moon began its descent, the reflections subsided. And then, the faint outline of the scorpion man-beast went with it."
