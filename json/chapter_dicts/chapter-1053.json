We need to take their views into consideration and deal with the entire matter responsibly. Things were settled, but it was you who wanted to change what we had already established. It is only fair for them to make a request, in exchange,\u201d Ji Ruozhen explained.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen knew there was a limit to the number of people who could go, and there was a certain requirement of strength needed to be shown for going.\n\nOnly surpassers were able to go. Only they possessed the minimum requirement of strength, and the maximum, also. Demi-gods were considered too powerful, and were forbidden from entry.\n\nFor the shura, only fighters of the third rank could go. Any higher than the third rank would also be deemed too powerful. At the third rank, they would have a fitness of around the two thousand mark on the human scale.\n\nThis was actually a little higher than the humans who were going though, where the average sat at around one thousand eight hundred.\n\nBut with that being said, humans had advantages elsewhere, which helped level the playing field. Unlike the shura, humans could open gene locks and wield elements and hyper geno arts. The shura had to rely on raw physical strength.\n\nHan Sen took a spaceship to Tans for the fight that would determine whether or not he could accompany the expedition. He knew full well who his opponent was going to be, as Ji Ruozhen made sure to give Han Sen all the details. While he wasn\u2019t fond of the way Han Sen was forcing his way in, he didn\u2019t want him to get hurt or go in without a clue of what he was going up against.\n\nHis opponent\u2019s name was Yu Tuoshan. He was the seventh son of the current shura queen. On the human metric, his fitness had been calculated to be two-thousand-one-hundred-and-forty-three.\n\nThe other seven shura were bound to be of similar strength, as they were all regarded as elites.\n\nAs Han Sen journeyed to his fight, the shura held a meeting for themselves.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, you can allow Lou Lan to fight in your stead,\u201d the chief of the shura team said.\n\n\u201cHe beat my brother, Yu Qielan! This is my fight; vengeance is needed!\u201d Yu Tuoshan implored.\n\n\u201cDo not worry; he is merely a human surpasser. And he has only just become one. He is probably still suckling at the surpasser teat. You can beat him with ease, My Prince,\u201d Lou Lan said.\n\n\u201cIndeed I can, all without hassle. His power is nowhere near the strength of a third rank fighter of ours.\u201d\n\nNo one believed Han Sen could beat Yu Tuoshan.\n\nThe chief wished to say something, but Yu Tuoshan interrupted him and said, \u201cIt is time for the pride of that Han Sen to crumble like a castle to the ground. I am the one who will beat him, end of story.\u201d\n\nThe chief tried to say nothing more, as he pretty much agreed with Yu Tuoshan. Han Sen hadn\u2019t been a surpasser for very long, so it was likely his strength wasn\u2019t comparable to them or even the other humans that sought to go with them.\n\nOnly the most elite of the surpassers were able to fight against the third rank shura. For the humans that hadn\u2019t reached their stage, their fitness would be too low to compete.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived, the preparations for a fight had already all been established. There was no need to visit the base, and instead, he was able to go straight to the arena.\n\nIf Han Sen failed, he couldn\u2019t join the operation. Therefore, there was no need for him to go, anyway.\n\nInside the training room, an audience of humans and shura had already assembled. They were excited to see the fight.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy! Being the president\u2019s son-in-law means squat. Hierarchical status means nothing when it comes to doing battle. I mean, how many gene locks could this kid have unlocked in the little amount of time he has actually been in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary?\u201d An old man frowned.\n\nNot even the humans sounded pleased with the circumstances that brought about this fight and the possibilities of what might happen during it.\n\n\u201cTeacher Zhao, you shouldn\u2019t say something like that. Age and time spent somewhere do not always correlate to strength. If that was true, you should be the strongest man here, you old geezer! You\u2019re a hundred years old, aren\u2019t you?\u201d a middle-aged man said.\n\n\u201cJi Hailan, Professor Bai is the strongest. But Han Sen has only been there for a year. How many gene locks can you realistically expect him to have been able to open? If he makes it onto the team, he\u2019ll just be someone else you\u2019ll have to babysit,\u201d Zhao Yongbo said.\n\nJi Hailan laughed in response, saying, \u201cKeep any opinions and questions of your own to yourself, where they belong. We can take care of ourselves, so just mind your own business. If Han Sen can\u2019t beat the shura down there, he\u2019ll most likely be killed. He\u2019ll be dead before we ever even have to babysit him.\u201d\n\nProfessor Bai then stopped them and said, \u201cStop it, you two. These aren\u2019t matters for you to concern yourselves with. Keep your attention on your own missions.\u201d\n\nThe shura looked more excited than the humans did, this time. They leveled up quickly, and they could achieve their third rank before the age of forty. Compared to the humans, they were quite young.\n\n\u201cLian Chan, what are you doing?\u201d Lou Lan asked, watching another shura woman use her communicator.\n\n\u201cI am streaming the fight,\u201d Lian Chan responded.\n\n\u201cPut it away. If the chief sees you, it\u2019ll be bad,\u201d Lou Lan said.\n\n\u201cThe Prince is going to win, that much is obvious. It\u2019s only fair that the rest of our people get the opportunity to see how cool he is,\u201d Lian Chan said as she continued to adjust her camera\u2019s position to capture the entire arena.\n\nLian Chan was from a big royal family of the shura, and she was of a lineage that had many shura kings in the past. Even though the Yu family was in charge now, she and her family still possessed a great deal of influence.\n\nLou Lan didn\u2019t think there was a need to stream, but he wasn\u2019t too concerned about her desire to. Allowing the shura to watch a guaranteed victory would be an excellent morale-boost that the people of the shura sorely needed."
