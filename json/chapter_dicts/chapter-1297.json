His figure was intimidatingly tall and wide.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor for me to know I am now hosting the almighty No God Emperor. I implore you to take a seat, and I hope you find the hospitality to your liking,\u201d Lotus Empress stated.\n\nNo God Emperor was not there to participate like the rest, however. He responded by saying, \u201cI am here for the fruit; each and every one.\u201d\n\nThe guests and hosts alike were shocked at hearing the demand.\n\nLotus Empress was not too surprised, and she never expected him to be the sort who would join in the merriment of the event. Seemingly prepared for this, and having no fear, she said, \u201cIn this place, there are rules. If you have come all this way, you must abide them. I will grant you two. If you want any more, you will beat the drum.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules were meant to be broken,\u201d was No God Emperor\u2019s callous reply.\n\nLotus Empress\u2019s face turned to fright, not expecting him to shoot her down like that, twice. She cast a wall of lotus flowers around the fruit to prevent No God Emperor from reaching them.\n\n\u201cIf Night Empress was still here, I might not be so brash.\u201d No God Emperor was now walking, speaking as he went.\n\nNo God Emperor stepped before the fruit.\n\nHan Sen had only just picked up one when No God Emperor arrived before him and said, \u201cPut it back.\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored him, then took the six others he had won via the drumming.\n\nEveryone was in shock as they witnessed someone disregard what No God Emperor had told them. There was no competition, and no one there could stand up to that bully. Han Sen had to be insane.\n\nMany emperors had been killed by No God Emperor, some for merely sneezing in his presence. Han Sen was only just a human, too. Such behavior was suicidal.\n\nMoving Star Emperor was amongst the gasping audience, but he thought to himself, \u201cNice! He\u2019s going to get rid of that annoying human once and for all!\u201d\n\nNo God Emperor did not say a word. He teleported directly in front of Han Sen and broadened his stance.\n\nPang!\n\nA lotus appeared in front of Han Sen, but it was quickly shattered.\n\nLotus Empress looked at No God Emperor and said, \u201cThis is not your shelter.\u201d\n\nNo God looked at Lotus Empress, and then she summoned a host of additional lotuses. No God did not even move. It seemed his eyes were enough to kill a foe, as the protective flowers were cut down wherever his eyes trailed.\n\nHan Sen was surprised. If he had to make battle with No God Emperor, he\u2019d have no choice but to open his tenth gene lock.\n\nThe drum beast waddled over towards Lotus Empress and spawned a dome of green vines to shield her from what might occur next.\n\n\u201cDo you really want to make yourself an enemy of mine?\u201d No God Emperor coldly half-asked.\n\n\u201cYou started this,\u201d Lotus Empress responded.\n\nNo God Emperor\u2019s hands turned upwards to reveal a black hole on each palm. He looked ready to suck in everything in the vicinity. The drum beast did its best to stand strong and not fall prey to the creepy, cosmic wind that sought to pull it away, but its grip was failing. And as it was, the drum upon its back was pounding with a noise.\n\nIt was so loud and continuous, it was giving the collected audience a headache.\n\nThe vines were slipping away, releasing the protective shield it had tried to use to encapsulate Lotus Empress. Realizing this, Lotus Empress knew she had to move away, and to do this, she stepped on a raised lotus flower like a platform.\n\nEveryone in the audience was falling back, not wanting to get themselves involved and potentially invoke the ire of No God Emperor upon themselves.\n\n\u201cThis No God is an arrogant chump.\u201d Han Sen held the fruit and took a few steps back himself, eager to watch what might soon occur.\n\n\u201cOf course he is. He became the top Son of God by ranking first in Divinity\u2019s Bout; that\u2019s a feat that would inflate anyone\u2019s ego. And you know how spirits can be.\u201d Empty Witch paused for a brief moment, before going on to say, \u201cEven I don\u2019t know if Lotus Empress can repel him.\u201d\n\nThe dimensions of the plaza, and the plane of reality it stood in, was beginning to distort and twist. Without his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have been able to see a single thing with even a remote modicum of clarity.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen found himself without words. He wasn\u2019t sure what he could say.\n\nIt was two versus one already, and it would be a horrible, awry thing if she were to still lose.\n\nEmpty Witch knew things were going bad, and so she shouted at everyone there, requesting their aid. \u201cYou have all come here as guests! You have received the fruits; should you not help your hostess who has been so charitable to you all?\u201d\n\nBut the spirits there acted as if they had not heard her plea, and one by one, they began to slip away and leave the shelter.\n\nNo one was willing to defy No God Emperor and make him their enemy, all for the reward of only a few fruit.\n\n\u201cI need to help her, then,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHe was still suspicious of whatever Lotus Empress wanted with him, and he knew he shouldn\u2019t be trusting her fully, but No God Emperor was a figure who he hated. He knew if one of them had to die that night, it should be him.\n\nAnd besides, if Lotus Empress did die, Han Sen might not learn the reason for his inability to open his tenth gene locks. And what\u2019s more, this fight had all started because Han Sen had defied No God Emperor\u2019s command to drop the fruit he had picked up.\n\nHan Sen decided to join in.\n\n\u201cPah! Fool,\u201d Moving Star Emperor said aloud. He had remained there, keen to see what his most despised human might do."
