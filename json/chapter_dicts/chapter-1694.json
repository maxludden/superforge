    "text": "A humanoid creature that looked like Black God approached, carrying a demonic presence. A black hand covered the sky, crashing down on the area like a mountain. Xie Qing King had to dodge it.\n\n\u201cFather!\u201d Black God looked delighted.\n\nBig Black Sky Devil was one of the best berserk super creatures in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. He was far stronger than Black God. With him there, Black God thought they could easily beat Xie Qing King.\n\nXie Qing King, seeing the big hand approaching, acknowledged how wretchedly powerful it was. Still, that did not mean he was afraid.\n\nXie Qing King was not very good at running. And right now, running would only make him die faster. He stayed where he was, making his body surge with silver light before throwing a punch at the descending hand.\n\nThe silver light erupted like a volcano against the hand. But even so, the hand was able to suppress it. It was like lava getting squashed.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe hand came down to grip Xie Qing King\u2019s head, which Xie Qing King tried to resist by pushing it back. The ground around his feet began to break, forming cracks that webbed the land for a few dozen miles in each direction.\n\nBig Black Sky Devil\u2019s hand kept pressing down as Xie Qing King held strong against it. His body began to make creaking sounds, suggesting it was going to snap any minute.\n\n\u201cXie Qing! Obey now and I may just spare your life.\u201d Big Black Sky Devil made the offering with a thundering voice that rolled across the land with echoes.\n\n\u201cI only have two words to give you: get lost!\u201d Xie Qing King ground out\n\n\u201cD*mn you!\u201d Big Black Sky Devil was furious, and his hand pressed down with even greater strength. Xie Qing King\u2019s body continued to make sounds of strain as he trembled beneath the pressure. The ground and rocks all started to fall and collapse around him.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s body expanded, as veins coursed across him like toxic snakes. His skin began to tear, allowing silver blood to run free.\n\n\u201cKilling me might be easy, but it\u2019s lonely in hell. Maybe you should come with me?\u201d No matter how much Xie Qing King\u2019s arms shook and almost buckled, his smile did not fade.\n\nAfter that, the silver light that was bleeding out of Xie Qing King began to grow in intensity. He was like a silver sun, and with that luminosity, Big Black Sky Devil\u2019s hand was unable to crush him. The hand was actually getting pushed back.\n\nBlack God was in utter shock. Big Black Sky Devil frowned. He could tell Xie Qing King was willing to extinguish his own life if it meant bringing his enemy down with him.\n\nBig Black Sky Devil was shocked that Xie Qing King was able to unleash such power.\n\nIf things kept going the way they were, Xie Qing King would die. He was happily self-destructing; the only question that remained was how far and how strong would the power unleashed be.\n\nThere was no turning back now, though. Big Black Sky Devil thrust his powers down on him again, forcing it all into his hand in a bid to crush Xie Qing King.\n\nSuddenly, though, the sky went all bright with rain.\n\nCoins fell down from the sky, covering the entire area.\n\nEveryone was shocked as the coins fell upon Xie Qing King and the big hand. Their fire and power were suppressed.\n\nSomeone walked out from the hail of coins. It was Han Sen, who was still on his way to Big Black Sky Shelter. He wanted to use the teleporter there, but he had stumbled across this fight on his way. He detected the presence of Xie Qing King, and he knew he would have to lend him a hand.\n\nBig Black Sky Devil saw the coins, and when he did, his face changed. \u201cAre you Mister Dollar?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am Dollar.\u201d Han Sen was legitimately surprised, not expecting himself to be so popular amongst creatures. His reputation even earned him the honorific \u201cMister.\u201d\n\nAfter the fighters froze in place for a minute, Big Black Sky Devil retreated. With great politeness, he said, \u201cWhy is Mister Dollar attacking? Big Black Sky Shelter hasn\u2019t offended you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to kill him, just strike fear into him. When he achieved what he wanted, he said, \u201cXie Qing King is my friend. If you could let him go free, that would be great.\u201d\n\nWhen Big Black Sky Devil heard this, he was quick to respond without a moment of hesitation. \u201cOh, if I knew he was your friend, we wouldn\u2019t have bothered him!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Han Sen did not know Dollar\u2019s name carried such weight.\n\n\u201cYou are welcome. If you need Big Black Sky Shelter for anything, please don\u2019t refrain from asking.\u201d Big Black Sky Devil was unabashedly polite.\n\n\u201cThere is something I need to ask you, actually. Do you guys have another shelter around here that is owned? I may need to stay there for a while,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou can come to Big Black Sky Shelter if you need to. I would like to hand over the shelter to you.\u201d Big Black Sky Devil actually looked sincere.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I wouldn\u2019t like to be that big of a disturbance. Just find me another shelter nearby, if you can. The closest you are able to,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nAll he wanted to do right now was go back to the Alliance. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to get started with something big like that again right now. It was good that he wouldn\u2019t have to fight for it, though.\n\n\u201cThere is one, yes. But it is only gold class. It wouldn\u2019t be an appropriate fit for you,\u201d Black God said.\n\n\u201cThat is okay; I will only be here for a few days. Take us there and ask everybody to leave,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBig Black Sky Devil did not dare slow these proceedings, and he worked fast. Without delay, he took Han Sen and Xie Qing King to the shelter. Then he emptied the place so they could have the shelter all to themselves.\n\nWhen they were all gone, Han Sen canceled his Death Armor Swordsman and returned to his normal self.\n\n\u201cOld Han! It is you! I thought you went to the Fifth Sanctuary with Ancient Devil.\u201d Xie Qing King looked confused. Now he knew why Dollar helped him. Earlier, Xie Qing King hadn\u2019t been able to figure out why the elusive Dollar, whom he had never met, had wanted to help him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to begin. Something has happened with my family though, and I need to go back. Take care of this shelter while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Han Sen was afraid of what might be happening to his family at that moment He didn\u2019t explain any more than that, and he simply used the teleporter to return to the Alliance.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be too far from home,\u201d Han Sen prayed in his heart. If he was too far, it\u2019d be difficult to get back.\n\nBefore he went through the teleporter, though, Han Sen summoned his Death Armor Swordsman appearance as he entered."
