It made his blue blood power explode.\n\nAlmost at the exact same time, Han Sen\u2019s Nine-Life Cat tattoo revealed itself again.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Han Yufei asked with a frown. \u201cDo not be reckless! Your power is not yet sufficient enough to harness the blue blood. Even if you force the blue blood power, do you really think you can defeat someone who has blue blood as a birthright?\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew Han Yufei was right. It did not matter if it was him or Human King, but the blue blood power originated from Qin Xiu. Using blue blood power before Qin Xiu was like waving a knife before Guan Yu.\n\nHan Sen had no other choice. He could not watch Littleflower be defeated. That was his son. It was his family, and his family was very important. Now, it was not a mathematical question. There was no correct answer. There were some things that just had to be done, and they had to be done no matter what.\n\nWhen Blood-Pulse Sutra was cast, the blue blood genes and Nine-Life Cat tattoo power exploded. It made the Blood-Pulse Sutra quickly spin. It was on the brink of losing control.\n\nAt this time, Han Sen\u2019s presence suddenly changed. All his blood air went in reverse. It was going in the opposite direction of Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nThis was the geno art that was Blood-Pulse Sutra in reverse. It was called the Xuan Yellow Sutra. Han Sen did not dare use Blood-Pulse Sutra because he did not know what might happen if he used it. After all, his body was controlled by the blue blood and Nine-Life Cat power. The status of his body was too precarious. If the blood was reversed and made the three powers collide, it might mess up his body.\n\nHan Sen did not care about that at this moment. Pure blue blood power could not defeat Qin Xiu. He could not save Littleflower. As long as there was hope, Han Sen had to try.\n\nWhen the blood air reversed, the blue blood power went in reverse too. When it went in reverse, that weird blue color started to look light. It was turning into a red color.\n\nThe Nine-Life Cat tattoo was becoming brighter and brighter. It was like it was being buffed by a god power. It turned into a god light that covered Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cHow could this happen. Does this mean Nine-Life Cat power is the power to reverse the Blood-Pulse Sutra?\u201d Han Sen felt the Nine-Life Cat tattoo burn on his back. His power was getting stronger. The blue blood had almost completely turned into red blood.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow stepped across the heavy snow and quickly walked next to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen saw the shadow. His eyes looked cold in response. He stared at the shadow and asked, \u201cDo you dare show yourself in front of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine-Life Cat?\u201d Han Yufei looked shocked too. She had heard Nine-Life Cat was still alive but seeing him now was still a surprise.\n\nAfter all, she had watched Nine-Life Cat die. She was not able to bring people back to life. She had only worked as a researcher to inspect Nine-Life Cat. She wanted to know what method Qin Xiu used to revive Nine-Life Cat. \u201cI am so sorry for what I did to the Han family, and I am so sorry about Littleflower. If you want to kill me, you are free to do it now.\u201d Old Cat walked toward Han Sen slowly. He looked very calm.\n\n\u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t dare?\u201d Han Sen clenched his fists. He threw a punch toward Old Cat, who was less than nine feet away. Pang! The punch was not buffed with geno arts, but the strength of Han Sen\u2019s body made the punch twist Old Cat\u2019s face. The cat flew away and hit an icy mountain. The icy mountain collapsed.\n\nOld Cat quickly scrambled out from the broken ice. He was bleeding from his mouth, yet his face was still very calm. He walked back to Han Sen and said, \u201cEveryone knows I am one of the four holy beasts of Sacred. They did not know that the four holy beasts were just test subjects. At the end of the day, I was the one that suffered the most. I died, but Qin Xiu brought me back from hell. I have been unable to escape the sad fate of being controlled by him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf things are like that, why do you insist on hurting Littleflower?\u201d Han Sen looked at the cat coldly. His fists were still clenched. He was on the brink of striking once again.\n\nOld Cat shook his head. \u201cEven if I had not selected Littleflower, some other human would have been chosen. That person would have had to have been from the Han family. I chose Littleflower, but I left the Han family a hope. That is what I wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cOther people don\u2019t know it, but I do. Littleflower\u2019s blood comes from you. Although I know his blood is not perfect, your other child, Ling\u2019er, has perfect blood. Do you know why I did not take Ling\u2019er and only took Littleflower?\u201d Old Cat got about 30 feet away from Han Sen and stopped.\n\n\u201cThat is because Ling\u2019er was born too late,\u201d Han Sen coldly said with a grunt. \u201cYou cannot swap people because Qin Xiu could not afford to wait that long,\u201d\n\nOld Cat shook his head. \u201cIf Qin Xiu saw Ling\u2019er, I am afraid he would be willing to wait 10 million years. But it has only been a few years.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Old Cat went on to say, \u201cLiittleflower\u2019s gene blood is good, but it is not perfect. Qin Xiu used his body to be reborn. That means he has flaws. If he has flaws, then we have a chance. This is our final chance.\u201d Han Sen did not believe a word that came out of Old Cat\u2019s mouth. He coldly said, \u201cIf you did not give Littleflower to him, he would not have been reborn in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because you don\u2019t know Qin Xiu,\u201d Old Cat said. \u201cIf he wants something done, he\u2019ll have a number of backup plans. Even if I did not bring him Littleflower, he would have found a way to get what he wanted. If we had to wait for him to get a perfect body, we might as well have given him a body that was close to perfect. It was something that seemed perfect, and he fell for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you think I would believe you?\u201d Han Sen coldly looked at Old Cat.\n\n\u201cI do not need you to believe me,\u201d Old Cat said with a laugh. \u201cYou just need to follow your own will to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy will is to kill you and Qin Xiu,\u201d Han Sen said as he stared at Old Cat.\n\nOld Cat smiled even more. \u201cYou can achieve the second wish, but the first wish is something I can do for you.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Old Cat\u2019s body possessed a red flame. When one looked closer, it was not fire. It was a lifeforce leaving his body.\n\nHan Sen and Han Yufei were shocked. They did not know what he wanted to do. Pulling his lifeforce away like that was self-harm. It was more painful than being skinned alive."
