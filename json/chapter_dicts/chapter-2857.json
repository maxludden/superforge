Behind his back were a pair of gold wings, but it did not look as if he was going to do anything.\n\n\u201cDemon Alpha, I have heard that the Demons are masters of causal powers,\u201d Dragon One coldly said while standing still. \u201cShow me what you can do.\u201d\n\nDemon Alpha was completely cloaked in shadows. One could not see his face. He also did not respond to Dragon One. He raised his right hand and presented a knife. He slashed toward Dragon One, who was in space.\n\nHan Sen had been looking at Demon Alpha. He saw him swing his knife, but no power was going with it. It was like he had randomly swung his hand.\n\n\u201cIt really is the Asura power.\u201d Although Han Sen had not practiced the Asura Sutra, he had studied it for a long time. He was no stranger to its abilities.\n\nDemon Alpha\u2019s palm did not have any power shockwaves. Clearly, that was the max level of the Asura Sutra. One slash cut the cause.\n\nKatcha!\n\nDragon One\u2019s neck made a weird sound. Everyone looked at his neck. There was a small mark on his gold scales. It was as thin as a hair, but it was unable to break through the dragon scales.\n\n\u201cCausal powers really are powerful. It made me unable to react. That is not bad.\u201d Dragon One stared at Demon Alpha and nodded.\n\nWhile he was talking, his scales healed themselves. The knife mark slowly faded. Before long, no mark remained.\n\nIn Sky Palace, the woman was shocked. She asked, \u201cCan Demon Alpha\u2019s power leave a mark on Dragon One\u2019s scales? Did he really become true god class?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet you there\u2019s a 90% chance he did.\u201d Sky Palace Leader looked at Demon Alpha with interest.\n\n\u201cI did not expect Demon Alpha had a trick like that up his sleeve, but it is futile even if he is a true god,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThey are both true gods, and Dragon One\u2019s Dragon God Body is impervious to most powers. Demon Alpha cannot damage Dragon One. He is going to lose this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Dragon God Body is powerful, but causal powers are very mysterious too. It is really hard to determine who is going to win and who is going to lose.\u201d Sky Palace Leader clearly did not approve of the woman\u2019s thoughts.\n\nAt the same time, the whole universe was watching the fight. They were shocked by Demon Alpha\u2019s performance. The elites knew Dragon One was already true god class. Since Demon Alpha had been able to leave a mark on the dragon scales, there was a 90% chance that he was true god class.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe that inside a small race like the demons there is a true god class elite.\u201d Bai King looked at Demon Alpha with interest.\n\n\u201cMy King, after this fight, should we go to the Demons, take him, and have him work for us?\u201d an Extreme King elder suggested.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what happens in this fight first,\u201d Bai King coldly said. \u201cThis Demon Alpha is not a simple character.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nOn the space battleground, Dragon One saw Demon Alpha had not struck again. He asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you continue?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I attack again, you will be dead. The Demons do not want to be an enemy of the Dragons. I advise you to quit now.\u201d Demon Alpha\u2019s voice was empty. There was no emotion to discern. He sounded like electricity.\n\nYet, what he said made every creature in the universe think he was crazy.\n\n\u201cThis Demon Alpha is crazy. He did not even break Dragon One\u2019s scales. Does he have what it takes to say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet he has never beaten an opponent outside of his family. That is why he is so insane and ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare he talk like that in front of the world\u2019s bravest Dragon. That Demon Alpha has a death wish.\u201d\n\nEvery race was talking about it. Compared to the Demon, they all thought Dragon One was stronger.\n\n\u201cHa! Ha! Ha! The Dragons do not have cowards that are afraid to die. I will be standing here. If you can kill me, I can assure you that the Demons will not become an enemy of my people. From now on, the Dragons will obey the Demons.\u201d Dragon One was standing in space laughing.\n\nDemon Alpha did not say anything. He raised his hand and presented it like a knife. Then, he slashed toward Dragon One again.\n\nDragon One looked dim. He stared at Demon Alpha\u2019s arm. His body uncontrollably activated substance chains. The scary, golden, air became many golden God Dragons around him. He was like an old Dragon God that was landing.\n\nEveryone\u2019s heart almost jumped out of their chests. Although no one thought Demon Alpha could actually cut through Dragon One\u2019s body, if Dragon One was treating this seriously, it made the audience feel heavy with pressure.\n\nDemon Alpha\u2019s hand was still waving slowly. It did not look as if there was any power in it. It was like he was just playing. It made it hard for people to believe that his powerless palm could kill a true god class Dragon.\n\nKatcha!\n\nSuddenly, gold Dragon blood was spilled. The sky full of gold Dragon power broke. Dragon One\u2019s head was flying. It left his body to soar through the sky, leaving gold blood in its wake.\n\nEvery race and creature that watched this fight was petrified. The whole universe went silent.\n\nOne slash cut a Dragon\u2019s head off. And, it was the true god class Dragon One. That power was hard to believe.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Am I seeing this correctly\u2026 Is Dragon One of the Dragons\u2026 Did his head just get cut off?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery scary Sky Demon Power\u2026 Very scary Demon Alpha\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom now on, I am afraid the Demons will become the highest race of all.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Just his palm cut off the Dragon\u2019s head.\u201d\n\nAfter a long time of silence, everyone in every race was shocked.\n\n\u201cIn these geno god list fights, there have been so many unexpected events,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said with a sigh. \u201cGold, Demon Alpha, Dollar, Lou Lie\u2026 The big universe has too many scary elites.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis world is a big world.\u201d The woman looked at Demon Alpha.\n\n\u201cA big world means a chaotic world. The good days have passed. After these geno god list fights, I am afraid this universe will be flipping the sky and ground.\u201d Sky Palace Leader did not get excited. He presented a wry smile and shook his head.\n\n\u201cI do not understand how Demon Alpha did that,\u201d the woman said while looking at Sky Palace Leader.\n\nSky Palace Leader was silent a moment before saying, \u201cConsidering causal powers in the past and the results today, no matter how strong Dragon One is, he could not block the cause he had before.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s face changed as she asked, \u201cAre you saying that Demon Alpha\u2019s power can slash into the past? Does that mean he has the same power as that person from Sacred?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that is not the same. That person in Sacred could twist time and space. Demon Alpha\u2019s power focuses on cause. His hand must have the cause of yesterday, so he can slash yesterday. If there is no cause from yesterday, he cannot use his power.\u201d Sky Palace Leader paused and said, \u201cEven though the cause power is so strong, killing Dragon One is not so easy.\u201d\n\nWhile he was speaking, on the space battleground, the gold Dragon blood that was everywhere went backward. The headless Dragon One lifted his hand in space. The head that had been chopped off flew back into his hands. Dragon One placed the head atop the exposed neck and pressed it down. The head was back in place, and the wound on the neck was instantly healed."
