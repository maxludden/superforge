If you are a demi-god, it is good. If you\u2019re not\u2026 it can kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what does that mean? What is it for?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t put-off by the words he had just heard.\n\nDragon King began to slink and speak mysteriously, saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not many people in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary know what this is. Fortunately for you, I am one of the very few who know. Me and Asura\u2026\u201d\n\nDragon King suddenly trailed off into silence.\n\n\u201cIs this related to the betrayal of Ancient Devil Emperor?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Dragon King paused for a brief moment, and then went on to say, \u201cThis thing has nothing to do with us, but I knew of an artifact that was quite similar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d It was painful for Han Sen, being so patient with Dragon King\u2019s slow droning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. I\u2019ve told you many secrets in the past, but I\u2019ve never received a single scrap that could benefit me as a reward. I\u2019m at the end of my tether! Why should I continue helping you and not expect anything in return?\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen eyed Dragon King with a lethal look and asked, \u201cAh, so you\u2019re no longer afraid to die. Is that what you\u2019re telling me? In that case, perhaps there is a favor I can perform for you.\u201d\n\nDragon King rebutted, \u201cYou never planned to fix my body, so death is coming for me, one way or another.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen looked at him and saw clearly the crux of his issue, he conceded to say, \u201cI have actually been looking out for one for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap! I know you already found an egg up on that mountain. Do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cI did find one, yes. But you almost got me killed at the Sky Tree! If our roles were reversed, would you still give me an egg?\u201d\n\nDragon King had an awkward look descend upon him, and he pleaded once more, \u201cIt was a mistake! An honest mistake. Every time you ask me a question, I give you answers to the best of my knowledge. I never try to trick and mislead you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cWell, an apology isn\u2019t good enough. It sure doesn\u2019t suffice, for you to receive a super creature\u2019s egg off me.\u201d\n\nDragon King pointed at the jue and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is if you give me the egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll consider the proposition, but if we\u2019re talking a trade, the bargain needs to be evaluated. It all depends on whether the secret of this jue is decent. If it\u2019s some snob\u2019s wine pourer, forget it!\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious when I tell you that this thing is known only by very few people. I know what this is, and if I don\u2019t pass this knowledge on to you, you\u2019ll only end up harming yourself,\u201d Dragon King said, with a surprisingly alarmed tone.\n\n\u201cFine. Tell me the secret first. If I deem the knowledge worthy for the trade, I\u2019ll give you the egg. Deal?\u201d Han Sen made his offer.\n\n\u201cNo! You say something like this every time, I swear! You have to promise me this time. Pinky promise!\u201d Dragon King spoke with distress.\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cOh, come on. You make it sound like you\u2019re the only one who knows what this thing does. I am giving you an opportunity here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you suggesting you know what it does? If so, why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cIt\u2019s an item from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\nDragon King looked shocked, but he balked, \u201cYou are smart! But if that\u2019s the extent of your knowledge regarding this thing, what a waste of time to tell me. Knowing that means knowing nothing. You need to know what this thing is truly for. And me? I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for a sacrificial ritual,\u201d Han Sen then said.\n\nDragon King, with a look that had been tarred with great disdain, said, \u201cThat is not what you call a secret, either!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell me what it is for!\u201d Han Sen said, with a raised voice.\n\n\u201cGive me the egg and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Dragon King insisted.\n\nHan Sen looked at the jue and once again noted nothing special regarding it.\n\nIf it was an item from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, it really was not something he wanted to get rid of. But if carrying it around with him brought harm, he didn\u2019t fancy that, either.\n\nHan Sen wanted to know what it was before he started carrying it around with him.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t keep an eye on it 24/7.\n\n\u201cI can promise you, I\u2019ll give you the egg. But only if the information is worth it. I\u2019d sooner destroy the egg than give it to you, if you don\u2019t cough up something of value; remember that.\u201d Han Sen issued a threat.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t regret this! And I really need a body now. In the past, even if you offered me ten eggs, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.\u201d Dragon King sounded confident.\n\n\u201cBut the egg is not on me right now, just keep that in mind. When I return, you can have it. So, tell me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cIt is from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, yes. Have you heard of demi-god genes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs a jue a demi-god gene?\u201d Han Sen asked, while observing the jue.\n\nDemi-god genes were like super genes, but their proper name was Demi-God Geno Core.\n\nThese were genes that could only be obtained by demi-gods. They were different than other types, like mutant or sacred-blood genes. If a super gene was a computational command, then a Demi-God Geno Core was a hub that could execute a number of different commands.\n\nThe progress of a Geno Core affected the very powers of a demi-god.\n\nHan Sen did not know much about this, because Demi-God Geno Cores were a secret to demi-gods alone. Han Sen had only heard scraps of information about this from the Ji family.\n\n\u201cYes. It is a Geno Core that was created by a demi-god creature. I have only seen such a thing once before; where did you find this thing?\u201d Dragon King asked."
