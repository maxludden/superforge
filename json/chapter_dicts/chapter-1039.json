He was hoping Xie Qing King would be freed to eliminate Holy-Sword Emperor, but that wasn\u2019t looking likely now.\n\n\u201cYou remember me?\u201d Xie Qing King asked, with a smirk.\n\nWhile he was petrified, he had hidden his powers. Now, he did not have to.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor forced a smile, saying, \u201cI had only just been born during the times you fought in the spirit base. You were a person I greatly admired; I cannot say I expected to see you here.\u201d\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor was lying; he did not mean a word of what he said. One-hundred-thousand years ago, Holy-Sword Emperor was nothing.\n\nBut back then, Xie Qing King was not an emperor, just as he wasn\u2019t now. With Han Sen referring to him as one, though, he was taken aback and unsure of what to say.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor had not known of his imprisonment here. Xie Qing King hadn\u2019t actually ascended from king to emperor status, it was just Han Sen attempting to mislead Holy-Sword Emperor.\n\nXie Qing King was made glad, upon hearing that Holy-Sword Emperor knew his name. He did not pay much heed to Han Sen, since he wasn\u2019t on the same level as him. This was different than the way he felt about Holy-Sword Emperor, who was.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s silver eyes rested upon Holy-Sword Emperor, and he asked, \u201cHave you found anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where Phoenix Emperor once lived. There is treasure here, but evidently, it is well-hidden,\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor quickly explained.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Xie Qing King did not believe him.\n\nHan Sen then chimed in to say, \u201cI am not sure if he has recovered anything from this place, but I have heard he was able to obtain a certain geno item. That is how he was able to enter this place. Everyone knows because he held a big and fanciful celebration for it.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen said this, Holy-Sword Emperor found himself wanting to swiftly explain.\n\nBut Xie Qing King cut-in before him, saying, \u201cGive me that item or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Emperor, I\u2026\u201d This was all Holy-Sword Emperor was able to mutter before Xie Qing King swung forward with silver light.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor was not going to hand over the item he much cherished, so he decided to flee.\n\n\u201cIf only running was so easy.\u201d Xie Qing King ran after him, and both spirits disappeared.\n\n\u201cAre we the same kind?\u201d Brother Seven mumbled to ask, once the spirits were gone from sight.\n\n\u201cDo you know the Water Pavilion?\u201d Han Sen asked, out of nowhere.\n\nQin Junhao told Han Sen that, if he saw Brother Seven, he should ask this. It would confirm that he was an ally.\n\nWhen Brother Seven heard what was said, he happily exclaimed, \u201cJunhao made it to Sword-Furnace Shelter?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s taking a well-earned vacation in the Alliance.\u201d Han Sen smiled, and then went on to ask, \u201cSo, you are Brother Seven?\u201d\n\nBrother Seven nodded and said, \u201cI did not expect someone to be here, and neither did I expect that someone so young could ever possess such frightful power. If Holy-Sword Emperor survives this ordeal and decides to attack your shelter with all his might, at least you can return to the Alliance safely.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cSmoke and mirrors; I\u2019m not actually that strong. The info you provided us saved our lives. I have come here to bring you back. Holy-Sword Emperor doesn\u2019t currently know what you\u2019re up to, so he can\u2019t kill you with the contract you have signed. It\u2019s best that we take this opportunity and return to the Alliance while we still can.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven shook his head, though, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk. There is treasure here, and if we are able to retrieve it, humanity as a whole will improve. It is of vital importance, and it is imperative that we claim it before they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are under contract. Holy-Sword Emperor can easily take it from you,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBut Brother Seven said, \u201cI know. But now that I have met you, things have changed. Are you willing to go with me to get the treasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cTreasure? Where do I sign?\u201d Han Sen paused for a brief moment, but then backtracked to say, \u201cBut I\u2019m serious, you should return to the Alliance. Tell me where the treasure is, and then go. You can return once I have slain Holy-Sword Emperor.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven admitted with a wry smile, \u201cWell, I actually don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cHoly-Sword Emperor\u2019s treasure is a map. It leads to an item, located in the Phoenix Eye. But the location of the Phoenix Eye is ever-changing, so I have no idea where it might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been known to risk much for obtaining treasure. But I\u2019m telling you, your life is far more important than what any item can do for you.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven said, \u201cI am not concerned with myself right now. Come, we should find it. Once we claim it, you can ensure it stays out of their hands.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven then brought out a compass. He looked at it with a concentrated expression, as if he was trying to deduce something complex.\n\nAfter a minute of silence, he said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nBrother Seven led them in the direction Han Sen had come from. He passed three of the broken walls Xie Qing King had smashed through.\n\nHan Sen followed him with Bao\u2019er still firmly in his arms. It seemed no matter what he pleaded, Brother Seven was determined to stay.\n\nAt every turn, Brother Seven consulted his compass. It meant their passage was rather slow. Four hours later, they reached a dead-end; a ten-meter-tall door barred their way. It was a double door, and each side was emblazoned with the painting of a phoenix."
