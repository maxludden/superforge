    "text": "Han Sen knew Fang Jingqi had misunderstood him. He smiled back at Fang Jingqi, \"Let\u2019s not to go to the combat pit. Would you play a small game with me here at home?\"\n\nXue Xi shot Han Sen a look of disapproval, but this time Han Sen did not respond to her.\n\nHan Sen knew a guy like Fang Jingqi would not give up unless he was defeated.\n\n\"What game?\" frowned Fang Jingqi.\n\n\"Have you ever played red hands?\" Han Sen asked with a faint smile.\n\nFang Jingqi turned down the corners of his mouth, \"Of course, but that\u2019s such an easy game.\"\n\n\"Red hands\" was a game played between two players. One player (the \"slappee\") placed their hands palm down, hovering above the other player's (the \"slapper\") hands. The slapper hovered their hands below the slappee's, palms up. The two players' hands should be touching each other.\n\nThe slapper was on offense, and attempted to bring his hands over to slap the backsides of his opponent's hands. This must be done with sufficient speed, because the slappee's goal was to pull their hands away, and out of the area where the hands overlap, to avoid the slap. If the slapper missed the hands of the slappee during the slap, then the roles must switch.\n\n\"If our hands touch, it would be easy. How about we play with our hands not touching?\" Han Sen was still smiling.\n\n\"No problem,\" laughed Fang Jingqi.\n\nRed hands mainly tested one\u2019s reflexes and Fang Jingqi was confident that his reflexes were superior to Han Sen\u2019s.\n\nAlso, Fang Jingqi was glad that the rule of this game was that as long as the slapper was able to hit the slappee, their roles would never change. Fang Jingqi wanted to take advantage of this rule and slap Han Sen so hard on the hands that he couldn\u2019t raise his arm.\n\n\"So, as long as the slapper\u2019s hand moved, it would be counted as a slap and he could not take it back.\" Han Sen first set the rules down.\n\n\"OK, I will let you slap first.\" Fang Jingqi was very confident and reached out his arms.\n\nHan Sen did not reach his arms out but smiled at Fang Jingqi, \"Jingqi, you said there would be a mutant beast soul?\"\n\nFang Jingqi was not stupid. Although he did not care about a mutant beast soul, he didn\u2019t want Han Sen to take advantage of him either. He said, \"A mutant beast soul is for a fight in the combat pit. Since we are now playing red hands, let\u2019s consider it a prize. You could win it if you could slap me.\"\n\n\"Jingqi, this is not fun. And I don\u2019t want to take advantage of you either.\" Han Sen pondered and said, \"Forget about the beast soul. Let\u2019s change the prize to ten thousand dollars. Every time you are able to slap me, I will pay you ten thousand dollars and vice versa. What do you think?\"\n\nThe mutant beast soul pet Meowth that Han Sen got from Qin Xuan was useless and ate a lot. Han Sen had thus learned a lesson and asked for cash as he didn\u2019t know what beast soul it would be.\n\n\"Fair and square. I\u2019m beginning to like you. But ten thousand is too little. How about a hundred thousand?\" Fang Jingqi looked at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen shook his head, \"We are all friends. Losing too much might hurt our relationship.\"\n\nXue Xi quickly said, \"Right. It\u2019s just a game. No need to bet too much money. Ten thousand is already too much.\"\n\n\"Since you are afraid to lose, then we will stick with ten thousand,\" Fang Jingqi shrugged.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything, but kept smiling at Fang Jingqi. Now in his eyes, Fang Jingqi was not a person, but a walking ATM. Fang Jingqi came to him just when he was worried about money. All he needed to do was accept.\n\nIf the opponent wasn\u2019t too much stronger than him, Han Sen believed that he could win most people at playing red hands.\n\nHis understanding of his opponents and timing were among the very best. Before he got the black crystal, that was how he made his living. Fang Jingqi who thought the game was only about reflexes wouldn\u2019t be his match at all.\n\n\"I\u2019ll let you be the slapper first.\" Fang Jingqi again reached out his hands. He didn\u2019t think Han Sen stood a chance.\n\nJudging from Han Sen\u2019s age, he was in God\u2019s Sanctuary less than one year, so he couldn\u2019t have gained many geno points. In addition, the situation of his family wouldn\u2019t allow him to buy the meat of advanced creatures either.\n\nFang Jingqi himself had already been in God\u2019s Sanctuary for several years and had gained many geno points. So, his fitness and reflexes must be far better than Han Sen and Han Sen wasn\u2019t likely to be able to hit him.\n\n\"Alright.\" Han Sen reached his hands under Fang Jingqi\u2019s hands and kept a little distance from them. Han Sen kept his hands still and then asked, \"Can I start?\"\n\n\"Ye\u2026\" Han Sen\u2019s hand slapped on the back of Fang Jingqi\u2019s hands before Fang Jingqi could finish his reply.\n\n\"Ten thousand,\" Han Sen said. \"Xi, write it down.\"\n\n\"Write it down,\" Fang Jingqi gritted his teeth and said to Xue Xi.\n\nXue Xi quickly opened the holographic note board on her comlink and drew a line.\n\n\"Again.\" Fang Jingqi reached his hands out.\n\n\"Can I start?\" Han Sen asked again.\n\nFang Jingqi just nodded, staring at Han Sen's hands wholeheartedly without blinking. With the lesson learned, Fang Jingqi swore he would not be tricked by Han Sen again.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t rush this time and turned to speak to Xue Xi, \"Xi, do you want to hear a funny story?\"\n\n\"Now?\" Xue Xi was surprised.\n\nHan Sen nodded and started, \"A lovely puppy was traveling in the desert. It had brought enough water and food, but still died after two days. Can you guess why it was? \"\n\n\"Was there a sand storm?\"\n\n\"No, the weather was fine.\"\n\n\"Because it was lost?\"\n\n\"There was plenty of water and food, so it would not die even if it got lost,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"I cannot guess. Why did it die?\" Xue Xi didn\u2019t want to guess anymore because she was nervous about the result of red hands.\n\n\"Because that cute puppy could not find a utility pole in the desert, so its bladder exploded,\" laughed Han Sen.\n\nXue Xi blushed, \"Sen, that\u2019s so corny.\"\n\n\"Vulgar...\" Fang Jingqi said with his face grim, and suddenly felt a pain on the back of his hands.\n\nSnap!"
