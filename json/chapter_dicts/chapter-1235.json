He brought all his spirits and super creatures outside of the shelter to battle upon the fields. He didn\u2019t want to risk the construct of Thunder Hell Shelter getting destroyed.\n\nAfter walking a few dozen miles, he and his companions caught sight of the enemy spirits and creatures approaching.\n\nThe spirit that led the host was clad in black armor that masked his face. A subtle, dark glow shimmered around the being. He looked like an ancient deity, but Han Sen knew exactly who he was. That was Saint Fan, whom he had seen in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary. The spirit hadn\u2019t changed much.\n\nSaint Fan Emperor was sitting upon the Holy Rhino, which looked as strong as ever. It glowed with a holy light, acting as a beacon for the army to follow.\n\nWhat Han Sen had seen, when the Holy Rhino ascended to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, was still one of the most incredible sights he had ever witnessed. It was something Han Sen thought was insane. And now, over the time of its existence in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, it had been looked after well by Saint Fan Emperor, as it had opened nine gene locks already.\n\nBeside Saint Fan Emperor, there were three king spirits and a few super creatures. Behind the leading line was an army of spirits and creatures, all of varying types, sizes, and shapes.\n\nA few of the creatures looked familiar, as they were the spirits and creatures that had escaped from Thunder Hell Shelter.\n\nHan Sen frowned, noticing this. If Saint Fan had the creatures from Thunder Hell Shelter, he would know everything about the place. He was coming fully prepared, and there were very few trump cards Han Sen had left to play.\n\nWhen Saint Fan recognized Han Sen, a visible look of shock fell across his face. He said, \u201cHuman; it was you who killed Thunder Hell Emperor and claimed his shelter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Han Sen answered as he sat upon Golden Growler, eschewing all possible feelings of apprehension.\n\nSaint Fan smiled and said, \u201cI left a mark on you, did I not? I had hoped to have you come to my shelter, but that mare replaced it. Lotus claimed you, did she not? Not that it matters, because you will be mine once more.\u201d\n\nSaint Fan made it sound like he\u2019d soon expect a grovel-like bow by Han Sen, and he\u2019d have no trouble getting a submission from him. Han Sen was aware of how he was making it sound, so Han Sen said, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. In fact, it might be the opposite! Perhaps later, it will be you who belongs to me.\u201d\n\nSeeing Saint Fan there, though, made his mind drift to wonder what power the spirits possessed that allowed them to return to a previous shelter and escort creatures through.\n\nIf Han Sen could do this, he thought he\u2019d be able to bring his mother to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nSaint Fan Emperor looked miffed, and he responded to Han Sen by saying, \u201cYou might be able to steal Thunder Hell\u2019s spirit stone, but the talent that enabled that is useless against a being as magnificent as I. Get on your knees and you can return to the shelter with your comrades. All deals will be off the table once swords ring, knuckles fly, and bones break.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalking with this fool is pointless, yo. Let\u2019s kill him!\u201d Xie Qing King did not wait, and with a gleam of silver light, he took off running towards the enemy.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s power was similar to that of Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit mode. That being said, it wasn\u2019t as effective.\n\nSeeing Xie Qing King come, Saint Fan did not seem to care. It was a king spirit that had come running out to fight, after all.\n\nXie Qing King ran before a king spirit of the enemy and unleashed a barrage of punches. The enemy\u2019s fists were very quick, and they were able to repel every single hit. The enemy\u2019s fists were like shields.\n\nPang!\n\nXie Qing King punched a little harder and broke the fist-shield. Then, another salvo of punches was unleashed.\n\nThe king spirit didn\u2019t seem to care much about the punches it was being delivered, though, and it sought to launch a punch of its own at Xie Qing King\u2019s head.\n\nFortunately, his power did not match Xie Qing King\u2019s power. With a boost, Xie Qing King\u2019s fist was driven into the enemy spirit\u2019s chest, while the enemy spirit\u2019s punch was thrown into Xie Qing King\u2019s head.\n\nA hole was smashed into the king spirit\u2019s body as Xie Qing King\u2019s fist ripped clean through. And when the king spirit\u2019s own fist came into contact with Xie Qing King, it did nothing. The power seemed to have been nullified when it came into contact with the silver light that veiled Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cGet back to me once you\u2019ve practiced the art of punching walls for a hundred thousand years in a dreadfully boring incarceration\u2026 matey,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\nEveryone, witnessing Xie Qing King\u2019s coolness and ferociousness in taking the fight to the enemy, were given the hope they needed, but had struggled to find before now.\n\nSaint Fan didn\u2019t care much for his subordinate\u2019s death, though, as the Holy Rhino\u2019s horn began to shine. Immediately, the spirit Xie Qing King had thought to have killed stood up and healed back to full health.\n\n\u201cOur fight is not over,\u201d the king spirit cackled.\n\nXie Qing King frowned, and he looked to be filled with a murderous rage. He approached the king spirit again. To this, Saint Fan waved his hand, a command to the rest of his companions to begin fighting.\n\nSeeing Saint Fan not want to fight himself, Han Sen responded by commanding Purple Emperor and the rest to deal with the army.\n\nThe opponent only had seven king class elites with him, while Saint Fan and the rhino stayed out of the fighting. Purple Emperor, Xie Qing King, and Little Angel were very strong, and they were swiftly able to take control of the battleground.\n\nBut Han Sen soon found out that this was pointless. The Holy Rhino was able to heal all the forces that were beaten down, making it impossible to keep the dead, dead.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder they are not afraid to die! Injuries don\u2019t stick,\u201d Han Sen told himself, while frowning.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu-Alu!\u201d Xie Qing King\u2019s fists were like a couple of silver suns now, as they pummeled the daylight out of the spirit in front of him again. He had torn through every shield and beaten the spirit into a wretched, mangled mess on the floor, ready to be smashed."
