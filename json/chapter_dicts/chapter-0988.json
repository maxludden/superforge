This was confirmed when she told Han Sen, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. They seem to be some sort of creature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re creatures?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Thorn Baron answered, assuredly.\n\nHan Sen frowned, thinking it to be an awful waste. Who would slay so many creatures and not even consume a single morsel?\n\nSince she couldn\u2019t help, he returned Thorn Baron and summoned Moment Queen to ask her.\n\nImmediately, she looked upset. She had been in the midst of a hunt herself, and with the yank of a metaphysical chain, she had been brought over like a slave.\n\nWhen Moment Queen saw the eyeless angels pinned on the vines, though, her irritation vanished. She looked shocked and exclaimed, \u201cWho has established a sacrificial ritual here?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome again?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen looked at Han Sen with grave seriousness, and shouted, \u201cWho did this? Who did this!?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue; I just stumbled upon it.\u201d Han Sen explained the events that led him to the discovery.\n\nWhen Moment Queen heard what he had to say, she looked upon the bodies of the angels. She walked towards the vine they hung from and looked at the earth below. Then she punched a deep hole through the soil.\n\nDong!\n\nA loud metal noise emanated from beneath the dirt.\n\nMoment Queen punched the ground again and started to dig, turning up soil that was dark red.\n\nThe soil looked coarse and dry, and the further she dug, the deeper the red hue became. It eventually looked as if the earth had been wholly dyed red.\n\nIt got even stranger when jewelry started to turn up in the churned soil she was pulling out of the ground. They seemed to show up in a specific order.\n\n\u201cIt really is a site of sacrifice.\u201d Moment Queen looked ill.\n\n\u201cCan you please explain to me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nMoment Queen eventually answered, saying, \u201cThis is a festival for the deceased; something done by spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is in worship of spirits?\u201d Han Sen found it difficult to believe. If what Moment Queen was saying was true, how was Thorn Baron unable to identity what this ceremony? After all, she was a spirit, too.\n\nMoment Queen replied, \u201cSpirits have spirit stones; when they die, they don\u2019t necessarily die. The only spirits that require a sacrificial ritual are those who have failed to ascend to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. Their spirit stones penetrate their own bodies, killing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t quite understand, but he was glad she was being somewhat forthwith.\n\n\u201cThink of it as a ritual of resurrection. If their bodies are not destroyed, they can use this ritual as a manner of reviving themselves.\u201d Moment Queen paused for a second, and then went on to say, \u201cThis is a place of sacrifice. These beings were the sacrifice, and their lifeforce was wholly sucked dry. They provide their lifeforce to the spirit that requires resurrection, and the more powerful the spirit was, the more lifeforce they\u2019d need. These thirteen creatures are Wind Angel super creatures.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt a chill run down his spine, as he gulped and asked, \u201cThirteen super creatures? Was it a king spirit that did this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever did this was far stronger than a king spirit. Not even I can tell what manner of spirit would require thirteen super creatures for a resurrection. My best guess would be an emperor.\u201d Moment Queen frowned as she stopped speaking.\n\n\u201cHow do you grow the angels?\u201d Han Sen noticed a fluctuation in her tone, when she mentioned the super creatures earlier.\n\nTo this, Moment Queen hummed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking how you get thirteen of the same super creatures, yes? Well, they grow from a tree. And of course, any person who has managed to grow such a tree is undoubtedly an emperor.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked, hearing that an emperor was resurrecting another emperor that had failed its ascension to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cCan we still eat these Wind Angels?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen looked at him and said, \u201cTheir lifeforce has been sucked dry. It\u2019s nothing but compost now.\u201d\n\nHan Sen shrugged. He didn\u2019t want to eat the remains himself, but he thought it might have been a fine treat for the Disloyal Knight.\n\nSince his retrieval of the fiend, Han Sen had fed the Disloyal Knight pet pills and waterdrops for its growth. But when the pet would be able to fight, he could not tell.\n\nHe thought the thirteen Wind Angels might have been enough to enable its battle mode.\n\n\u201cDid he get resurrected, then?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. This is where the ritual is prepared. The real place of sacrifice is where the spirit\u2019s body lies. It\u2019s probably further ahead.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked in the direction Moment Queen gestured, and realized it was the way Yaksha had gone. He frowned and said, \u201cWhat is Yaksha doing there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the person you saw in the ding, yes? He was the one who went this way?\u201d Moment Queen\u2019s face warped into an expression of horror.\n\n\u201cI am pretty sure, yes.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cWe should follow.\u201d Moment Queen walked forward in a bit of a rush.\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Han Sen commanded her to stop, not wanting to risk Bao\u2019er\u2019s life by going after Yaksha."
