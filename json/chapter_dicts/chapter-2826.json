    "text": "\"Who are you? How do you know my name?\" Wan'er looked at Han Sen with shock. Han Sen's face looked very different from how it usually did. She was not able to recognize him.\n\nBefore Han Sen answered, God's Knife had already released scary blood flames. It escaped from Wan'er's hands and flew toward Han Sen through the air. The blood flames had already generated a blood demon shadow. It was holding God's Knife by its handle. It approached Han Sen slashing and thrashing.\n\nIt is a super space slash that features time and space. It can slash what exists in the past, making it a knife that no one can block. Can I block it? Can I predict its trail a second before in time? Han Sen was unsure, but he knew he had to try.\n\nThe medusa shield was instantly in Han Sen's hand. It was positioned before Han Sen as he moved his body. His other hand wielded the Cold Light Sword.\n\nHan Sen was planning on using Spell's guns, but Spell was already a part of him. She was not able to be used as a gun for Han Sen to make use of. Plus, Cold Light Sword's power was better than Spell. So, Han Sen was just going to use his Cold Light Sword.\n\nHan Sen carefully calculated his moving track, the sword light from Cold Light Sword, and the medusa shield's location of defense. The reason was to force God's Knife slashing where he needed him to be.\n\nHan Sen had not been able to make a prediction a second ago, but he could use powerful formation powers to force God's Knife to fall into the chess game-like trap he was orchestrating. That made it unable to calculate his location one second later.\n\nUsing a man's intelligence to fight a knife that could travel through time and space, Han Sen could not do it on a whim. But this was the best chance he had to fight God's Knife.\n\nKatcha!\n\nGod's Knife landed on Han Sen's back. It cut open his skin. The blood came out like crystal, and the severed muscles looked like jade.\n\nHan Sen thought, That's a very powerful God's Knife. My xenogeneic mode is only larva class, but the body strength should be almost like butterfly class. Yet, it can still cut open my body. The power of God's Knife has increased. I am afraid it might have reached true god class.\n\nThe attack was within what Han Sen had predicted, so he kept on moving. He adjusted the position and angle of his medusa shield and Cold Light Sword.\n\n\"It will kill you, too. Run!\" Wan'er did not recognize Han Sen. She was just being nice enough to warn him.\n\nHan Sen did not care. Wan'er was the crux of all Lone Bamboo's sorrows. If he was able to save Wan'er, then Lone Bamboo would no longer be in such pain. If there was a chance to do that, Han Sen was going to try.\n\nPatong!\n\nHan Sen's body was slashed again, but it was not in a critical place.\n\nIt looks like my judgment and calculations are still a little sloppy. It needs to be improved while I'm here in the actual combat. Han Sen was not shocked. Rather, he was happy. Although he had been hit, it was not in a critical place. That meant his method was working.\n\nHan Sen kept fighting God's Knife, but he incurred more and more wounds. If one looked closer, one could see his wounds were getting smaller and smaller.\n\nDong!\n\nGod's Knife kept slashing against medusa's shield. It was unable to strike his body. Han Sen was so happy that he almost groaned in pleasure.\n\nHe blocked the God's Knife attack a second before he did. The super space slash's power was like a glitchy exploit, but he still broke it.\n\nPatong!\n\nWhile Han Sen was excited, he was hit again. It hurt so badly that it made him focus. He knew now was not the time to get excited. He still couldn't block all of the super space slashes with perfect precision.\n\nCompared to his first experience, Han Sen was becoming smoother as he used formation. Slowly, he was able to block more God's Knife attacks with the medusa shield. It was harder for the enemy to use super space slash and harm his body.\n\nWan'er started reminding Han Sen about the need to run, but she slowly noticed Han Sen was actually able to weather this fight against God's Knife. She had a look of awe on her face.\n\nShe had never seen any creature able to fight against God's Knife the way he was. Seeing God's Knife, the creatures in God's Farm were scared. They were paralyzed with fear and never dared try to rebel against God's Knife.\n\nThe stranger in front of them all was actually able to challenge it, and he was able to keep going at it. He kept blocking the attacks of God's Knife. It was unbelievable to witness.\n\nHan Sen's entire body was buzzing with an incredible amount of excitement. It was like facing a problem that could not be solved and fighting for a countless amount of days in poor conditions but still seeing it through. The ability to finish and relish in the joy was like his whole heart was leveling up.\n\nHan Sen thought God's Knife was so powerful and super space slash was scary. Yet, when he blocked his first strike, his mind chilled. He was more relaxed as the fight went on, which made it easier.\n\nBefore, God's Knife created intense pressure. Now, that pressure was gone. Han Sen was able to control super space slash easier as time went by.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he could control the universe and all of its rules. It was like he could do whatever he wanted to.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen put away the medusa shield and used his Cold Light Sword to fight God's Knife. That was all he used. He was not defending anymore. He was going to try and go forward to strike.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong\n\nThe knife and sword went against each other in the air. The shockwaves created a lot of cracks in space. Han Sen was depending purely on his sword to tie with the God's Knife, which was a second ahead. It was all about attacking now. It was not like before when Han Sen had to block or evade.\n\nSo, what if you can strike a second before I can? I can block your attacks too. Han Sen was feeling completely relaxed. He was so chill. One could not describe how chill he was. The Cold Light Sword was waving casually to keep fighting God's Knife.\n\nWan'er opened her small mouth as she looked at Han Sen battling God's Knife in disbelief. She had never seen God's Knife suppressed like that. It felt like God's Knife strength was being minimized.\n\nDong!\n\nThe sword light was seen in the air as God's Knife was hit backward. The position of the knife was a bit messed up.\n\nGod's Knife really is suppressed! Now, Wan'er believed that God's Knife had been suppressed by that wild stranger.\n\nIn the next moment, Wan'er saw God's Knife turn around and fly into the sky, but Han Sen's sword light hit it down and prevented it from escaping.\n\nGod's knife... It is trying to flee... Wan'er could not believe what she was seeing. God's Knife was trying to flee. She never thought this could happen, but it was actually happening directly in front of her.\n\nHan Sen slashed and slashed. He slashed God's Knife and got it to fall back. What made Han Sen frown was the fact that he did not know what God's Knife was made of. He had slashed God's Knife many times, but the strength of the perfect Cold Light Sword did not leave any damage on it.\n\nAlthough I have already broken super space slash, I cannot destroy the body that controls the God's Knife. That is not winning. Han Sen frowned, thinking about how to destroy the God's Knife."
