    "text": "Han Sen kept fighting and consuming the spring water he could get. His mind was thinking about the little bug on his forehead, so he wasn\u2019t paying attention to anything else.\n\nHan Sen thought what he had taken was just a larger water drop. It sure tasted like ordinary spring water, but after swallowing it, he acknowledged that something might have been wrong. It was as if he swallowed a vat of lava, and his entire body flared up with pain. He was burning on the inside with a sensation that was worse than any cut.\n\nBut Han Sen kept on casting his Yin Yang Change, trying to convert the horrible substance. His other hand was reaching for his forehead, to try to remove the red bug.\n\nThe bug looked like blood. It was only the size of a needle head, and when it touched Han Sen\u2019s forehead, it tried to drill through the helmet. Quickly, a hole had been punctured through the Spell armor. The fiend was going to go right through.\n\nHan Sen used his other hand to cover the hole, but the bug was already inside the armor. He couldn\u2019t get a hold of it.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Before he could think about how to deal with the bug, Sword Know and the Tego Earl were coming for him once again.\n\nThey were just like Han Sen right now, in that they did not know about the red mist soul. They didn\u2019t know that after the red mist soul, there would not be any more spring water.\n\nThe red mist soul was extremely rare. It was an angry spirit that the spring itself had generated.\n\nThe red mist spring worked on Viscounts. It was not effective when you reached Earl, but the red mist soul was. It could trigger an evolution for an Earl. The chances weren\u2019t very high, but the mere prospect of it being a possibility was quite scary.\n\nIf normal Viscounts used a red mist soul, they could easily become an Earl. It was a guarantee.\n\nThe Kings watched Han Sen swallow the red mist soul, and they thought it to be an even grander waste. None felt this more than Night River King. He wished he had allowed Sword Know to use the Blood-Brain Bug sooner.\n\nBlood-Brain Bugs were a harmful xenogeneic. As a parasite, they could latch themselves onto the brains of others. One of them would look like a normal bug, but when activated, it could ravage the brain of its victim. Its behavior could be controlled remotely, too.\n\nSeeing the Blood-Brain Bug pierce the helmet, Han Sen\u2019s body shone. The Spell armor was glowing white.\n\nThe red mist soul in Han Sen\u2019s body, and the spring water, were converted into energy inside his armor. Spell\u2019s energy was finally released. It was going to reach Viscount class.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe Spell armor was bathed in light, and in its radiance, the Blood-Brain Bug melted. Nothing of it remained.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife glowed white as it was imbued with Spell\u2019s light. It was a knifelight.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knifemind was also increasing. It was scary before, but now it was becoming something even greater. It was way past the level of a Duke.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe person and the knife combined into one. The knifelight was like the light of dawn. It banished the dark and signaled the coming of a new day. And now, it was going after the Tego Earl.\n\nThe Tego Earl was shocked. That knifelight was scarier than any monster. It took over his entire world. The Tego Earl swung his fist like a tiger, but he himself wished to retreat.\n\nThe knifelight acted as if it had a life of its own. It smashed into his back and sent fractures all the way through his chest. He started to bleed profusely.\n\nWhen the blood spilled out, the purple mist began to spread across the wounds. The Tego Earl looked scared, and his wounds expanded quickly. His chest was torn wide open, and then, his organs fell out.\n\n\u201cAargh!\u201d The Tego Earl screamed. He had been ripped apart by the Teeth power.\n\nRebecca and the others stopped attacking. The looked at Han Sen, holding Ghost Teeth Knife like a demon.\n\nHe didn\u2019t look like he was going to stop. And he turned his murderous attention onto Sword Know.\n\nIn that fight, all that the other Earls had wanted was a bit of that spring water. It was only the Tego Earl and Sword Know that wanted to kill Han Sen. But he didn\u2019t look willing to stop.\n\nThe knife he wielded was like a demon striker. The knifelight was like a maw of toxic teeth, wanting to crush Sword Know.\n\nSword Know knew he was injured, and far worse than the Tego Earl had been just before Han Sen killed him. He couldn\u2019t take Han Sen\u2019s strike, and he looked so scared. He flailed his sword to spawn another meteoric slash that could hopefully break Han Sen\u2019s swordlight.\n\n\u201cEnough! The fight for the red mist spring has ended.\u201d Night River King\u2019s scary power and aura landed. It covered the entirety of the Red Mist Valley. He spoke in a cold voice.\n\nHan Sen acted as if he had not heard him. He didn\u2019t care about the King\u2019s presence, and he still continued swinging his knife. The knifelight cut through from the top of Sword Know\u2019s head, down through his body until he flopped in two.\n\nEveryone was in shock. They never expected Han Sen could be so cruel. Even with Night River King there, he had mercilessly slain Sword Know.\n\nNight River King was furious, and he said, \u201cI told you to stop! And you are still killing?\u201d\n\nNight River King swung his palm, and his scary power came towards Han Sen to crush him. The mere presence that the hand possessed was terrifying. As rocks were broken, it felt like the end of the world.\n\nHan Sen was holding his Ghost Teeth Knife. He stared at that hand that towered towards the sky like a mountain. He wasn\u2019t scared, though.\n\nHis knifemind roared like a beast, but the King\u2019s power did not relent.\n\nBoom!\n\nBefore the hand could land, a purple gust of knife wind came from Planet Blade. It traveled through space like a beam that crossed the universe. It broke through Planet Eclipse\u2019s atmosphere and cut through the hand.\n\n\u201cAargh!\u201d A scream sounded, and the big hand was sliced into dust by that fearsome knifelight. Night River King\u2019s body disappeared, right from where he was on Planet Eclipse.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad, Knife. Night River King was just angry, and he did not mean to hurt Han Sen,\u201d Moon Wheel King said, looking up towards Planet Blade.\n\n\u201cI will decide the fate of my student. Others should learn not to interfere.\u201d Queen\u2019s voice sounded empty, but it was all over Narrow Moon.\n\nMoon Wheel King shook his head and then vanished from Planet Eclipse.\n\nThe other Kings left, too. There was no point in them staying any longer. If they tried anything, they\u2019d be humiliated like Night River King had.\n\nNow Han Sen had his Teeth Knife knifemind, Yisha could protect him properly. They weren\u2019t Moon Wheel King, and they were not deified. They wouldn\u2019t want to incite Yisha\u2019s fury."
