    "text": "Ice Blue Knight King wanted to find out what had happened. He knew someone inside the Ice Blue Knights had assisted Night River King; otherwise, the Rebate wouldn\u2019t have been able to sneak onto Planet Ice Blue. But there was no evidence to implicate anyone, and as for Edward, nothing could be done at the moment.\n\nHan Sen and his team were put on call at the base. They wouldn\u2019t have to do any wilderness clean-up for a while.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cThat stupid Night River King! He used an Ancient Warrior Statue, and he still couldn\u2019t kill a few Marquises!\u201d said an Ice Blue Knight who looked ill.\n\n\u201cNight River King wasn\u2019t very smart, but he wasn\u2019t stupid, either. There must have been a good reason for him to lose so dramatically,\u201d Edward said flatly. \u201cIt looks like Han Sen poses a graver threat than I first assumed.\u201d\n\nThe Ice Blue Knight frowned. \u201cWhat do we do now? Ice Blue Knight King is on high alert. It will be harder for us to move. If they find the tablet, then all our work will have been for naught.\u201d\n\nEdward shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a negative Nancy. We\u2019ve learned that Han Sen didn\u2019t give the item to Ice Blue Knight King or Mister White, at least. Even if he did find the tablet, we still have a chance to claim it.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen was playing with the items he had taken from Night River King. The most valuable trinkets were the two Moon Wheel Blades. They were a good pair of weapons for a King to wield.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t need them because he already had his Ghost Teeth Knife, but he was in no rush to sell them. So, he decided to save them for Han Yan.\n\nLittle Angel, Zero, and Han Meng\u2019er had their own weapons. They didn\u2019t need an extra pair of knives.\n\nNight River King had also been carrying a King class shield. Sadly, he hadn\u2019t gotten to make use of it.\n\nThose were the only King class treasures that Night River King had with him. Perhaps he was poor, or maybe he just didn\u2019t like carrying his riches around on assassination missions.\n\nThe few Duke treasures and materials that Han Sen found were already in storage. Han Sen was going to save them for himself and use them to top up his Duke gene tally.\n\nThere was one more thing that caught Han Sen\u2019s attention, though, and it wasn\u2019t a treasure.\n\nAmong the things he had stolen from Night River King, he found a box that was around the size of a hand. It drew Han Sen\u2019s attention because the box itself had been made from a King class gene.\n\nThe material seemed to be horn or antler, and it was unusually hard. But instead of being turned into a treasure itself, it had merely been used as a storage container.\n\nStrangely, there was nothing precious inside the box. There was only a simple diary.\n\nHan Sen opened the diary, and indeed, it was exactly what it appeared to be. The diary recorded everything Night River King had going on, even the unimportant details of his days.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t believe someone like Night River King would write entries in a diary each and every day.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make much sense for the man to place a mere diary inside such a precious box.\n\nBecause of this, Han Sen assumed that the diary must be special in some way. He used his Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye Butterfly, but the outcome was disappointing.\n\nIt really was just a diary. The Purple-Eye let him see how it was created, and the production was average. It didn\u2019t even come with a bookmark. It had been made from materials that were extremely common in the geno universe. Even the brand that made it was well known. Many people used their products.\n\n\u201cIf the diary is really just a dairy, maybe its contents harbor a secret?\u201d Han Sen had difficulty believing that Night River King would write entries in his diary every day for no special reason.\n\nHan Sen skimmed through the contents, but there was nothing interesting. He started to doubt his own judgment.\n\n\u201cWas Night River King really a very sensitive man? Is that why he wrote in his diary each day?\u201d Han Sen put down the diary and looked into the box.\n\nThe box was simple. It was made from a King class xenogeneic\u2019s material, and it had no secrets or hidden compartments. It was very plain, not even decorated with any symbols.\n\n\u201cBrother-in-law, is that a diary that you\u2019re reading? Is that what you\u2019ve been doing all day?\u201d Ji Qing approached and smiled at him.\n\n\u201cMhm. I found it in Night River King\u2019s possessions. I think there must be something important inside, but I can\u2019t find anything,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cLet me see. Maybe I can spot something,\u201d Ji Qing said.\n\nHan Sen handed it over. Ji Qing examined the paper and binding briefly, then turned her attention to the content of the entries. A while later, she said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, he\u2019s been writing in code.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of code?\u201d Han Sen asked with some confusion. The diary was written in the common language of the geno universe. He knew every word.\n\nJi Qing pointed at one of the diary entries. \u201cThis is the common language of the geno universe, but when you look closer, there\u2019s a pattern to how he writes. It\u2019s a code of some sort. If you can look the words up, perhaps you will find out what he\u2019s actually saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you break the code for me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI only know the basics of cryptography. If I had a list of code words, I could probably make some progress. I can\u2019t do it without a list, though. You should probably contact the Ji family for help with this. We have a code-breaking team, and they are real professionals when it comes to this stuff. They can help you.\u201d Ji Qing passed the notebook back to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen thought she was right. After he put the diary away, he took the time to pop back to the sanctuary. He gave the diary to Ji Yanran and told her about the difficulty he was having in breaking the code.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen went to visit his warehouse. He lifted the egg, which was formerly the little red bird, from the keg. He then placed it in the Undying Bird\u2019s Nest, hoping it would hatch soon.\n\nBy the time he was done in the warehouse, the Ji family had already sent him a progress report. The patterns in the writing didn\u2019t fit any of the codes they had on record, so deciphering the diary would be difficult. Fortunately, they had been researching the geno universe\u2019s language since Han Sen returned to the sanctuaries for the first time. So, there was still a chance for them to decipher the diary. It would simply take some time.\n\nThey asked Han Sen to return in ten days, and by then, they might have made some progress.\n\nThere were many people in the base, so Han Sen knew he shouldn\u2019t remain in the sanctuaries for too long. He took the Undying Bird\u2019s Nest and the little red bird\u2019s egg back to the base on Planet Ice Blue.\n\nOrdinary xenogeneic bird eggs took three or four hours to hatch inside the bird\u2019s nest, but the little red bird had been inside the nest for an entire day. And still, it showed no response. Han Sen wondered if the egg might have died."
