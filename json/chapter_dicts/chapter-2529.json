He prepared to strike, but then he saw that it was Li Keer who had appeared.\n\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d Li Keer grabbed Han Sen\u2019s arm. Her body jolted and teleported away, taking Han Sen with her.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe Lady Li knows the geno art called Galaxy Teleportation.\u201d Han Sen looked around. He noticed that he was now far away from the planet occupied by the wolf god. Even the bronze furnace had been brought along with them. He was shocked.\n\nHan Sen had always been interested in learning Galaxy Teleportation, but he had never taken the time to learn it.\n\nHis lack of knowledge wasn\u2019t just limited to Galaxy Teleportation, either. He had only learned a small amount of any kind of teleportation. His talents in the field took too long to prepare for use, and he just hadn\u2019t taken the time to learn proper teleportation. That was why he didn\u2019t yet have Galaxy Teleportation.\n\nSo, seeing Li Keer\u2019s casual use of Galaxy Teleportation made Han Sen somewhat envious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a simple trick. If you want to learn it, I can teach you.\u201d Li Keer smiled at Han Sen as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen raised his eyebrows, then asked Li Keer. \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think Li Keer would teach him a skill like Galaxy Teleportation for free.\n\nPlus, Han Sen wasn\u2019t even sure if he had the chops to learn it. Those that could make use of Galaxy Teleportation usually had been born with the talent. The capacity to learn the skill was innate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small trick. If you want to learn it, I can teach you; I won\u2019t require anything in return. But Galaxy Teleportation does require talent and power. I don\u2019t know if you have what it takes to learn it.\u201d Li Keer smiled.\n\n\u201cYes, of course, I can learn it,\u201d Han Sen quickly said.\n\nThe chance to learn Galaxy Teleportation for free wasn\u2019t an opportunity that Han Sen was going to turn down. Whether he could learn it or not, he was going to try.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s talk as we go. If you want to learn Galaxy Teleportation, you must first learn Teleport. If you cannot use Teleport, you cannot use Galaxy Teleportation\u2026\u201d Li Keer winked.\n\nLi Keer didn\u2019t lie to Han Sen. As she taught Han Sen about Teleport, she guided them steadily toward the core bronze tripod.\n\nHan Sen had already learned a thing or two about Teleport from the times he had used Break Space Flash. He knew the fundamentals, but Li Keer was actually teaching him various types of Teleport. He needed some time to adjust to that first.\n\nBut Han Sen still managed to learn what she was teaching him quite quickly. The techniques that she taught were quite different from Break Space Flash. There was no delay; he only had to think, and he would teleport.\n\n\u201cThis is the real power of teleportation,\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\nBut Han Sen had only just started studying these new techniques, so the distance of his teleportations was limited. His accuracy was poor, as well. He could only teleport accurately within a distance of five hundred meters.\n\nWhen Li Keer saw how quickly Han Sen was picking up teleportation, it caught her completely off guard. She didn\u2019t allow that surprise to show in her face, though.\n\nLi Keer wasn\u2019t just teaching Han Sen ordinary Teleport. She had decided to teach him a skill of the Very High called God\u2019s Wander. It was part of the Very High Sense. Even if they possessed space powers, beings that had learned Teleport couldn\u2019t learn God\u2019s Wander without first practicing the Very High Sense.\n\nOrdinary Teleport skills had a delay. The only question was how long those delays were. Some delays were so short they were barely noticeable at all. The basic Teleport was similar to the highly advanced God\u2019s Wander in that regard.\n\nBut Teleport was the weakest of the skills. After it came Galaxy Teleportation. And lastly, there was God\u2019s Wander. After reaching the highest level of God\u2019s Wander, you could travel across entire systems with a minor thought.\n\nNormal Galaxy Teleportation couldn\u2019t achieve this. The further one wished to travel, the longer it would take to prepare, as well.\n\nLi Keer taught Han Sen God\u2019s Wander. She wanted to confirm the similarity of Han Sen\u2019s geno art with her Very High Sense.\n\nWhen she confirmed that Han Sen could oh-so-simply learn something like God\u2019s Wander, it revealed many things. It was a surprise how much faster he learned the skill than Li Keer had when she was in her infancy. Li Keer was very shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of person is this? He can use a geno art similar to the Very High Sense? Has someone stolen our Very High Sense? No way! Without the body of a Very High, you cannot learn the Very High Sense. Only the Sky can replicate a part of it, which was how they created the Textless Book.\u201d Li Keer was full of wonder.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t think Han Sen had practiced the Very High Sense or the Textless Book. If he had one of those, he would have known how to teleport already.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be like the Very High. And he doesn\u2019t seem to be one of the Sky. Human; what kind of race is that?\u201d Li Keer\u2019s curiosity was driving her nuts.\n\n\u201cIf I can get Dollar to become my silkworm, a silkworm that can learn Very High Sense, what will happen? Throughout the entire history of my race, there has never been a silkworm like this. It will be easy for him to become a butterfly.\u201d Li Keer was so excited, she kept thinking, \u201cI wonder what the people in my race will think when they see me with a silkworm like this.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen learned Teleport, Li Keer taught him some of Galaxy Teleportation. She left out the part about God\u2019s Wander.\n\nHan Sen believed Li Keer\u2019s teleportation skill Galaxy Teleportation was very similar to the Dongxuan Sutra. Using the Dongxuan Sutra and Galaxy Teleportation together when he teleported actually made the process much easier.\n\nBut there was a limit to how quickly Galaxy Teleportation could be learned. Before Han Sen could learn it in full, they arrived at the home of the bronze tripod.\n\nAccompanying Li Keer had benefitted Han Sen greatly, so he wasn\u2019t slow in moving to help her with the bronze tripod. He took the bronze furnace with him as he swooped forward. The half-deified bronze tripod was strong, but it couldn\u2019t withstand the attacks of Han Sen and his bronze furnace. Shortly after Han Sen began the attack, he killed the creature and cut it in half.\n\nAfter Han Sen delivered the bronze tripod core gene to Li Keer, he asked, \u201cIs one enough, or do you require more?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is enough. It is just a secondary material, however. The primary material is a core deified xenogeneic\u2019s core gene. I cannot hunt such a thing down.\u201d Li Keer sighed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t speak. He had learned two geno arts, Teleport and Galaxy Teleportation, but that wasn\u2019t enough for him to consider hunting a deified xenogeneic on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\nLi Keer went on to say, \u201cTeleport and Galaxy Teleportation you have learned, but there is one more part. But I have to seek out a deified xenogeneic first. I don\u2019t have the time to teach you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThere is another part to Galaxy Teleportation I can learn?\u201d\n\nLi Keer looked at Han Sen and laughed. Han Sen knew what she meant, and so he said, \u201cIf I help you kill that deified xenogeneic, can you teach me the final part?\u201d"
