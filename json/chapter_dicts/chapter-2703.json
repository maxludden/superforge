    "text": "To make sure he was seeing this correctly, Han Sen remained where he was for a while. The craters that the giants had made were becoming smaller and smaller. That meant his eyes weren\u2019t going funny; the mountain really was growing.\n\nBuzz!\n\nHan Sen was staring at it when he suddenly heard a high-pitch sonic sound. When that sound hit his eardrums, Han Sen\u2019s head became all blurry. He clutched his skill and tumbled down. He fell into the sea.\n\nHan Sen quickly cast a power to deflect that frightening sonic power. He felt a bit better, but his head was still ringing. He couldn\u2019t completely block the sound.\n\nFighting his way back out of the water wasn\u2019t easy. His head had only just reached the surface when he could hear that sound clearly again. He realized that the sounds were actually coming from the metal pillar. The metal pillar spun like a drill bit, and the patterns across the metal pillar shone with a weird light. The lights spun with the metal pillar, carving into the scary giant\u2019s chest. Blood poured from the wound, splashing over the giant\u2019s armor and hair. The blood left red streaks over everything that it touched.\n\nHan Sen only now realized that the giant\u2019s armor wasn\u2019t actually red. It had simply been dyed red by the blood pouring out of him.\n\nBlood had clearly been soaking into the giant\u2019s hair for a long time, as well. Only the upper-portions of the creature\u2019s hair had avoided the blood spray and maintained their silver-white color.\n\nHan Sen had thought the giant, impaled body was simply a corpse. However, as the metal pillar spun, Han Sen could sense the body trembling. It looked as if it was suffering unimaginable pain.\n\n\u201cThat guy is alive!\u201d Han Sen was in shock.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201d Han Sen was thinking to himself. But then, he heard a sound. The metal pillar was still drilling brutally into the giant\u2019s chest, but with a thunderous noise, the frightening creature turned its head to look toward Han Sen. Its eyes peered at Han Sen through the unkempt hair. Although the giant was only looking at him, it made Han Sen feel extremely unsettled. The gaze was so intense that it almost felt like it was burning him.\n\nThe scary giant\u2019s voice shook while it spoke. It seemed as if it was suffering.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t imagine what the giant must be feeling at that moment. It would be worried if having a drill pushed into your chest wasn\u2019t excruciatingly painful.\n\n\u201cWho are you? And why are you here?\u201d Han Sen flew backward out of the water. He tried to put some distance between himself and the giant, so he retreated to a careful distance before he spoke.\n\nThe scary giant continued to stare at Han Sen. He didn\u2019t look away. After a while, he said, \u201cIf you were able to come here, shouldn\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I know who you are?\u201d Han Sen asked, once he had fallen back a little further from the giant.\n\nThe scary giant looked shocked, and then he laughed, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know who I am, then that is great. That means you don\u2019t know who Sacred Leader is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are Sacred Leader?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He looked at the giant with sheer disbelief.\n\nWhen the giant heard Han Sen ask that, he looked shocked as well. He looked at Han Sen with a strange expression, and he didn\u2019t speak. It was like he was trying to figure something out.\n\nWhen the giant fell silent, Han Sen asked again. \u201cWho are you? Why have you been pinned to the mountain?\u201d\n\nThe scary giant gave Han Sen a conflicted look. He said, \u201cI am the Breaksky alpha.\u201d\n\nAlthough he was pinned to a mountain and enduring torture, the scary giant sounded extremely proud when he said those words. It was like the whole universe had reason to look up to him, all because of that one simple fact.\n\n\u201cYou are the alpha of the Breakskies? These giants are really Breakskies, then?\u201d Although Han Sen had already guessed as much, hearing the scary giant admit he was one of the Breakskies still came as a bit of a shock.\n\n\u201cYes. The others are all Breakskies, too.\u201d The Breaksky alpha froze and asked Han Sen, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Sen. I am a nobody crystallizer,\u201d Han Sen said, trying to be polite.\n\n\u201cSince when have the crystallizers developed bodies like yours?\u201d The Breakskies alpha looked at Han Sen, but his face was impassive, and his thoughts remained hidden.\n\n\u201cI think you have been locked up for too long, and as a result, you don\u2019t know what has been going on in the wider world outside. The crystallizers are different these days.\u201d Han Sen then cocked his head to the side and asked. \u201cWhy are you locked up here? Why aren\u2019t your people saving you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. This is no longer the era of the Breakskies.\u201d The Breaksky alpha sighed and said, \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t tried to save me, they wouldn\u2019t be locked up here forever and forced to dig through a mountain each and every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was able to trap you here? Was it Sacred Leader?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe Breaksky alpha had mentioned Sacred Leader earlier, so perhaps there was a connection between the two of them.\n\nBreaksky alpha shook his head. He started to say something more, but then his expression changed. He told Han Sen, \u201cQuick! Hide in my hair or you will be dead.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had already noticed that something wasn\u2019t right. Even the black crystal armor was releasing a sense indicating imminent danger. The Breaksky alpha wasn\u2019t lying.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body flashed away. He flew up to the alpha\u2019s shoulder, then climbed into the giant\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens, you cannot release a single speck of your presence,\u201d the Breaksky alpha murmured. He stopped talking and turned to stare coldly up into the sky.\n\nHan Sen buried himself in the giant\u2019s hair and reduced the sense of his presence. The black crystal armor released some weird sort of power that locked down his body. Han Sen\u2019s aura vanished until he couldn\u2019t even detect his own presence.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen felt a ripple flow through the space above them. Han Sen looked into the sky, and he saw something emerging from the area next to the sun-clock.\n\nWhen he saw the shape of the descending body, Han Sen almost screamed. It was King Jun, the being he had seen on Planet Eclipse long ago. After he was injured, Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen him again. He couldn\u2019t believe he was seeing him again here, of all places.\n\n\u201cHorizontal Evil, have you given this some thought?\u201d King Jun was wearing gold armor and a gold helmet. He looked like a god-king in the sky. His eyes were like lightning as they looked at the scary giant.\n\n\u201cIt looks like your wounds have almost healed, and yet you have time to waste here every day. If you have so much time, why don\u2019t you try to find out who attacked you and made you like this?\u201d the scary giant said.\n\nRather than being angered, King Jun replied with a voice full of cool spite. \u201cHorizontal Evil, do you really want to be trapped here for all eternity? Do you want to see your people try to save you without rest?\u201d"
