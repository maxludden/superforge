    "text": "Lightning was tearing the battlefield asunder, and it sapped the fighters of their hope of triumph. But suddenly, from the corner of their eyes, a red flame danced.\n\nHan Sen was standing there, a red flame encompassing his being. He raised his hand and a thousand firebirds shot out, hungry for murder. There were so many of them, they covered the skies like a veil.\n\nAt first, the firebirds went for the leaves. Their touch incinerated the leaves effortlessly.\n\nThe fire still raged around Han Sen, and he generated more and more firebirds.\n\nWhen each leaf was destroyed, a blood-bird spawned out of its ashes, as well. Where there was once lightning, now there was fire. The forest had become a raging inferno, all answering to the whims of the one who controlled it: Han Sen.\n\nThe fire quickly overwhelmed all it came into contact with, and everything that it touched was turned to ash. From that ash, firebirds arose. It was like the spreading of a violent, parasitic infestation.\n\nThe firebirds did not extinguish, either. They went on ceaselessly, incinerating the wolves with a ravenous appetite for the act.\n\nThe wolves whimpered and cried out for aid, but nothing could save them. The squeals were like those of tortured souls wailing from the pits of hell. Countless wolves fell in a short amount of time.\n\nAside from where they were standing, everything around them was ablaze.\n\nEveryone looked at Han Sen, who had become a fire-casting monstrosity.\n\n\u201cPhoenix? But Phoenix is not that powerful!\u201d Lin He struggled to speak. He was too overwhelmed by what he was seeing.\n\nHowl!\n\nThe five wolf kings howled to the skies once more as the lesser wolves started to scatter and run away in fear. A hundred wolves and a dozen trees had been burnt to a crisp in a matter of moments.\n\nThe wolf kings were not going to flee, though. With an aura of blue light surrounding them, they raced towards the travelers, all from different directions.\n\nHan Sen was not going to waste any time, and he was surely not going to wait for them to close the gap. He transformed himself into a phoenix and flew forward to meet one of the kings.\n\nHooooowl! Seven bolts of lightning were fired towards Han Sen.\n\nThat meant the wolf had opened seven gene locks. It was a scary thing, considering the wolf had a much higher fitness level.\n\nPang!\n\nLightning and fire collided into a dizzying array of fireworks that exploded against each other.\n\nHan Sen did not relax his attack. He fearlessly flew towards the wolf king, Taia in hand.\n\nThe wolf king bared its fangs to Han Sen in response, and lightning flickered across them. The beast reared its head, ready to sink its teeth into Han Sen\u2019s neck and rip out his throat.\n\nThe wolf king\u2019s mouth reached its target, and the monster brought its hungry maw down on Han Sen\u2019s neck. Strangely, not a single mark was left. The wolf king, however, had been cut.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe wolf king twitched as blood gushed from the wound Han Sen had inflicted. It looked ready to collapse and die.\n\nEveryone was shocked, having seen Han Sen kill a sacred-blood wolf king with seven gene locks active with a single hit.\n\nLin Weiwei thought her eyes were playing tricks on her, and she found it difficult to believe what Han Sen had accomplished in the single year he had been in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if he managed to max out his super geno points before choosing to become a surpasser. But still, he has only been here for a year. Where has all this additional power come from?\u201d Lin Weiwei retreated into her mind, as a complicated look consumed her face.\n\n\u201cSacred-Blood Creature Lightning Wolf killed. No beast soul gained. Consume its flesh to gain zero to ten sacred geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nHan Sen heard the announcement and did not relent. He went straight for another wolf king.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra was quite simple. It did not matter how many gene locks it had open, it imbued the power of blood onto every skill its user performed.\n\nThe more gene locks that had been opened, the stronger this boon of blood-power would become.\n\nWithout this skill, even with Taia, Han Sen would not have been able to take down the wolf king in a single hit.\n\nEveryone was shocked, and even the wolves were taken aback by what had just occurred. Without hesitation, they chose to flee before any more of them became victims of the ruthless man.\n\nHan Sen caught up with one of them, and try as the wolf king might, it was unable to avoid Han Sen\u2019s assault.\n\nHis phoenix flames annihilated the seven lightning bolts the wolf cast, as Taia was plunged deep into the furry fiend\u2019s throat. It was killed in one hit, once again.\n\n\u201cSacred-Blood Creature Lightning Wolf killed. Beast soul gained. Consume its flesh gain zero to ten sacred geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the wolves managed to get away. They were terrified of Han Sen, and they scrambled wildly in their attempt to flee.\n\nTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t only the wolves who were scared. Even Lin He and his people were unnerved. The power they had just witnessed was too shocking for them to comprehend.\n\nLin He could have fought against one wolf king, but it would have been a lengthy battle. The victor of such a fight would be difficult to determine, as well.\n\nBut Han Sen was able to one-hit kill a wolf king. Rarely had he ever been in such a state of speechlessness and shock.\n\n\u201cOh my God! Brother Han is that strong? Weiwei, didn\u2019t you tell us he had only just become a surpasser?\u201d Chen Hu was flabbergasted at the ruthless spectacle he had just witnessed.\n\n( )\n\n\u201cI told you that because it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d Weiwei wasn\u2019t sure what to say anymore.\n\nBut Han Sen did not have time to revel in the glory of victory, because the wolves now stopped running."
