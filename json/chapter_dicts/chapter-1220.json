An ancient stone door appeared in the early morning sky, and after it did, the man approached it without hesitation.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Han Sen repeated his first question.\n\nThe man had been kind enough to answer all his questions so far, and he had even been kind enough to give him the memory card on Xuan Men. Yet strangely, he hadn\u2019t mentioned his name.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d the man said without looking back. He continued onwards toward the door.\n\nHan Sen felt that it was all quite peculiar. The man had given Han Sen so much, except the simplest of ordinary niceties: a name.\n\nThe skeleton followed the man to the door. This was a surprise, and it made Han Sen think, \u201cHow can the skeleton follow behind him? Can other creatures traverse the same door? Is that skeleton even strong enough to withstand the fires of those steps?\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen pondered this, the man pushed the doors open. The typhoon-like gusts of wind began to blow through the opening and expand, blowing the man\u2019s hair.\n\nThe man pushed it open effortlessly, and then he ascended the steps with the skeleton in tow. Perhaps because there were two beings passing through the door, but the fires seemed stronger and more ferocious than the ones Han Sen had seen before.\n\nThe man continued to shine and glitter like amethyst, and a purple mist warped around them like a shield against the scorching whips that lashed out. The man and the skeleton walked the ten steps without trouble, and then the door shut behind them.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. It was very different than what had occurred with Xiang Yin, Yaksha\u2019s intrusion aside. That man walked as if he was going shopping, and the fires were nothing but bothersome pedestrians.\n\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Han Sen believed if that man could do it, he could do it, too.\n\nOf course, he still had a while to go before he could attempt the feat. He still needed a fair amount of additional strength, and the timeframe for when he achieved the necessary amount of power to traverse the steps was still up for debate.\n\nThe Dongxuan Sutra seemed different from Xuantian, and Han Sen did not know if their levels were the same.\n\nRegardless, he was eager to find out more about this new Xuantian he had just learned about. He had the memory card, but that could not be used in the sanctuary.\n\nBoom! Boom!\n\nAmidst Han Sen\u2019s excitement, the sound of thunder rolled. The snaps of what seemed like lightning pummeled the mountainside, vibrating the entire landmass.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Han Sen looked down at the chasm that had recently formed on the peak.\n\n\u201cA man like that wouldn\u2019t just go for a nap, here of all places, for no reason. There must be something around here worth investigating. I might find a souvenir, and it might be something that helped him. If it helped that fellow, it can surely help me.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s mind scrambled to keep itself composed, thinking of the treasure that might lurk in the darkness.\n\nBoom!\n\nAn energy pulsed out of the hole, blowing Han Sen away a few hundred meters.\n\nHan Sen kept his body straight as he flew backward, watching a purple light stem from deep inside the chasm. It was like an eerie, purple volcano that was seeking to erupt.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, to say the least. He flew around the area, but he noticed many creatures had started to ascend the mountain. When the purple light began to beam up and up into the sky, it exploded in a dizzying array of fireworks. The purple light was soon like rain, cascading over the mountain.\n\nAll the creatures on the mountain were washed with that purple rain, Han Sen included. The purple rain landed on Han Sen and moisturized his skin. The substance was warm and soothing to the touch.\n\nHe used his Dongxuan Aura to absorb the warmth, and almost immediately, he felt as if his seventh gene lock was going to burst right open.\n\nUnder the purple rain, a lot of plants came out of the soil, making the mountain bloom with lush plant life and an unrivaled vibrancy. The creatures that touched the rain were all shining now, as well. They too were opening gene locks.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen felt like a restrictive chain had been severed inside his body. It delighted Han Sen to confirm that he had indeed opened his seventh gene lock with the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nAs Han Sen sought to absorb more of that rain, though, the rain came to a stop.\n\nThe tower below became purple as a holy presence and aura started to form around it. The tower started to grow, becoming much larger. Suddenly, the tower overtook the entire mountain, becoming one incomprehensibly large spire.\n\nHan Sen looked around and stared into the crowds of creatures that had come together, but he could not find the silver fox.\n\n\u201cStrange. Did none of the Ghost Buddies actually come here, then?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nBut then, Han Sen watched the creatures resume their ascent and hurry towards the tower. Not wanting to leave with his curiosity unsatiated, Han Sen followed them.\n\nAfter he entered the tower, though, Han Sen was shocked. The minuscule tower had transformed into a shelter, and a king-class one at that. Han Sen followed the creatures and reached the top. There was a spirit statue there, with a spirit stone lodged in its forehead.\n\nHan Sen realized that man had overtaken the location where a spirit could be born. The man had absorbed its energy, and when he left through the door, the spirit was free to continue its growth.\n\n\u201cI wonder what the spirit\u2019s level is. If it was worthy for that man to take its power, it must be a strong one.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face started to turn grim as he felt the power of that stone become tangible.\n\nThe lifeforce was much stronger than he expected it to be.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be an emperor with ten of its gene locks opened, can it?\u201d Han Sen stared at the purple spirit stone in awe."
