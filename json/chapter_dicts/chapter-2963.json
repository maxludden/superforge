    "text": "Han Sen waved his knife. The knife had a holy spirit power. It suddenly cut open four people\u2019s power. One knife meant four injured. Blood was in the sky.\n\nThe demon lady and the others fell outside the holy palace. Blood burst out of their chests. They turned into a holy light that danced. They struggled a little, but they could not get up.\n\n\u201cThe karma of Littleflower should be composed by itself,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cToday, I will not kill you, but I must destroy this holy palace.\u201d He then slashed toward Qin Xiu\u2019s statue.\n\n\u201cNoooo!\u201d The demon lady shouted from the spot where she had been thrown to the floor. She was unable to stop Han Sen from attacking Sacred Leader\u2019s statue.\n\nOld Vulture, Red Ghost, and the eyeless beast were hopeless as they watched. No matter which way they viewed it, they did not expect that one day, the holy palace would be destroyed by the holy spirit Sacred Leader made.\n\nA sky full of God Spirits could not destroy the holy palace, but it was going to be destroyed by the weapon Sacred Leader had made.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knife was decisive as it slashed down. The white knife light cut the Qin Xiu statue in half through the middle. Each side fell in a different direction.\n\nThe Qin Xiu statue\u2019s race lantern, however, remained floating in the air. It did not fall with the statue.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nWhile the Qin Xiu statue fell apart, the other statues around fell apart. The holy palace was shaking and falling apart too. It was like the end of the world.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d The demon lady looked very hopeless. She could not believe the holy palace was coming undone like that. The hope that they could rebuild Sacred had been dashed across the stones.\n\nOld Vulture\u2019s eyes and the eyes of the others were dribbling blood tears. That had been their only hope for all those years. Now, that hope had been destroyed in one mere moment. It made their hearts feel like ash.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat watched this unfold from afar. He felt immeasurable relief and said, \u201cThis is the dust of history. It should be forever buried. Why disturb a world that is already in chaos?\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, why are you doing this?\u201d Nine-Thousand King looked to be in shock as he stared at Han Sen. He could not believe Sacred Leader wanted him to escort Han Sen just so he could destroy the holy palace. He suddenly felt conflicted about a whole number of things. He was frozen standing where he was and uncertain about what to do next.\n\nWhile everyone was thinking, they saw the destroyed holy palace unleash lights that came out crossing each other. There was more and more light. The rocks that fell from the holy palace all rose. Below, a crystal object that was so big like a disc appeared.\n\nFive Sacred race lanterns were heading to the five corners of the crystal disc. Each one had a place to hold the lanterns. The five lanterns started to exude a light that steadily grew brighter. They were brighter than when they were atop the stone statues.\n\nWhen this happened, the demon girl lady, who had previously appeared hopeless, was suddenly thrust into shock. They were all frozen and staring at the crystal wheel. They had no clue what was happening.\n\nHan Sen frowned and looked at the crystal disc. He felt something come out from his chest. It went into the crystal disc\u2019s center. It was Wan\u2019er\u2019s statue.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s jade statue landed on the crystal disc. It fit into the slot of the crystal disc in the center. The hand-sized jade statue grew bigger. It suddenly returned to the size Han Sen saw in the holy garden.\n\nThe crystal disc had many weird symbols and patterns because of the weird statue. It looked like a fuse box with a line of lights crossing each other on the crystal wheel. When every light crossed each other, there was a weird symbol.\n\nWhen the lights rose, the jade statue behaved as if it had a life. The eyes started to look alive. A gaze landed on Han Sen. \u201cI knew you were the person I needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am no savior,\u201d Han Sen said as he stared at Qin Xiu.\n\n\u201cI did not need a savior,\u201d Qin Xiu\u2019s voice said. It was coming from the jade statue. \u201cI am not going to save the world, and I am not looking for anyone to walk my path. All I needed was a forerunner. I needed a person that could break the rules of the here and now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader!\u201d Nine-Thousand King shouted and kowtowed.\n\nThe demon girl, Red Ghost, Old Vulture, and eyeless beast tried their best to bow before Qin Xiu. They looked happy and excited. They were in a state of disbelief.\n\n\u201cI am not what you needed? Aside from Wan\u2019er, I will not do anything for you.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cI do not need you to do anything for me. You just need to follow your heart. You and I are the same. Even without me, you would reach the path you seek. I am just the one that sees the end sooner than you can.\u201d After Qin Xiu spoke, the light on the jade statue grew brighter. The whole crystal wheel connected together. It was like it was standing on a bright moon.\n\nBefore Han Sen could say anything, Qin Xiu looked at the demon girl and the others and smiled. \u201cThanks for your hard work guys. You have done well. From now on, you guys are free to do what you want to do. You do not have to keep guarding this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, what is this all about? I thought you said that only the holy body could become the new master of Sacred. Why does he not have a holy body?\u201d The demon girl\u2019s heart was confused.\n\n\u201cYou can become the new master of Sacred if you have a holy body. You can become the next Sacred Leader that way. You can build another Sacred, but that is the lowest requirement. It is a choice you have to make to maintain the last shred of hope. What you really need is something more than that. What I need is someone who can walk further than I can. I need someone who can accomplish even more\u2026\u201d\n\nQin Xiu stood on the crystal wheel and looked into the sky as he spoke. His eyes started to look unfocused as his arms slowly began rising. It was like he was trying to hold the whole sky.\n\n\u201cAllow me to introduce you to this interesting world.\u201d Qin Xiu smiled.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but the wheel suddenly became too bright. The crystal disc spun like mad. When Qin Xiu raised his hands, the crystal disc\u2019s light was like a volcanic eruption. It became a beam of light that fired into the sky.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe entire universe started to shake. Lots of stars and systems quivered. Countless races were shocked as they looked to the sky. They looked at the pillar of light like it was the universe\u2019s anchor.\n\nAt the top of the light pillar, it looked like black ice was melting. Behind it, a world was revealed.\n\nThere were many mysterious temples and some old palaces. They all looked like a mirage as they appeared in the air. When the darkness melted in the pillar of light, everything became more clear and more real.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 It is the geno hall.\u201d Han Sen squinted his eyes. He looked at the old, mysterious buildings in space."
