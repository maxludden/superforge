He told Han Sen, \u201cIn the god area, they have more than just primitive xenogeneics. They have all kinds of deified-level xenogeneics. Even a super-strong half-deified will find themselves at the bottom of the god area food chain. Killing xenogeneics in the god area will be exceptionally difficult. Taking 10,000 steps backward, even if you could kill them, you shouldn\u2019t have to go to the god area. Outer Sky already has many xenogeneics. In fact, they probably have more than live in the god area, so the silkworms shouldn\u2019t have to go to the god area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are they spending so much effort on taking us there?\u201d Han Sen asked, even more confused.\n\nYu Shanxin laughed. \u201cSimple. They want us to fight other deified elites.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard that, he almost laughed in disbelief. \u201cNo way! Other deifieds are harder to deal with than deified xenogeneics. If I can\u2019t kill deified xenogeneics, how am I supposed to deal with deified elites?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question. Normally, we wouldn\u2019t have the power to fight the deifieds of another race. But with the Very High, things are a little different,\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile.\n\nNow Han Sen understood. The Very High had a particular purpose for pitting them against other deified warriors. It was training, in a twisted way.\n\nConsidering that the silkworms were valuable to the Very High, the deifieds of other races would go easy on them. They wouldn\u2019t kill silkworms like Han Sen.\n\nAnd the silkworms could fight against fighters from other races, allowing them to increase their knowledge and power. They could gain more experience by doing this. They would basically be using deifieds from across the universe as sparring partners. Only the Very High would dare to attempt such an audacious plan.\n\n\u201cWhat if we run into a grumpy deified? There might be some deifieds who don\u2019t respect the Very High enough to avoid killing us. What would we do then?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\nAlthough the Very High were powerful, there was no chance that every single person respected them. If Han Sen ran into someone who disliked the Very High for some reason, his little vacation to the god area could prove quite deadly.\n\nYu Shanxin tilted his head at Han Sen. \u201cHave you forgotten what silkworms are? To the Very High, we are considered tools. And if a tool breaks, it can be replaced.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Yu Shanxin said, \u201cPlus, many of the deifieds know this about the Very High. If they refused the Very High\u2019s request, it would cause problems for them. Some of them are quite eager to teach us, the chosen of the Very High, a good lesson. They might not want to kill us, but they would rather enjoy making us suffer. When you go there, you must be prepared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means we are going to the god area to get our butts kicked?\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cThat is close enough to the truth, but fights like these will help to steel our will and improve our combat abilities. Many half-deified silkworms become deified in god area fights. I guess that can be considered the silver lining.\u201d Yu Shanxin shrugged, then waved casually to Han Sen. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. You need to hurry up with the task that the leader gave you. Four years is neither a long nor short amount of time. Either way, you should get it done as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOf course, shortly after Yu Shanxin and Han Sen had this conversation, Li Keer and Exquisite showed up at Underworld Lake. There, they told Han Sen he would need to go to the god area to practice.\n\nHan Sen had prepared himself, so he readily agreed. But because of this, Han Sen didn\u2019t have another chance to go and see Horizontal Evil.\n\nThe god area was accessed in a similar way to the core area. A person had to generate substance chains, and then they could push open the god area door. Han Sen and most of the other silkworms hadn\u2019t yet generated substance chains, but the Very High had a geno fluid that would allow them to generate substance chains for a short period of time. That way, they could enter the god area sooner than would be possible if they relied on their natural ascension process.\n\nThe Very High could also use a special connection to the silkworms to follow their silkworms to the god area.\n\nBut because creating this geno fluid was difficult, each silkworm was only granted three vials of the stuff. That meant that until Han Sen became deified, he could only go to the god area three times. So, each time he went to the god area, he would have to stay there as long as he could before exiting.\n\nAfter Han Sen used his first vial of geno fluid, his power didn\u2019t increase. Changes began to occur throughout his body, though. He was able to generate a substance chain.\n\nIt was more of an image, in truth. While it had the structure of a substance chain, it lacked a deified level of power. Han Sen\u2019s personal strength didn\u2019t increase after he drank the fluid.\n\nThe process of opening the gate to the god area was the same as opening the core area door. The only difference was that Li Keer and Exquisite could also enter the god area door that Han Sen opened. They stepped into the god area alongside Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThe god area looks the same as the regular universe.\u201d Han Sen found himself standing on a grass field. He looked around. He thought the god area and the universe looked similar.\n\nThe biggest difference was the fact that the land around him seemed to stretch as far as he could see in every direction. There didn\u2019t seem to be an end.\n\n\u201cYou have just come to the god area, so you aren\u2019t familiar with this place yet,\u201d Li Keer said. \u201cWhen you see a god spirit storm, you will realize how scary the god area can actually be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a god spirit storm?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThe god area doesn\u2019t have any xenogeneics, usually. They only show up when a god spirit storm arrives. Xenogeneics only appear in such storms. So, that will show you the brutal reality of the god area. If there weren\u2019t any god spirit storms, you could treat this place like a holiday hotspot.\u201d Li Keer laughed.\n\nAs they were talking, someone came flying through the sky toward them. Han Sen had a look at who it was, and he noticed it was a deified Extreme King.\n\n\u201cAre you the Extreme King known as Bao Lian?\u201d Exquisite asked.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The deified Extreme King looked at Exquisite with confusion.\n\n\u201cWe are Exquisite and Li Keer of the Very High. Greetings.\u201d Exquisite and Li Keer greeted the man.\n\nBao Lian heard the words \u201cVery High,\u201d and he seemed to remember something. He smiled and asked, \u201cYou two are ladies of the Very High? Do you need anything?\u201d\n\nBao Lian said that, but he looked at Han Sen instead. He was obviously aware of what Li Keer and Exquisite wanted him to do. He recognized Han Sen, as well.\n\nIt was difficult for people of the Extreme King not to recognize Han Sen. He had killed a prince, defeated an elder, and kidnapped King Bai\u2019s favorite son, after all. There were many in the universe who might not recognize Han Sen at first glance, but most of the Extreme King did. Their hatred for him ran deep in their hearts.\n\n\u201cI heard that Han Sen had become a silkworm of the Very High. I can\u2019t believe he has shown up in the god area so soon. And here I am, meeting him. This is a great chance for me,\u201d Bao Lian thought to himself. His eyes flashed."
