    "text": "Chu Nan locked the door to Han Sen and the blood kirin\u2019s jail cell, and he was just about to leave when someone else walked up. It was Prince Swordstar.\n\n\u201cMy Prince.\u201d Chu Nan and his servant bowed courteously.\n\n\u201cGood work, Mister Chu,\u201d Prince Swordstar said. He walked in front of the prison\u2019s erected Bai Sema. He looked at Han Sen through the Bai Sema and grinned. \u201cBrother Sixteen, how are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place is quite comfy. I get free food, free rent, and I like the mellow vibes. I\u2019m not sure I ever want to leave,\u201d Han Sen replied, while lying on the bed.\n\nPrince Swordstar laughed menacingly. \u201cBai Yi, you really think that no one will touch you because you\u2019re a prince? Do you really think you can wash away the crime upon the blood kirin?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I do?\u201d Han Sen continued to lie casually on his back. The bed was a little hard, but for someone who was used to roughing it, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nPrince Swordstar wasn\u2019t a fan of Han Sen\u2019s attitude. He mocked him by saying, \u201cBrother Sixteen, you are so naive and cute. The Sentence Court is not someplace where you can do whatever you want. You are just a prince. During our long history, even a few crown princes have been locked up in prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. There are laws, and this is how things should be.\u201d Han Sen maintained his position on the bed, acting as if he didn\u2019t care.\n\nPrince Swordstar was there to rile Han Sen up with a display of his victory, but seeing Han Sen behave like this, he no longer felt like a winner. He actually felt annoyed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to stay in prison. Luckily, he had discovered through Fox Queen that Miss Mirror was in the middle of investigating him. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be in jail for long, because Miss Mirror would be unable to investigate him if he was actually given a ten-year sentence.\n\nPrince Swordstar didn\u2019t know that Miss Mirror was investigating Han Sen. As he looked at Han Sen, he noticed the blood kirin. He frowned and asked Chu Nan, \u201cMister Chu, my Brother Sixteen is a noble. Can\u2019t he have a cell all to himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I am happy like this,\u201d Han Sen said carefully before Chu Nan returned.\n\nAfter all, he had personally asked Chu Nan to let the blood kirin stay with him. He had to say something.\n\nChu Nan said, \u201cHe is only in lock-up for now. Keeping them both here will make things easier until the trial.\u201d\n\nPrince Swordstar lifted his lips in a snarl and quietly told Han Sen, \u201cBai Yi, are you naive enough to think that nothing will happen if you take the fall? I am telling you right now, you will really go to jail. And the blood kirin will die. You cannot do anything about it. This is the consequence of challenging me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, you are so powerful. I admire you.\u201d Han Sen was still lying on the bed, and he clapped his hands in the most uncaring way possible.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Prince Swordstar was so angry. He shouted at the worker and said, \u201cGet the blood kirin out! Separate the two and treat them well.\u201d\n\nChu Nan looked hesitant, but he still allowed the servant to proceed and open the gate.\n\nHe hesitated because Prince Swordstar didn\u2019t have any authority in the Sentence Court, but the captain was Prince Swordstar\u2019s uncle. Things could go badly for him if he didn\u2019t listen to the prince.\n\n\u201cSince when did the Sentence Court become a prince\u2019s manor?\u201d The voice of a powerful woman bellowed from the outside.\n\nWhen Prince Swordstar and Chu Nan heard it, their faces paled. They turned around and saw Miss Mirror approaching them, clad in royal garb.\n\nChu Nan was incredibly frustrated. The Sentence Court for the Extreme King was supposed to be a hellhole. When ordinary nobles heard about it, they would do their best to avoid it. Today, it was more like a bar where anyone could come and go as they pleased.\n\nBut Chu Nan wouldn\u2019t dare to provoke the woman before him. He bowed and said, \u201cGreetings, Miss Mirror.\u201d\n\nPrince Swordstar quickly bowed as well. There were many people in the Extreme King that they couldn\u2019t provoke, and Miss Mirror was in the top three. Prince Swordstar would rather upset King Bai than this one.\n\nPrince Swordstar was King Bai\u2019s son. Even if King Bai was angry, he wouldn\u2019t do anything to him. It was difficult to tell how things would turn out with Miss Mirror, though. She was famous for having grand mood swings and being very cruel. Many powerful people with great ambitions in the Extreme King had been destroyed under the thumb of Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cMister Chu, why is Prince Sixteen here?\u201d Miss Mirror looked at the jail cell that held Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAuntie Princess, in the King\u2019s Garden, Brother Sixteen allowed his guard\u2026\u201d Prince Swordstar came up to her to explain.\n\n\u201cSwordstar, what is your position in the Sentence Court?\u201d Miss Mirror turned hard eyes on Prince Swordstar.\n\nPrince Swordstar was struck with a chill, and he suddenly found himself unable to speak.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror, there is an investigation that requires Prince Sixteen\u2019s cooperation.\u201d Chu Nan had heard Miss Mirror\u2019s tone, and he knew right away that this was bad. He refrained from telling her the truth.\n\n\u201cThere is something I need from Bai Yi, too. I will be taking him back with me for now,\u201d Miss Mirror said. Someone had already walked in and brought Han Sen and the blood kirin out of their cell.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror, this\u2026\u201d Chu Nan felt as if he had two paths to choose from. He could either let it go or not let it go.\n\n\u201cAuntie Princess, killing in the King\u2019s Garden is an important crime,\u201d Prince Swordstar said in a rush. He ran in front of Miss Mirror in his plight.\n\nAs this occurred, Chu Nan\u2019s phone rang. He looked at the number and accepted the call. He turned off his phone and spoke to Miss Mirror, \u201cMiss Mirror has already discussed this with the captain. Why did you not tell me this? What are you guys doing here? Move! Do not stop Miss Mirror from attending to her business.\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t even look at Prince Swordstar. She walked right past him.\n\n\u201cLittle Brother, I don\u2019t have time to watch you play. If you want to put on a show in the future, please call me first. I will make sure I allocate the time.\u201d Han Sen walked in front of Prince Swordstar, speaking to him while he fixed his sleeves. Then, he brought the blood kirin with him as he walked away.\n\n\u201cThat a**hole!\u201d Prince Swordstar was so mad, it looked like he was going to breathe fire. His face was in a wretched contortion.\n\n\u201cWhat? You aren\u2019t going to thank me for saving you?\u201d Miss Mirror said to Han Sen as they entered the car she had brought.\n\n\u201cAuntie Princess, I think you have work reasons for freeing me. I will still have to go back later. I don\u2019t know if I should be thanking you yet,\u201d Han Sen answered, looking directly at Miss Mirror as he spoke.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s face was impassive, and her gaze was frosty as she looked at Han Sen. \u201cHan Sen, how dare you? You killed a prince, and you dare to disguise yourself as him! You really don\u2019t understand the danger you are in.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard what she said, his heart jumped. He acted cool and said, \u201cAuntie Princess, what do you mean? I do not understand.\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t move. She pointed at the ring on Han Sen\u2019s finger. \u201cHan Sen, where did you get this ring from?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Han Sen\u2019s item. I got it when I took his body,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nMiss Mirror laughed darkly. \u201cAre you aware that this ring is called Mirror Spirit Eye? It can reflect a person\u2019s soul. If you are Bai Yi, take a look at yourself in the Mirror Spirit Eye. It will see whether your soul is Han Sen\u2019s or Bai Yi\u2019s.\u201d"
