She was fuming.\n\nShe had managed to amass many time geno points, but they were incredibly difficult to come by. And now, to see half of them go to Han Sen, she felt as if her heart was physically bleeding.\n\n\u201cIt looks like she managed to get herself a load of goodies in my absence. If she managed to open five gene locks, that means she must have received at least five hundred self geno points. I doubt ordinary king spirits could achieve such a feat in such a small timeframe,\u201d Han Sen thought, as he pondered Moment Queen\u2019s situation.\n\nIt was a shame they had signed a contract, though. This meant she could not give him any more than one hundred geno points. If Moment Queen was the one who held the contract and owned Han Sen, then there\u2019d be no limit.\n\nBut, for obvious reasons, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t place himself under contract with her. And for the time being, one hundred of such geno points were more than enough.\n\nWhen Moment Queen looked at Han Sen next, there was a fire of murder in her eyes.\n\nNow that he had managed to obtain one hundred time king spirit geno points, Han Sen was able to start producing his own skill.\n\nThe Dongxuan Sutra was able to simulate Sky King and Moment Queen\u2019s powers.\n\nBut the Dongxuan Sutra had only six of its tiers open. There\u2019d be a limit to the efficiency of his creation, and if he wasn\u2019t careful in the combination of those two volatile powers, there was a chance he could hurt himself.\n\nWhen Han Sen created Saving Money, it was a long and laborious job that took him many years to complete.\n\nReturning to the Alliance, Han Sen hopped onto Skynet. He wanted to increase his knowledge and learn all he could about space and time. He even consulted Bai Yishan about the subject.\n\n\u201cI focus on the human body. Space and time, well\u2026 That isn\u2019t exactly my forte. I suggest you go see Professor Long; he\u2019s an expert on the subject.\u201d Bai Yishan then provided Han Sen with a slip of paper, before going on to say, \u201cHe holds lectures regarding hyper geno arts that deal with space and time, primarily.\u201d\n\nHan Sen filled out the application form, then Bai Yishan helped him fast-track the registration process. It was then that Han Sen realized Professor Long was the creator of Hyperspace: a tidbit of knowledge that greatly amped up his excitement.\n\nDue to this class being private for members of the Saint Hall, it was held in their base. The knowledge to be shared there would undoubtedly be secret. As such, Han Sen had to travel to Lie Men Planet.\n\nIt was a great distance away from Roca Planet, so to pass the time on the journey, Han Sen decided to practice combat in the virtual community.\n\n\u201cAre you Han Sen?\u201d Someone recognized him.\n\nHan Sen turned around to see a modern-looking couple, both of whom were in their twenties.\n\nThe girl happily ran towards Han Sen, saying, \u201cCan I just say how much I love you and Ji Yanran. Would it be boorish for me to request your signature?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a pleasure.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cHere, on this sheet of paper. Could you address it to Little Lan?\u201d The girl had quickly lifted a notebook out of her pocket.\n\nHan Sen wrote, \u201cTo cute Little Lan, Han Sen.\u201d\n\nThe girl thanked him and quickly left.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I had female fans.\u201d Han Sen was pleased after this, so he trotted around with a spring in his step. But then, he overheard a conversation.\n\n\u201cWhy did you ask for his signature? You do know he cannot fight anymore, right?\u201d the boyfriend told her.\n\n\u201cSo? I think he\u2019s a lovely person,\u201d the girl said.\n\n\u201cChildish.\u201d The guy clearly didn\u2019t approve.\n\nHan Sen, hearing this, did not mind too much. He wasn\u2019t a saint, and he knew he couldn\u2019t get everyone to like him.\n\nHan Sen entered the holographic machine to practice combat and pass the time.\n\nLie Men was on the outskirts of the Alliance\u2019s system, so it was going to take half a month of travel for him to reach it. A lot of that time was spent in virtual fighting.\n\nBut Han Sen soon lost interest in it. Each fight was a cakewalk, and after winning every single match with the greatest of ease, he grew numb and bored. He wouldn\u2019t have spent time there if he had he anything better to do.\n\nJust as Han Sen was going to go off and watch the news, he was matched with someone a little out of the ordinary.\n\nHan Sen was impressed by the fellow\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cFourth Person in the Alliance; interesting.\u201d Han Sen smiled when he saw the tag.\n\nIf it was \u201csomething-something number one,\u201d Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have been impressed. This, though, gave the impression he wasn\u2019t someone who was talking nonsense. This person exuded a feel that was real.\n\n\u201cLet me just see how strong this person is.\u201d Han Sen chuckled to himself.\n\nHan Sen was in social matchmaking, but there were rankings in play. He would only be able to match up with others of the same level, so in this case, other surpassers.\n\nWhen Han Sen entered the arena, he did not hesitate to rush towards his opponent and unleash a flurry of attacks.\n\nWhen the dust settled, Han Sen was shocked at the result. The opponent had successfully blocked each of his strikes. This person had to be special, as no one else could block Han Sen\u2019s attacks like that.\n\nHan Sen spent the next ten minutes on the offensive, but he was surprised to see his opponent successfully defend against every attack.\n\nHan Sen was surprised, and he thought to himself, \u201cThis guy really is something!\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s hands did not slow down, though. Instead, they just sped up."
