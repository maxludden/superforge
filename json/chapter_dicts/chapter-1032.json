    "text": "Han Sen reached the desert, map in hand.\n\nIt was very detailed, and there were many points of interest marked on it. Locating his exact position was not at all difficult.\n\nDue to the silver fox\u2019s continued absence, Han Sen traveled there with just Bao\u2019er.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor had not come alone, though, according to what he was told. Still, provided no super creatures were accompanying him, Han Sen thought he\u2019d do just fine.\n\nWhat Han Sen most feared was the mountain he was headed towards. It had once belonged to an emperor spirit, after all. He had no idea what to expect or what he might find once he reached it.\n\nCarrying a parasol to deflect the brutal heat of that region, Han Sen traveled. Bao\u2019er, who was in his other arm, had her tongue out like a puppy. It didn\u2019t seem as if she was too fond of the weather, either.\n\nBut suddenly, Han Sen stumbled across a dune that was littered with the remains of dead scorpions. They were muddy in color and fairly big. Each was about the same size as a small car.\n\nThere had to be at least three hundred of them all strewn about. Judging from the wounds they had incurred, each had been killed in a single hit.\n\nHan Sen checked his map again, and it was noted that there would be a vast number of scorpions in a location that looked to be where he was at right now. He was on the right track.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Holy-Sword Emperor passed through this way.\u201d Han Sen checked the wounds again, to see if he could estimate when exactly they had died. From what he could tell, they had been slain no later than one day before. He was close.\n\nThey were sacred-blood creatures, but Han Sen didn\u2019t bring any with him. They were inedible, according to Brother Seven.\n\nThis didn\u2019t just apply to the scorpions, either. Curiously, almost every monster that populated that desert had the strange property of being inedible. Their drop rate for beast souls was awful, too. As such, he couldn\u2019t expect to receive any, on his venture there.\n\nOf course, that was what he had been told and what had been written on the map. Trying to have a nibble himself was the only way he could confirm whether or not it was true.\n\nBrother Seven said, after killing a thousand monsters there, he had only been able to obtain one beast soul.\n\nWith the bodies there, at least, Han Sen knew he was headed in the right direction.\n\nAfter four days of travel, Han Sen found himself almost walking in circles. One would have assumed Brother Seven\u2019s abilities of cartography were very poor, at first glance, but it really was a strange route he had to take.\n\nBut after seeing those bodies, Han Sen was confident he would ultimately be led to God Mountain if he stayed on the funny route the map said he had to follow.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t wrong. Before long, a mountain came into view, its peak nestled above misty clouds.\n\nIt stood out, and was a striking sight. But it had just snapped into his vision in an instant, fairly close. He should have been able to see such a mountain from a long distance away.\n\nAs if it had appeared out of thin air, a massive edifice of stone was now ahead. He took a moment to take in its splendor, but wondered what was at the very top, at the peak that was hidden from sight.\n\nThe mountain was massive, though. It was difficult to comprehend its size, and it had to be many hundreds of miles in length.\n\nIt was decorated in a vast array of green plants, but the earth that composed it was like sparkling copper that gleamed in the midday sun.\n\nThe Phoenix Shelter had sealed up, and had indeed become a mountain like in the legends.\n\nNot even other emperor spirits would be careless when approaching such a place. But the task that stood before him now was locating its entrance, and for such a big place, that wouldn\u2019t be easy.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the nearby vicinity. He couldn\u2019t see any human or spirit ahead of him.\n\nThe map ended here, though. This was most likely because Brother Seven himself had never gone any further.\n\nRegardless, Han Sen hopped to it. He had to find the entrance of that place as soon as he could.\n\nNot daring to fly, Han Sen simply walked.\n\nThe mountain wasn\u2019t too steep, but the slopes were still wide. After a whole day of traveling, he was still on what could be considered the foothills.\n\nThe plants he had seen were all around. They were lovely there, and it was pleasant to know there weren\u2019t any nefarious beings lurking beneath their canopies. In fact, there were no creatures at all.\n\nHan Sen grew concerned, though, unsure of how long it would take for him to circle the mountain, if that was what it was going to take to locate the entrance.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should head straight for the peak first?\u201d Han Sen decided to venture straight up instead,\n\nIt took him a whole day of careful travel to get there.\n\nOr so he initially thought, after reaching what he believed to be the peak, he saw an even higher one up ahead.\n\nHe continued his climb up this new mountaintop, but when he arrived at the top, it was to the realization that there\u2019d be another peak to climb. The mountain seemed endless.\n\nHan Sen decided to look down the way he had come. Even the clouds seemed far-off now.\n\n\u201cThis peak isn\u2019t leading to a sky palace, is it?\u201d he wondered, despite knowing shelters did not have sky palaces.\n\nAll of a sudden, Bao\u2019er leapt out of Han Sen\u2019s arms. She kept on running in a direction, beelining there with sudden vigor.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, where are you going?\u201d Han Sen called, chasing the runaway baby.\n\nSomething had clearly snared her attention and desire, and she crawled away so fast, she eventually disappeared from Han Sen\u2019s sight.\n\nTaking a moment to scan the area, Han Sen found her again. She was climbing a tree.\n\nStrangely, it was just a pine tree. But from its boughs, Bao\u2019er jumped and disappeared again.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er?\u201d There was only one pine tree there, so how could she have just disappeared?\n\n\u201cDaddy, come quick! There is treasure.\u201d Han Sen heard her voice, but he could not see where she herself was. So, he followed where the sound came from."
