    "text": "\u201cIs it a male or a female?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Flower God in the video. It looked somewhat like a very gorgeous human, but a flower rose from its head. This flower was a violet.\n\n\u201cIt is a male. In the Flower Gods, both the men and women look very beautiful. Don\u2019t think that Violet is weak because of his beauty, however. He is actually very strong. He isn\u2019t simple-minded or easily influenced. I have contacted him before, and he is a tricky guy to negotiate with,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cIf he was easy to push around, I doubt the Flower Gods would let him deal with such important matters. After all, this decision will be a pivotal part of the Flower Gods becoming a higher race. If they fail, their entire race could be destroyed. They need to be careful with such matters.\u201d Han Sen paused and then asked, \u201cWhich race do the Flower Gods wish to replace?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. The Flower Gods are being very careful, and they don\u2019t leak information easily. Judging from what others have guessed, they would likely seek to take out the Tree Men that are next to them. The Flower Gods and the Tree Men have been in conflict for a long time, so they are already enemies. Furthermore, the Tree Men have been doing poorly in recent times. It has been a few hundred years since they had a deified in their race. They aren\u2019t exactly a powerful high race. They would be one of the easier races to knock down a peg. There are a few other targets, too\u2026\u201d Xie Qing King brought up all the information he had on the subject.\n\n\u201cDo these high races not have any allies?\u201d Han Sen asked, tapping his lip in thought.\n\n\u201cYes, but because they aren\u2019t very strong, people don\u2019t take them seriously. Plus, the Flower Gods have connections with the Ancient God. If they want to fight, it\u2019s unlikely that others would interfere.\u201d Xie Qing King pointed out more information about Violet. He then pointed at the man\u2019s image and said, \u201cNow, this guy is the key that we need. All we need to do is convince him, and then, we will be partnered with the Flower Gods and earn half of Space Garden.\u201d\n\nXie Qing King smiled at Han Sen and said, \u201cThe crystallizers aren\u2019t thought of as a strong race. I don\u2019t think the Flower Gods will worry too much about you completely overpowering them. And then, all you need to do is use your power to impress Violet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go there on your own?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t seem satisfied.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go, but I\u2019m not deified yet,\u201d Xie Qing King confessed hopelessly. He opened his palms.\n\n\u201cSo, sometimes there are things you can\u2019t do yourself?\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nXie Qing King stared back at Han Sen and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that I can\u2019t. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t do it YET.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stayed on Xie Qing King\u2019s planet for a few days. The environment wasn\u2019t too shabby. It was almost like heaven. If it was a peaceful period, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice to retire there for good.\n\nEvery day, Han Sen used the Four Sheep Cube to access God\u2019s Farm. He was hoping to see Wan\u2019er and God\u2019s Knife again. But even though a lot of time had passed, Han Sen had yet to see them again.\n\nIt was strange. Han Sen was initially worried that if he used the Four Sheep Cube, he would be thrown back to the Very High. But now he noticed that no matter where he was, he would travel to God\u2019s Farm and then return to where he last used the cube.\n\nWith things like that, it also meant he had no way of returning to the bottle world. If the Very High went to visit him, they would learn that he had escaped.\n\nIn fact, Han Sen\u2019s escape had already been discovered. A Very High elder had planned to give Han Sen another full body checkup, but when he went into the bottle world, he was unable to find Han Sen.\n\nThis surprised the Very High a lot. Han Sen had escaped from their alpha hall without anyone noticing. As far as they were concerned, this was very bad.\n\nBut the Very High now believed someone must have helped Han Sen. Otherwise, how could he have escaped? Exquisite was initially their prime suspect, since she had done it once before. But after a thorough investigation, they realized that it couldn\u2019t have been Exquisite.\n\nAfter confirming that it wasn\u2019t Exquisite, matters became more complicated. They believed there was a traitor in the Very High that their investigation had failed to uncover.\n\n\u201cHe really escaped.\u201d Exquisite was more shocked than any of the other Very High. She hadn\u2019t believed Han Sen when he insisted that he would get out on his own. But a short time after she had last seen him, Han Sen had done as he promised. This was quite unbelievable.\n\nHan Sen had been imprisoned by the Very High, the top race in the universe. Not even true god elites could escape from the alpha hall once they were trapped there. She couldn\u2019t imagine how Han Sen had managed to do what he had done.\n\nThe Very High tried to predict where Han Sen might go, and they used some special geno arts of deduction, but they were unable to catch his trail. They hadn\u2019t the faintest trace of a clue as to where he had fled. That made the Very High even more certain that there was a traitor in their midst. If there wasn\u2019t a traitor, Han Sen would have been tracked down by now, they believed.\n\nHan Sen, in the meantime, had just been introduced to Violet of the Flower Gods. The guy looked just as he had in the hologram. The man was so pretty that he could make a country fall.\n\nBut a pretty face like that didn\u2019t influence Han Sen much. He felt like Violet was too soft, and it gave him the impression that the man was actually a toxic snake. Soft on the exterior, but filled to the brim with evil and poison.\n\n\u201cThe prettier the snake is, the more toxic it is. I wonder how dangerous this Violet truly is?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself.\n\n\u201cYou said Violet hosted a banquet and invited many deified elites from all sorts of races? What does that mean?\u201d Han Sen lowered his voice to ask Xie Qing King next to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Xie Qing King fell silent, and then he said, \u201cMaybe he wants to put the cooperation up as an auction, and have deified elites compete with each other. See who comes up with the highest price and what-not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way. That would be ridiculous. This decision will decide the fate of the whole race of the Flower Gods. They can\u2019t host an auction for something this serious unless the people in charge of the Flower Gods are absolutely nuts.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I don\u2019t know. Aside from that, I can\u2019t really think of a reason that they would bring so many deified elites together. Contacting them via private means would be more beneficial.\u201d Xie Qing King really didn\u2019t understand much about politics.\n\nHan Sen looked around. He saw a few people he already knew. There was Dragon One from the Dragons, and Dia Robber from the Destroyed. Bai Wanjie from the Extreme King. Even Lone Bamboo was there. And there were many other deified elites Han Sen did not know.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Space Garden is a juicy morsel for a lot of races.\u201d There were so many competitors, Han Sen didn\u2019t think he would be the one to be contracted.\n\n\u201cThese big races are like hungry wolves circling prey. The Flower King might not want to cooperate with them. We still stand a chance.\u201d Although Xie Qing King said that, seeing people like that all around, he knew how important the Space Garden was to everyone. It had exceeded his expectations, and he knew it wouldn\u2019t be an easy prize to win."
