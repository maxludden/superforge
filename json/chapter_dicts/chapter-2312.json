    "text": "Han Sen\u2019s day hadn\u2019t gone well. He beat Bai Wuchang, but the primary root king dragon was taken by another prince.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t strong enough to beat another King class prince and seven half-deified guards. Even if he could have won, Bai Wei didn\u2019t want to offend the prince. Thet relinquished the primary root.\n\nBai Wei selected a smaller king dragon to practice with. Han Sen thought doing that was meaningless. If they didn\u2019t claim a primary root king dragon, then there wouldn\u2019t be much king air for him to absorb. Refining Ghost Bone power would be faster and more efficient.\n\nKing Bai had one hundred children, but there were only thirty primary root king dragons. Claiming one of them without fighting was very rare. You had to have a lot of luck to secure one peacefully.\n\nSo Han Sen and Bai Wei spent their days practicing on the smaller king dragons. Fortunately, Han Sen had brought many Duke xenogeneic genes with him. They were the resources Yisha had given to him when he became the Holy Child of Narrow Moon.\n\nHan Sen had brought enough Duke class xenogeneic genes to gain one hundred points, a total which he quickly reached.\n\n\u201cJadeskin Battle Body has reached the required standard for the release of its geno lock. Open the geno lock?\u201d\n\n\u201cMutant Blood Battle Body has reached the required standard for the release of its geno lock. Open the geno lock?\u201d\n\nThe two announcements played back to back in Han Sen\u2019s head. He jerked in surprise, for he had no clue what was happening.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. Jadeskin activated of its own accord, and then his entire body became jade. Some sort of switch inside of his genes had been flipped. It was like all the windows of a sealed room had now been opened, so all the air outside could come in and fill up his body. Endless power came surging into Han Sen.\n\n\u201cJadeskin Battle Body has opened its first geno lock.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had opened geno locks in the sanctuaries, but he hadn\u2019t realized that rebuilding his body and coming to the geno universe would require him to open those geno locks again.\n\nBut this was a very different process than it had been to open geno locks in the sanctuaries. Now, after a geno lock was opened, he felt like his body was connected to the planets. By standing on a planet, he could draw on the power of that planet. It reminded him of the description of astral bodies that he had heard previously.\n\nAfter the geno lock opened, the one hundred Duke genes vanished. The tally went back down to zero.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean that it takes a hundred Duke genes to open one geno lock?\u201d Han Sen regretted the fact that he hadn\u2019t brought all of his xenogeneic genes.\n\nBut when he thought about it, he realized that bringing them with him wouldn\u2019t have been a great idea anyway. He didn\u2019t have much storage capacity. If opening a geno lock required one hundred Duke genes, then opening locks for all four of his geno arts would require four hundred Duke genes. On top of that, there could be more geno locks he didn\u2019t know about. The xenogeneic genes he had saved might not be enough to open all of his geno locks, anyway.\n\nBut still, Han Sen was feeling very happy. If one hundred Duke genes could open one geno lock, then The Story of Genes should follow the same rules. Using one hundred genes to open a lock was better than consuming a whole slew of resources for The Story of Genes to achieve next to nothing.\n\nBut it was a shame that The Story of Genes had yet to reach Duke status. Han Sen couldn\u2019t yet put his theory to the test.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the case might be, I am going to have to find more Duke xenogeneic genes.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want to continue his practice in the King\u2019s Garden. After thinking things through, he decided that he needed to go off and hunt down xenogeneics.\n\n\u201cMy Queen, my practice has gone as far as it can go in this place. There is no danger in the King\u2019s Garden, so why don\u2019t you stay here to practice while I go off and hunt down some xenogeneics. I\u2019ll see if I can achieve a breakthrough.\u201d\n\nThis was the benefit of Han Sen selecting her. If he had become Bai Canglang\u2019s guard, he could only have acted on the prince\u2019s orders. He could never have said something so bold.\n\nBai Wei thought for a moment and said, \u201cIf you want to hunt xenogeneics, you can go to Knight\u2019s Paradise. That place was built for Royal Guards. There are lots of xenogeneics there, and only Royal Guards are permitted entry, so the fighting isn\u2019t too bad in there.\u201d\n\nKilling wasn\u2019t allowed in King\u2019s Garden. Since she wasn\u2019t in mortal danger, Bai Wei didn\u2019t see any reason to force Han Sen to stick around. She even walked Han Sen out of King\u2019s Garden before going back to practice on her own.\n\nShe didn\u2019t plan on fighting for a primary root king dragon, so she found a weaker king dragon to practice with. That way, no one would bother fighting her.\n\nHan Sen wanted to bring Bao\u2019er, the little red bird, and the blood kirin into Knight\u2019s Paradise, but he was told that only Royal Guards could enter. As a result, he had to go by himself.\n\nKnight\u2019s Paradise was a system. There were no planets capable of supporting ordinary life, but many xenogeneics still lived on them. Normal creatures relied on airships, unless they were strong enough to live in the inhospitable environment.\n\nAlthough Han Sen had his big white whale, he wasn\u2019t going to use it. After he entered Knight\u2019s Paradise, he saw that the system was occupied by a lot of Galactic Shrimp.\n\nHan Sen observed the Galactic Shrimp. They were mostly Duke class, but there were not many of them. Compared to the swarms of Galactic Shrimp in the systems of chaos, their numbers seemed almost pathetically small.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t go and kill the Galactic Shrimps. He flew straight to an orange planet instead. Before Han Sen entered the system, he did some research to ensure that he was well-prepared. He knew that the orange planet was full of stone and metal xenogeneics. Their defensive properties were quite impressive, and they were relatively rare. There was a lack of King xenogeneics there, though. Ordinary Royal Guards would have no interest in hunting on that planet.\n\nSince Han Sen was unwilling to go to the popular planets to hunt, he had far fewer things to worry about. The popular hunting grounds would have too many King class guards, and they would pose the biggest threat to him.\n\nKnight\u2019s Paradise was not King\u2019s Garden. Because only Royal Guards were allowed entry, they could get away with a lot more. Han Sen couldn\u2019t predict what might happen if he encountered others, particularly if they proved hostile.\n\nHan Sen landed on Planet King Kong, and he found himself surrounded by orange rocks as far as the eye could see. As the orange rocks aged, they slowly degraded into orange sand.\n\nBecause there was no atmosphere to support traditional lifeforms, the planet had no plant life. And that meant that the temperature of the planet\u2019s surface was very low, about two hundred kelvins. The gravity was a few times higher than that of most planets, too. Ordinary humans definitely couldn\u2019t live there.\n\nBut that sort of environment wouldn\u2019t affect a Duke. Han Sen touched down on the orange sand of the desert and started walking.\n\nBecause the xenogeneics were hidden in caves or beneath the dunes, he would have trouble spotting them if he flew. Because of this, he settled on walking.\n\nPlanet King Kong had many solo xenogeneics. They rarely operated in groups, which was one of the reasons why the other guards didn\u2019t like going there. If the King guards wanted many low-class xenogeneic genes, it would take a long time to collect them because of the independence of the xenogeneics.\n\nHan Sen kept walking and walking until he saw the sand rise around him. Something that was three meters long suddenly emerged from the sand."
