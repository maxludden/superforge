He decided to go to Ancient Devil Shelter. He didn\u2019t entirely believe Dragon King, but the creatures were indeed behaving strangely at the sound of that bell, and they were all headed in the same direction.\n\nAside from the Devil Fangs, Han Sen noticed many more creatures heading that way, too. They looked possessed, mindlessly going there.\n\nHan Sen was stuck inside that realm, so he thought he might as well go with them to see what was going on and test his luck.\n\nBesides, Han Sen still had firm control of Dragon King, and he did not believe the spirit could do anything to change that fact.\n\nHan Sen flew towards the buildings, far beyond the black mist, and as he was going, asked, \u201cWhat is that Qi Ling you mentioned?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you were born powerful, most spirits and creatures share the same fate as humans in this sanctuary. They have to practice, train, fight, and learn in order to grow and open their gene locks. Once you have reached your seventh gene lock, though, things become much harder.\u201d\n\nDragon King went on to say, \u201cThe Ancient Devil Bell can rinse their souls. While the emperor is present, each time it rings, creatures and spirits benefit immensely. If they have not unlocked seven of their gene locks, hearing the seventy-two bell tolls can result in the learning and opening of an additional two. Above seven? Well, that just depends on your luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds too good to be true. And maybe it is. Why has it not worked on me?\u201d Han Sen scoffed at the thought.\n\n\u201cYou are already so strong, and with the distance of the bell, it is no wonder why it has not worked,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s useless for me, then why must you implore that I go there?\u201d Han Sen still did not believe Dragon King.\n\nBut Dragon King said, \u201cWhile Ancient Devil Emperor still occupied that place, the ringing of the bell signified he was going to test the genes of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cGene testing?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t quite sure what he meant.\n\nHumans had technology to gauge the strength and level of people\u2019s genes, but he had never heard of spirits and creatures being able to do the same.\n\nHan Sen then conjured the image of a creepy uncle spirit, bringing a pretty, young spirit to a dark house, saying, \u201cCome, let me examine your jeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! Is Ancient Devil Emperor some sort of pervert!?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but speak this out loud.\n\nDragon King looked confused, and he asked, \u201cPervert? Who\u2019s a pervert? What are you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, nothing. Um, keep going. Tell me about all this gene testing\u2026\u201d Han Sen had no idea why he started thinking of the things he just had.\n\nDragon King then went on to say, \u201cThrough an examination, he was able to determine the flaws of someone\u2019s genes. He then provided advice on how to fix any discovered problems and how they might gain greater strength. What\u2019s perverted about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. That all sounds good.\u201d Han Sen coughed twice to hide his embarrassment over the outburst. Then, he shuffled the conversation along by saying, \u201cNow that he\u2019s gone, there\u2019s nobody there to run the tests anymore. Isn\u2019t that correct? Why do the creatures still go there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bell is a treasure. If it wasn\u2019t destroyed in the war, it should have been taken. But it is still there, ringing loudly.\u201d Dragon King was in deep thought.\n\nThe bell, by now, had rung almost fifty times. Han Sen was getting close, though, and he could make out the structure and buildings that composed the shelter. It was like a grand palace built atop the peak of a mountain.\n\nThere were supposed to be stairs leading up to the shelter, but they had been broken. Only fifty steps of the staircase remained, down near the bottom.\n\nThe palace was in poor condition, too. But despite its ravaged exterior, Han Sen could determine how grand and luxurious it must have been, once upon a time.\n\nMany creatures flew past Han Sen, not displaying a single ounce of hostility towards him.\n\nAll along the palace walls, and assembled on the palace grounds, were legions of creatures. They all stood still, not making a single noise.\n\n\u201cThe Ancient Devil Bell is a treasure of that emperor. Its ringing requires something special. It is not operated via a rope, so it\u2019s not something any person can do. And since all the creatures came here, just maybe\u2026\u201d Dragon King said.\n\n\u201cMaybe what?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King did not respond, so Han Sen flew high above the shelter. Looking down, he saw a hundred-thousand creatures inside the shelter.\n\nThe weakest creatures could only claim a spot on the rooftops, or were relegated to the shelter\u2019s walls. The strongest creatures were the ones closest to the palace.\n\nCreatures like Devil Fangs were situated atop the wall that circled the palace, as they weren\u2019t very strong.\n\nInside the palace, Han Sen saw six creatures. He saw the armored creature amongst them.\n\nThese six were inside the palace and seemed to possess some manner of authority. There was a distance separating them from the other creatures, who all had to remain outside.\n\nHan Sen checked out the other five creatures. One had a mostly humanoid shape, save for its tiger-head, four legs, and wings.\n\nIts body was mostly black, like obsidian, but glyph-like creeks of lava ran across its joints. This monster was holding a greataxe, which was as big as a house.\n\nTo the left of this creature, there was a red dog with two heads. The heads possessed horns. One head had one horn, whereas the other head had two.\n\nThe dog with two horns breathed ice, whereas the dog with one horn breathed fire."
