    "text": "\u201cLady Exquisite, can you tell which of the city\u2019s items are geno treasures?\u201d Han Sen asked Exquisite.\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cNo, but I can see something you cannot.\u201d\n\nHan Sen observed the anvil for a while, then he began to walk on down the street.\n\n\u201cAre you going to give up without even trying?\u201d Exquisite asked coldly when she caught up to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI bet that countless people from Sky Palace have already tried to take that anvil. I was standing there for a while, and the looks that the blacksmith was giving me weren\u2019t very friendly. I would rather go somewhere else where the reception is not so uninviting,\u201d Han Sen said as he looked around.\n\nAs Han Sen was checking out the city, the civilians in the city checked him out in return. The city wasn\u2019t big, and there weren\u2019t many people. They all lived there, so they knew each other well. Non-natives stood out quite a bit there.\n\nPlus, the people in that city were looking at Han Sen with hostile eyes. There was nothing warm or inviting about them. Han Sen could understand their attitude. In the past, Sky Palace students must have performed quite a few scams to steal their goods. These people certainly wouldn\u2019t enjoy outsiders coming in just to make off with their things.\n\nYun Changkong hadn\u2019t been willing to divulge the specifics of the Black King City to him. It was probably because Sky Palace students had done many things in that city that no one would be proud of.\n\nThe people of that old city didn\u2019t like outsiders, but they weren\u2019t picking any fights. They only walked around Han Sen with cold stares. It was likely they had been taken advantage of before.\n\nThe students of Sky Palace had their power restricted in the city, but they still had their physical strength. Ordinary creatures couldn\u2019t stand against power like that.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for Black King City\u2019s rules, any Sky Palace student could bring down the entire city with their fists.\n\n\u201cNo wonder Bo Qin said it was harder to get something in Black King City these days.\u201d Han Sen shook his head with a wry smile. He wasn\u2019t very good at talking, and his ability to communicate with others was below average. He didn\u2019t think he would gain much from this city.\n\nNow that he didn\u2019t have access to his powers, he was unable to tell which item was a treasure and which was just a normal item. He could only rely on his gut instincts and eyesight.\n\nHan Sen tried to summon a beast soul, but beast souls were restricted, as well. He couldn\u2019t bring anything out of his Sea of Soul. That stopped his cheating mind in its tracks.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, do you know what race the people here belong to? Why do they look like crystallizers?\u201d Han Sen said as he walked.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Exquisite said, \u201cThis is just their appearance. They aren\u2019t true crystallizers. They aren\u2019t like any race in this entire universe, actually. They are just creatures of the Black King City. They can\u2019t leave this place. They must spend their entire lives inside this city.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre the creatures in the other four cities similar to these?\u201d After Han Sen asked that, a strange feeling whelmed him. He was from Sky Palace, but he was asking an outsider about what might be members of his own species.\n\nExquisite didn\u2019t seem to give Han Sen\u2019s question much thought. She shook her head and said, \u201cEach of the five cities is different. The inhabitants all have special traits and quirks. The other cities aren\u2019t as safe as Black King City. Even deifieds can die in them with a little bad luck.\u201d\n\nHan Sen and Exquisite continued to walk and talk, sightseeing their way through the city. The grass, the wood, the bricks, and the slate of the region looked very old and heavy.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he was walking through the streets of a vintage film. Everything there looked like treasures, but they weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt sucks not having my ability to sense things,\u201d Han Sen sighed. But he suddenly remembered he had crystallizer glasses. He didn\u2019t know if the crystallizer technology would work in the city, so he gave it a try.\n\nHan Sen put the glasses on his face and looked at the people in the city. Data scrolled across the lenses.\n\n\u201cTarget locked\u2026 analyzing data\u2026\u201d the voice of Glasses sounded in Han Sen\u2019s ears. The data continued to flash across the lenses.\n\n\u201cWhy are you wearing glasses?\u201d Exquisite felt as if what Han Sen was doing was rather weird. She looked at the glasses.\n\nGlasses wasn\u2019t a treasure, so Exquisite wasn\u2019t surprised by his ability to put them on.\n\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t like us. Wearing glasses to hide our faces might help us steal items. They won\u2019t be able to immediately recognize me if I wear these,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\nWhen she heard Han Sen say that, Exquisite looked at the people and said, \u201cYou think too much. Anyone who takes an item from this place will be branded a threat, and they will never be able to come back.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and didn\u2019t respond. He continued walking. Not long later, Glasses had results ready for him.\n\nTarget: AT6-type mutant genes. Male. Calculated Gene Age: 34.\n\nGene level: none\n\nGene potential: none\n\n\u201cWhat is an AT6-type mutant gene?\u201d Han Sen asked the glasses in shock.\n\n\u201cAT indicates that it is a creature. The number six means it is from the sixth branch of creatures,\u201d Glasses answered.\n\n\u201cWhat does AT mean?\u201d Han Sen tried to ask it.\n\n\u201cAT is AT.\u201d The AI of the glasses had the maturity of a six-year-old. She was unable to answer Han Sen\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cAre they related to the crystallizers in any way?\u201d Han Sen changed his approach with his questions.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Glasses answered hastily.\n\nHan Sen asked her about a few other races that looked similar, but Glasses refuted each suggestion.\n\n\u201cCan I see what other AT creatures might exist?\u201d Han Sen asked, not willing to give up yet.\n\n\u201cInformation incomplete. Cannot answer,\u201d Glasses answered.\n\nSince he couldn\u2019t get any more information out of Glasses, Han Sen put his mind on the city.\n\nGlasses could be used, but she could only scan creatures. She didn\u2019t scan treasures, and so Han Sen would have to depend on his luck for any decisions he made on that prospect.\u201cIf you follow me to the Very High, I can tell you where a deified treasure lies and how to claim it for yourself,\u201d Exquisite said as two of them walked around the streets. Han Sen was coming up empty-handed thus far.\n\n\u201cWhere is a deified treasure?\u201d Han Sen asked her quickly.\n\nExquisite had been tricked by Han Sen once before. She looked at him silently, not willing to answer his question.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t trick her into giving him more information, so he shrugged and said, \u201cBut you should at least tell me what sort of treasure it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city is very small. If I told you what it is, you would find it.\u201d Exquisite rolled her eyes.\n\nHan Sen was surprised. It was rare to see her express that much emotion.\n\n\u201cNever mind, then.\u201d After a moment of thought, Han Sen decided to return to the blacksmith\u2019s smithy.\n\nSky Palace had controlled Black King City for many years. All the best stuff had probably been taken by this point. Even if there was something good left to get, it would be either extremely difficult to claim or impossible to find. So far, the anvil was the only thing Han Sen had seen that interested him. And so, that was what he was going to try to claim."
