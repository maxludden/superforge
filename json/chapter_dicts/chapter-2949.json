He wanted to suck the eyeless big beast into it.\n\nJust as the eyeless big beast was about to approach the sleeves, it suddenly stopped. The creature\u2019s mouth turned into a speaker in space. It blew wind at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat.\n\nDoo!\n\nIt sounded like a ship\u2019s foghorn. The moment the sound was heard, one saw shockwaves come out of the eyeless big beast. They came out like water waves that enveloped Sky Palace\u2019s first seat. The waves turned into a sonic ring that wrapped up Sky Palace\u2019s first seat\u2019s body.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s body\u2019s Very High power was madly running, but he could not break the grip of the sonic ring that had a hold of him. He was trapped by the sonic ring.\n\nThe eyeless big beast turned around with the intent to leave with the sonic ring pulling Sky Palace\u2019s first seat with him. They returned to the demon lady.\n\nOn the other side, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster had not been granted a moment to speak. The fish bird was too fast. The continuous attacks were too much for Ancient Abyss Grandmaster to deal with. He suddenly had lots of wounds. In the end, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster flashed away and retreated into the darkness. The fish bird chased him for a while but soon returned. Based on his expression, it was unlikely he managed to catch up with Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s geno arts are weird,\u201d the fish bird said upon his return. \u201cHe can travel around the barren powers. He managed to escape!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fine,\u201d the demon lady said. \u201cIt is not hard to guess what the Extreme King is doing here. Just ignore him.\u201d\n\nEveryone returned their attention to Han Sen. Sky Palace\u2019s first seat was struggling. He was incapable of escaping the power of the sonic ring that had snared him.\n\nThe demon lady stared at Han Sen and said, \u201cGive me the holy spirit, and I will permit you to live.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not answer her. He just measured them all with his eyes. In the image Old Cat had brought to him before, Han Sen had seen the demon girl and others. He knew he had come to the right place to find Littleflower.\n\n\u201cWe are asking you a question!\u201d Old Vulture madly shouted. \u201cStop being frozen!\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King quickly flashed behind Han Sen. He faced the demon lady and said, \u201cYou guys must believe me. It really was the master who asked me to protect Han Sen and lead him to the holy hall. The master\u2019s soul remains in the statue inside the holy garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarry on as you please and keep making up your story.\u201d Red Ghost coldly laughed. \u201cThe holy garden\u2019s statue is what the master prepared for Miss Wan\u2019er. Why would his soul be inside there?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King was frozen. He could not explain it. He thought in his heart, \u201cMaster, master, I would do anything for you and the person you love. But dying at the hands of our own people\u2026 This is terrible. Master, you were always so smart. How could you not foresee this happening?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King made a decision and said to Han Sen, \u201cMister Han, you should leave first. I will slow them down.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that, Old Vulture and Red Ghost laughed. \u201cSlow us down? How? Are you going to use your One Second Is a Thousand Years? Even if you squander all of your lifespan, how much can you truly delay us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Servant, you are very loyal to your new master.\u201d The demon lady looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOld Nine, you fall back,\u201d Han Sen said to Nine Thousand King, who was in front of him.\n\n\u201cMister Han\u2026\u201d Nine Thousand King wished to say something, but Han Sen stopped him.\n\nHan Sen signaled Nine Thousand King to fall back. He looked at the demon lady and asked, \u201cAre you Auntie Mei?\u201d\n\nThe demon lady, Old Vulture, and the others were shocked. The titles of Auntie Mei and Old Vulture were something they reserved for themselves. No one else should have known that.\n\nThat was especially true for Auntie Mei. It only started when Littleflower was there. Only Littleflower called her that. Old Vulture and the others just called her a horny woman.\n\n\u201cDo you know me?\u201d The demon lady frowned and looked at Han Sen. Now that she thought about it, he did look a bit familiar.\n\n\u201cI am Han Sen. I have come looking for Littleflower. Please, everyone, allow me to be with my son once again.\u201d Han Sen bowed before them. He was being polite. If it didn\u2019t work out, he would have to use force.\n\n\u201cYou are Han Sen!\u201d Auntie Mei and the others were shocked upon hearing that name.\n\nThey knew Littleflower\u2019s biological father was Han Sen. To them, it did not really matter who his father was, so they never cared about what Han Sen looked like. Even if they saw him on the street, they would not have recognized him. They would not have cared.\n\nOld Vulture\u2019s eyes were open wide as he looked at Han Sen. He screamed, \u201cYou are\u2026 Little Master\u2019s father?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King was frozen. He had no idea what had become of the situation. His brain could not function. He ended up saying, \u201cWhat does this mean? Old Vulture said Han Sen is the Little Master\u2019s father. That means Old Vulture has a new master, and the new master is Mister Han\u2019s son. Wait a minute\u2026\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s eyes turned bright. He suddenly thought of something. He slapped his legs and thought, \u201cI see it now. I see it now\u2026 I knew it. Master has it all prepared. He must have known this would happen\u2026 I see it now\u2026 Ha! Ha!\u201d\n\n\u201cI could not have foreseen this. I really couldn\u2019t have. Master and Mister Han had a child. With Old Vulture and the demon lady\u2019s personality, if it was not for the master\u2019s child, they would not have taken it as a leader. This must be right. Master wanted me to protect Little Master\u2019s father\u2026 Wait\u2026 No\u2026 Father? How could two fathers make a baby? Whatever\u2026 With the master\u2019s power, he can do anything!\u201d Nine Thousand King thought that seemed right. He thought he was saved.\n\nAfter Nine Thousand King thought of this, he started laughing. He laughed and said, \u201cYou are all family. Why are you still fighting? Hurry up and invite Mister Han into the holy palace.\u201d\n\nThe demon lady and the others all looked at each other. They did not know what to do about this. They never thought Littleflower\u2019s father, a guy who had come out of the sanctuaries without anyone\u2019s help, had become deified. On top of that, he had managed to claim old monsters like Nine Thousand King. Now, there he was, in Sacred, getting his son back. This was far beyond their expectation. They never thought this might happen.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat, who was trapped, was going to escape while they were fighting Nine Thousand King. Who would have known it would turn into a family reunion of sorts? And, Han Sen had become the new Sacred Leader\u2019s father. He was shocked.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean that child has become Sacred\u2019s new master\u2026\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat thought about Littleflower. He had wanted to take him to Sky Palace, but he accidentally let Han Sen escape. He did not expect that child to become the new master of Sacred.\n\nEverybody was thinking, but no one was speaking. The scene had become extremely strange."
