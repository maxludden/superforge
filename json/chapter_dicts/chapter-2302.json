    "text": "Out of all the royal children, it was rare for someone like Bai Wei\u2014especially at her age\u2014to not have visited The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a negative commentary on Bai Wei\u2019s skill, however. If she went to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings alone, she would have to be at least King class to pass the test.\n\nThe test in The Grave of Soldiers and Kings allowed the help of royal guards. Bai King had created a few of the tests to focus on the personal power of the royal children, but most of the tests focused on the collective power of the team.\n\nTo become an emperor, a person could not rely solely on their own power. Emperors needed the skill and authority to control others effectively.\n\nThe strongest ally that Bai Wei had was her butler. There were some other Marquise and Earl servants and knights in her employ, but Han Sen was her only official Royal Guard.\n\nBai Wei was having a bad time because Planet Wind Zone did not have enough resources to support the development of high-level knights. No one remotely powerful would follow a lowly royal like her.\n\nOn top of all that, Bai Wei wasn\u2019t held in high esteem by the common people. Because of that, the people who were willing to follow her weren\u2019t particularly outstanding.\n\nThe Grave of Soldiers and Kings allowed a royal to bring ten Royal Guards with them, but the guards had to be ranked Duke or lower. Han Sen\u2019s plan to bring the blood kirin was shot down immediately.\n\n\u201cSo, that means the only people that are useful here are you, me, and the butler.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nBai Wei shook her head. \u201cJust you and me, actually. Not the butler. The butler isn\u2019t a Royal Guard, so he isn\u2019t qualified to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.\u201d\n\nHan Sen gave her a wry smile. \u201cYou are using me as a stand-in for all ten Royal Guards? I should take the combined cut you\u2019d give all ten, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can get into The Grave of Soldiers and Kings, I will go half and half on the spoils with you,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\n\u201cThe Grave of Soldiers and Kings contains the weaponry of kings. Only one of the royals can take the stuff. How are we supposed to split what we find?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBai Wei laughed. \u201cOf course you cannot take a king\u2019s weapon, but the Grave contains more than just royal weapons. Otherwise, the princes and princesses would have taken it all away already. Many weapons have been left there simply to honor the dead. They are rare treasures, and Royal Guards are each allowed to take one of them. That way, you and I will both be able to take something.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that he could gain something from this venture, Han Sen felt much better.\n\nBai Wei went on to say, \u201cPlus, The Grave of Soldiers and Kings has more to offer than simply weapons. Passing through The Grave of Soldiers and Kings will qualify me to study in the King\u2019s Garden. That is the true benefit I seek. Royal Guards can follow me there to study, so that should be something that interests you, as well.\u201d\n\nAlthough Han Sen had only just come to the Extreme King, he had heard about the King\u2019s Garden before. There was a deified king tree there, and it was native to the King\u2019s Kingdom. In the daytime, the king tree released king air. Absorbing the king air could strengthen your body and genes. It was very helpful for nobles who wanted to level up.\n\nBut the king tree only released a limited amount of king air. Even royals were required to pass certain tests before they could enter the King\u2019s Garden and obtain some of the king air.\n\nAccess to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings was one of the requirements for entry. There were many other conditions, but Bai Wei had already met them. Passing through The Grave of Soldiers and Kings was the only challenge that Bai Wei been unsuccessful in completing.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what the test inside The Grave would be like. He couldn\u2019t promise Bai Wei that he could lead her through it successfully, so he planned on just having a look first.\n\nHowever, both Bai Wei and Han Sen were Duke class. She was confident in being able to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.\n\nHan Sen left Bao\u2019er, the blood kirin, and the little red bird behind on Planet Wind Area. Then, Han Sen and Bai Wei journeyed to The Grave.\n\nThe Grave of Soldiers and Kings was a planet. Han Sen and Bai Wei reached a space station in orbit above the planet, and Bai Wei completed the documentation while Han Sen waited in the lobby.\n\n\u201cThis poor queen. She has to do everything by herself.\u201d Han Sen sighed. He closed his eyes and tried to get a little rest. But he suddenly felt someone approach.\n\nMany people were coming and going from the lobby, but that person\u2019s presence caught Han Sen\u2019s attention. He opened his eyes.\n\nIt was a twenty-year-old man with an ordinary Extreme King face. His eyes were very stable. His whole body was like a knife that could be pulled out of a scabbard.\n\nThe man walked straight up to Han Sen. He stopped in front of Han Sen, his gaze direct. \u201cYou are Han Sen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am. What is your name?\u201d Han Sen asked warily. He had only just come to the Extreme King, but already someone was looking for him.\n\n\u201cBai Wuchang,\u201d the young man answered seriously.\n\nHearing that name, Han Sen was surprised. He thought, \u201cThis name is a bomb. I wonder what genius decided to give his son such an awesome name. Are they not afraid their son might die?\u201d\n\nBai Wuchang ignored Han Sen\u2019s hesitation. \u201cAre you the Han Sen that is affiliated with Lone Bamboo. The one with the title of knife and sword master?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am that Han Sen, but that title is just a name people use to make fun of me. You cannot take it seriously,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBai Wuchang nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, as long as you are the one. I wanted to fight Lone Bamboo, but I\u2019ve never gotten the chance. Since you are here, I will fight you first.\u201d\n\nBai Wuchang pulled a card out of his pocket and gave it to Han Sen. \u201cTake this card. I will wait for you inside tomorrow night.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bai Wuchang didn\u2019t wait for Han Sen to give a response. He simply left.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? I did not even give him an answer!\u201d Han Sen wanted to call after Bai Wuchang, but as he stepped forward, he realized that the man was already gone. He had walked out of the lobby and left the space station.\n\n\u201cWho was that guy?\u201d Han Sen looked at the card in his hand, assuming that it was a calling card. It was a black card with white text that simply read, \u201cBai Wuchang.\u201d There was nothing else. It said nothing about Bai Wuchang\u2019s position amongst the Extreme King.\n\nHan Sen looked at the card in his hands. Bai Wei walked toward him, having finished her paperwork, but her eyes widened when she saw the card. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was this guy called Bai Wuchang. He approached and gave me this card, and then he left,\u201d Han Sen said while holding the card.\n\nBai Wei looked glum. She quickly asked, \u201cIs he going to challenge you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod.\n\n\u201cThis is bad. How did he learn that you are here? And on top of that, he has the audacity to come and challenge you? He must be part of someone else\u2019s plan,\u201d Bai Wei said while nibbling her lips.\n\n\u201cWho is this Bai Wuchang? Is he famous?\u201d Han Sen asked casually.\n\nBai Wei sighed and said, \u201cHe is my brother, and he is a prince. And he is the son of the empress. But unlike most princes, he has little in the way of authority. He only wants to level up. Even Father says he is one of our most talented princes. It is hard to predict how he will grow in the coming years.\u201d"
