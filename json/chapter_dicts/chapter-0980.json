It seemed as if its fight with Yaksha had been a brutal one. But even though it was injured, if it still sought to pick a fight with him, Han Sen couldn\u2019t use super king spirit mode or even hope to beat it.\n\n\u201cThis kid is cute\u2026\u201d Han Sen patted the little dragon\u2019s head and looked awkward, all in an attempt to hide what he had been doing.\n\nRoar! The silver dragon roared at Han Sen.\n\nA gust of spittle and wind blew Han Sen back a few steps.\n\nThe saliva that now caked him made him sick, and an overwhelming stench of fish rolled over him.\n\nHan Sen thought this signaled a need to fight, but all the dragon did was roar. It didn\u2019t do anything else, and perhaps that was because he had freed it from incarceration, earlier.\n\nThe baby white dragon happily ran over to the silver dragon and jumped on its back. It, too, then roared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you two have been reunited with each other. He looked lost in these tunnels, you see, and\u2026 well, I have an errand to run. I best get going!\u201d Han Sen hoped to sneak away after the two were together again.\n\nBut then another gust of dragon-breath knocked Han Sen off his feet and sent him hurtling against the tunnel wall. A fresh layer of saliva gelled his entire body.\n\nThe silver dragon gave Han Sen one last look, then returned to the ocean with the small white dragon atop it.\n\nFrom the silver dragon\u2019s back, the white dragon turned to shout at Han Sen one last time, too.\n\n\u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be too greedy.\u201d Han Sen then started trying to wipe the slime of saliva from his body. For now, he was just glad the silver dragon had chosen to spare him, and there\u2019d be no need for another fight.\n\n\u201cIf the dragon came back, that must mean it won. I wonder if that Yaksha was killed, then?\u201d Han Sen hoped he was dead, for only then would he truly be safe.\n\nHan Sen continued through the tunnels and started following more and more waterstreams in the hopes one would lead him to the surface. The rivers were still too long, and the labyrinth was still too complex for him to navigate. All he could do was guess a direction and hope for the best, because he had no idea where he had come from and where he was going.\n\nBut then, suddenly, Han Sen saw a white shadow appear. Much to his relief, it was the Red-Eye Rabbit king.\n\nHan Sen was made very glad, so he decided to chase after it.\n\nThis couldn\u2019t have been the first time the rabbit had come here, and surely it wouldn\u2019t be lost like he was. By following the rabbit, he thought he might have a chance of getting out.\n\nThe rabbit king was on its way someplace, and it moved steadily. As such, Han Sen keenly followed.\n\nAfter a long while of walking, he finally encountered other rabbits, and this told him he\u2019d soon be free of the place.\n\nThe rabbit eventually led him out of the caves, and once again, Han Sen found himself in the canyon from before. He had come out a different way than he had gone in, though.\n\nBut after exiting the cave, Han Sen frowned. Scattered all about were the corpses of countless dead rabbits.\n\nAll the dead bodies had a hole in their head, as if something had bored through their heads to consume the brain and nothing else. The corpses were just left behind to rot.\n\n\u201cIs this Yaksha\u2019s doing? Was Yaksha not killed?\u201d Han Sen felt as if his presence there had left a dark imprint, and it made him shudder. As disappointed as he was in the thought that the man might still be alive, he knew he\u2019d now have to exercise more caution.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen couldn\u2019t feel him in the nearby vicinity. It must have left the area, and for that, Han Sen was thankful.\n\nThen, as if it was greatly upset, Han Sen saw the white rabbit hopping and skipping between all the murdered rabbits. Feeling bad for the creature, he decided to pick it up.\n\n\u201cFollow me home; at least you won\u2019t have to worry about being killed.\u201d Han Sen held the rabbit and left the canyon.\n\nThe rabbit seemed useless, but at least he could keep it around as a sort of pet. Leaving the clumsy thing here, it would surely not last very long.\n\nHan Sen made his way back to the shelter, but throughout his return, he was in a constant state of alert. He didn\u2019t want to run into Yaksha again, and fortunately, he didn\u2019t.\n\nHan Sen did not dare leave the shelter again, in fear of Yaksha, who would relish the chance to finish him off. For now, he wanted to focus on his Dongxuan Sutra and open more of its gene locks.\n\nHe had the ability to unlock four now. His fitness level had gone up quite a bit, and it had quickly outpaced his opening of gene locks.\n\nHe entered the teleporter with the rubix cube in hand. Much to his surprise, he was able to bring it with him.\n\nHe scanned the computer and tasked his computer with figuring it out for him. It would have been an extremely difficult task for him to do, so it was far easier for him to just allow the computer to sort it out.\n\nNot long after, the rubix cube was done. There were six sides, each containing a different picture and words from an ancient language.\n\nEach picture contained a different naked woman, and red and blue lines were drawn across each of their bodies. They were like arteries and veins, almost.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, the pictures told a different story.\n\nHan Sen did not know what the lines meant, but the ancient words were too small for him to see, and he had to zoom-in to read them.\n\nThe ancient words were similar to that of the Dongxuan Sutra. Fortunately, he had spent time studying and learning ancient languages recently. Luckily, he could now read it.\n\nAfter reading the words upon the rubix cube, Han Sen\u2019s face contorted a little. He was perplexed. It was an ancient Qi Gong, transcribed across the puzzle, and it was called Wedding Dress Skill.\n\nThe Qi Gong seemed powerful, and there were ten gene locks to open with it. But it was different from the Dongxuan Sutra, in that there was only one function and it remained at the same tier no matter how many gene locks were open. After reaching new tiers and opening more gene locks, the Dongxuan Sutra provided its user with new skills and improved pre-existing skills. Therefore, Wedding Dress Skill was indeed quite different. Still, it was clearly an improvement over the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nThe max number of gene locks to open with Wedding Dress skill was ten gene locks. The Dongxuan Sutra had more than that though, and that was the difference.\n\nAs a surpasser, Wedding Dress Skill was clearly the best you could get. There were only five known hyper geno arts that could allow the opening of at least ten gene locks.\n\nThose five skills did not include the Dongxuan Sutra or the Blood-Pulse Sutra, either. But now, there was another, and that was called Wedding Dress Skill.\n\nIt was a strange skill, though. It was said only a woman could practice it, and only virgins, too.\n\nWhat was even stranger, if a woman was in the process of learning it, they could jump straight to the tenth gene lock if it meant ensuring a man who was committing a Life-and-Death Breakthrough would succeed. But after that, the skill would be destroyed, and the memory of its learning would be gone."
