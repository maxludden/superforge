She thought about what Han Sen had told her, and complex emotions washed over her.\n\n\u201cBrother Han is\u2026 He\u2019s too strong\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Exquisite is trash before Father Han. What kind of Very High is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo scary. The siblings of the Han family are monsters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is too cruel. He even bullied the crap out of a Very High student.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose punches were way too awesome. I never liked the Very High, and they wanted to take Brother Han and Brother Lone Bamboo to be their slaves. And see? They don\u2019t even have what it takes!\u201d\n\nThe blood of the Sky Palace students was boiling. The Very High always acted as if the Sky were inferior to them. Right now, as they watched Han Sen destroy Exquisite, they were filled with glee. They all wished they could batter the Very High in the same way Han Sen could.\n\n\u201cCan this fight end now?\u201d Han Sen turned back to Exquisite, who was still sitting on the ground at the edge of the arena. She was staring right at him.\n\nExquisite seemed to have been startled from a deep slumber. As she stared at Han Sen, resolve settled into her eyes.\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t over yet. The universe is still on my side. I won\u2019t lose, especially not to you.\u201d Exquisite slowly stood up. Her hair rose and waved in the air, despite the absence of wind. Her tai chi eyes spun dangerously, and the black and white colors glowed. Her aura began to spread ominously, forming black and white airs out of her body. They began to spin together, forming the structure of a substance chain.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s forcing her nine tiers to become one. She is becoming half-deified right now!\u201d The realization rolled through the arena like a thunderclap.\n\nBzzt!\n\nAs everyone reeled from the shock, Exquisite\u2019s black and white air exploded. Black geno armor appeared and encased her whole body. Her face was shielded, too. Only her Very High Eye could be seen. As this happened, her Very High Eye turned pure white. It was like a small nuclear reactor, and a scary power was emerging.\n\nAt this same moment, Exquisite\u2019s presence was being pushed to a level that others couldn\u2019t imagine. She was like a scary monster queen, and she used her third eye to look icily at Han Sen.\n\nExquisite turned to Han Sen and raised her hand. She made a pulling motion. She didn\u2019t seem to release any power, but the whole of space shifted. It was as if the space between the two fighters had been severely reduced. Instantly, Han Sen\u2019s body was pulled directly in front of Exquisite\u2019s hands. Exquisite grabbed him by the neck.\n\n\u201cNo one can beat me in my universe!\u201d Exquisite used the white flame in her third eye to look at Han Sen while she spoke.\n\nAfter that, Exquisite grabbed Han Sen by the neck. Her body began to generate a frightening black and white power. It felt as if all the power in the universe was draining into her hands. If she even twitched, she would surely break Han Sen\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cNow I will give you the chance to concede,\u201d Exquisitely said to Han Sen as she looked at him. Her face looked like it had been carved from marble. Her voice was a dead monotone, like the grinding of a machine. It was as if she would be happy to turn Han Sen\u2019s body to dust if he failed to agree.\n\n\u201cI still prefer it when you smile. This look doesn\u2019t suit you,\u201d Han Sen said, frowning slightly at Exquisite.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you to concede!\u201d Exquisite thundered. Her black and white air rose madly like two ravenous demons. It was like they were going to ravage Han Sen\u2019s body and consume him. Not even a single bone would be left behind.\n\n\u201cNo one can force me to do something I don\u2019t think is right,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen and didn\u2019t speak. Her face remained entirely expressionless. The black and white powers in the air became stronger. It looked as if they were on the verge of exploding any second.\n\nThe Sky Palace students looked at Han Sen with worry. Yun Suyi fidgeted nervously with the hem of her dress. Her nails almost shredded her garments, and she was starting to sweat.\n\n\u201cShould we\u2026\u201d The woman looked at Sky Palace Leader.\n\nSky Palace Leader shook his head. \u201cWait a bit longer.\u201d\n\nAs he watched Exquisite rage, Han Sen wasn\u2019t mad. He just felt sorry for her.\n\nShe had given up her emotions so she could become one with the universe. To put it nicely, it was like the Sky and humans had combined. To be frank, though, it was more like she had become a pawn of the universe. She had thrown away her identity to become a high-class creature.\n\nHan Sen had seen people experience similar changes before in Sky Palace, but that had been very different from what he was seeing now. When the Sky became one with the sky, they focused a lot more on their emotions. It wasn\u2019t like the Very High, who only cared about being one with the universe.\n\n\u201cIf the Very High ever became 100% united with the universe, would they still count as individual people?\u201d Han Sen shook his head. There were many things he was unsure of, but he knew for certain that he never wanted that future. He couldn\u2019t take this path.\n\nExquisite stood in front of him, and her power raged higher and higher. Han Sen laid his hand against the fist that Exquisite was using to squeeze his neck. She lost her grip on Han Sen\u2019s throat.\n\nThe white light in Exquisite\u2019s eyes spilled over. Her black and white airs erupted like a volcano. Her other hand flew toward Han Sen like a bullet.\n\nHer black and white air was generating a substance chain on that fist. That fist was so strong that every face in Sky Palace changed. Yun Suyi was so nervous that it felt like her heart was going to leap out of her chest at any moment.\n\nThe two fighters were at very close range, and the power that Exquisite wielded was frightening. If Han Sen got punched, his body would be destroyed.\n\nThe next second, however, the crowd noticed that Han Sen\u2019s hands were moving as well. He grabbed Exquisite\u2019s fist, and then, both of her hands fell under Han Sen\u2019s control.\n\nThat scary black and white air began to shred Han Sen\u2019s hands. Deep grooves were torn into Han Sen\u2019s Spell armor. Blood came gushing out from the lacerations.\n\nThe scary black and white air stormed through the arena. Han Sen was at the center of the storm, with his armor taking the brunt of it. Wounds kept appearing across his body.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Against another of the same level, I am king. The only things that can fall to a king are smiles and a woman\u2019s beauty. Using force against me just won\u2019t do,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he tightened his fists with new strength. He threw Exquisite\u2019s black and white air-surrounded body away.\n\nHan Sen moved with the arc of her toss. He swung his fists like a hurricane.\n\nBeneath the force of Han Sen\u2019s blows, the black and white air was waning. Han Sen\u2019s punches pummeled Exquisite\u2019s black armor.\n\nPang! Pang!\n\nThe collision of fists against armor produced sharp, striking noises. They were so fast, there was hardly a break between each sound."
