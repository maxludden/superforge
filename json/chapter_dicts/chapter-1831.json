    "text": "Even the Knife Blank has come out. Is it useful?\u201d Han Sen waved the Knife Blank. It felt good to wield, but it didn\u2019t seem to\n\npossess any strange powers.\n\nBlack Steel looked at the Knife Blank and said, \u201cIt fell down like that without fear, so it is indeed something special. It will be a King class if it can become a real knife.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Black Steel ignored Han Sen. He went towards the knife mountain in search of another knife.\n\n\u201cIt sounds really good. How might I complete it, then? Your family is one of blacksmiths, right? Couldn\u2019t you help me forge it?\u201d Han Sen asked Black Steel.\n\n\u201cThis is a knife growing in Knife Grave. It has life. It isn\u2019t a simple material I can use for forging. I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Black Steel answered.\n\nEver since the twelfth rain fell, the Knife Grave had stopped erupting. There were no more knife rains as a result.\n\nBlack Steel scaled the mountain, and he searched for over six hours. Finally, he found the King class weapon he had been looking for.\n\nAs they fervently searched on the inside, the people on the outside grew increasingly worried. This was especially true of Black Steel\u2019s father, Black-Moon King. Black Steel had been overdue by many hours, and he still hadn\u2019t come out. It made\n\nBlack-Moon King\u2019s forehead sweat profusely.\n\n\u201cI am afraid they will be unable to return. At this time, a fifteenth rain will have come. At that strength, not even a Duke would stand a chance of repelling it\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were too greedy. They should have come out by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Black-Moon King. He only has one son.\u201d\n\nAs everyone discussed the matter, a white light emerged from the pit of the black hole. Two people soon came out, shocking everyone there.\n\nIt was Han Sen and Black Steel. Black-Moon King was made incredibly happy, but only for a single second. Then, so coldly, he asked, \u201cWhy are you only conning out now? What did you get?\u201d\n\nBlack Steel and Han Sen were shocked to see so many people had been waiting on them. Black Steel heard Black-Moon King\u2019s question, and so he brought out his new weapon, drew it, and presented it to him. He said, \u201cPlease take a look, Father.\u201d\n\nWhen Black-Moon King saw the knife, he froze. He didn\u2019t pick it up, and he had to try to contain his excitement. With forced calmness, he said, \u201cThis is your knife. Activate it yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Black Steel spoke with respect, and then he inserted his power into it.\n\nThe knife Black Steel had brought out looked a little weird. It had been made of bone, from the looks of it. The body of the blade was very straight, but also four feet long. The width of the blade was greater than a man\u2019s hand.\n\nBlack Steel held it with both of his hands. He put his Baron power inside of it, and then the bone knife roared the roar of a dragon.\n\nAnd then, swordlight flashed across the sky like a dragon in flight. It roared and zoomed around.\n\nBuzz! Buzz!\n\nEveryone present, who was carrying a knife, looked down as their weapons made strange noises. All the other knives were responding to the bone knife.\n\n\u201cKing class knife?\u201d Everyone was shocked, and Black-Moon King laughed out loud.\n\nHis son had found a King class weapon. In all the time the Rebate had controlled Narrow Moon, such an event had never occurred.\n\nThroughout all those years, with many Rebate and many different races, so many talented people had gone there. And yet, none had ever emerged with a King class weapon. But this time, it had happened. Black-Moon King\u2019s son had done it, and that weapon had accepted his son as its rightful bearer. Black Steel was weak, and he couldn\u2019t use the weapon\u2019s true strength, but as he grew up, it would adjust. They would grow and become more accustomed to one another, until one day, all of its power could be unleashed.\n\nThis was something so many people could only ever dream of accomplishing. Black-Moon King wanted to laugh his head off. He was thinking he\u2019d dream of laughing, too.\n\n\u201cBlack Steel, what will you name it?\u201d Black-Moon King asked with a smile.\n\n\u201cI would like to name it Dragon\u2019s Back,\u201d Black Steel said, as he sheathed the weapon.\n\n\u201cDragon\u2019s Back. Good. Good. Good. Ha! Ha!\u201d Black-Moon King said good three times, and then laughed.\n\n\u201cBlack-Moon King, congratulations!\u201d Many other Kings congratulated Black-Moon King.\n\nBringing out a King class weapon, and then getting approved by it, was a grand achievement. It was a big thing for Black- Moon King, and it looked like Black Steel could be a candidate for becoming the master of the Eleventh Star.\n\nEven Moon-Wheel King and Yisha nodded. Black Steel\u2019s luck and growth were good for the future of the Rebate.\n\nAfter a while, people realized another person had emerged from the tunnel.\n\nBlack-Moon King was in a good mood, and so he smiled at Han Sen and said, \u201cHan Sen, what did you bring with you? Let us take a look.\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at Han Sen. He and Black Steel had come out together, so there was a chance he had gotten a King class weapon, as well. The chance of that happening would be slim, though. You would need much luck and travel to find one. You couldn\u2019t get it by just standing there. But the longer you stayed in that land, the higher the chance you would have of being able to find one.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t deny what he had earned. He was going to draw it out, as it was a requirement for everyone\u2019s weapon to be registered. Hiding it would be pointless.\n\nBut as he clutched the handle, he felt as if something was wrong.\n\nThe Knife Blank had been like steel. It was really rough, and it felt as if Han Sen was clutching a coarse rod. But the handle Han Sen grabbed now was very delicate. It was like the tusk of an elephant It did not feel like the Knife Blank it had been earlier.\n\nHan Sen frowned and drew it out. It was not the Knife Blank he had seen earlier.\n\nThe knife he was holding gave off a purple mist. It was a scimitar, and it looked like the fang of a devil. The knife looked as if it was something made from solidified bad luck. It looked like your blood would be drained by that knife.\n\nHan Sen turned around and looked. The knife was still on his back. He felt weird and thought, \u201cOh no! Why is there another knife? Where did this come from? I thought people said only one knife could be carried out. If I knew I could bring more than one, I\u2019d have brought enough for my Mom, Wife, Son, Sister, Grandson, Little Angel, and Xie Qing.\u201d\n\nSeeing Han Sen\u2019s knife, Black-Moon King\u2019s expression became strange. He said, \u201cHan Sen, see if you can activate this power.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded, and then he put his strength into the devil-looking fang."
