    "text": "On his way to Planet Wind Zone, Han Sen sent a coded message.\n\nHan Sen took a deep breath before typing in the number that he wanted to send the message to. It was the number that Mister White had given him.\n\nMister White had told him that if there was an emergency, he could send a coded message to that number. Then, he would find a way to contact Han Sen back.\n\nThe code was simple. Rather than explaining exactly what had happened, Han Sen simply said that there was an emergency.\n\nAfter sending the message, Han Sen waited patiently. Half an hour later, his communicator came to life. An unknown number had sent him a message.\n\nHan Sen opened it. Again, this message was written in code. Han Sen read it and understood what he was being told.\n\n\u201cGo along with it. The information you need is in his house, and you must go there tonight,\u201d Han Sen read, and his jaw hit the floor. Mister White knew that Han Sen had killed Bai Yi, and on top of that, he knew that Han Sen was currently disguising himself as Bai Yi. When the message said \u201chis house,\u201d it must have been referring to Bai Yi\u2019s home.\n\nEven with his coded message translated, no one would know what the message was referring to.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t know how Mister White had found out, Mister White wanted him to keep pretending. And that meant he might succeed with the ruse.\n\nThe information Mister White was alluding to had to be information concerning Bai Yi. If Han Sen managed to get that information, he might learn more about Bai Yi. And that would make the charade easier for him.\n\nThe major problem at the moment was that he didn\u2019t know anything about Bai Yi. He currently didn\u2019t even know where the man lived. He didn\u2019t know if anyone else lived in the man\u2019s home or if he had any friends. He didn\u2019t have a single clue. If he just went there boldly, Han Sen feared his identity would be exposed.\n\nAnd as for the information Mister White was talking about, Han Sen didn\u2019t know where to find it.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived back at Planet Wind Zone, Mister White hadn\u2019t sent any more follow-up messages. He had already given Han Sen all the help he would be able to. Now, Han Sen just had to do whatever he could.\n\nHan Sen looked up some information on Bai Yi, but what he found wasn\u2019t very detailed. He was King Bai\u2019s sixteenth son. He was good at manipulating water, and he was a very arrogant man. His mother was a Siren, but she had died many years ago.\n\nHan Sen felt relieved. If Bai Yi\u2019s mother was still around, she would probably have exposed Han Sen the moment he met her.\n\nAnd in regards to King Bai, Han Sen wasn\u2019t really worried. King Bai had many children and grandchildren. Aside from the ones that he truly cherished, few ever saw him.\n\nBai Yi wasn\u2019t one of the favored children. The Siren civilization had been destroyed, and Bai Yi\u2019s mother had run to the Extreme King afterward. King Bai made her one of his wives. Bai Yi had no one living to support him, so he was just a run-of-the-mill prince.\n\nBai Yi\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t too shabby, but he wasn\u2019t very famous amongst the princes. His temper was foul, and he was a very arrogant individual. He was greedy, too. He didn\u2019t have much, and he wasn\u2019t fond of his father, either. Because of that, his development was stunted.\n\nAlthough Bai Yi was older than Bai Wei, he hadn\u2019t actually gone much farther than she had. His planet had helped him become King class, but that was about it. There were no more resources that would allow him to get better.\n\nThat was all Han Sen was able to learn. As for who was on Bai Yi\u2019s planet and what friends he might have had, that was information he couldn\u2019t learn on the internet.\n\nAnd as for what the planet looked like and what sort of buildings were there, Han Sen hadn\u2019t a clue. He hadn\u2019t seen a single image of the place.\n\nWhen he arrived on Planet Wind Zone, Han Sen ran to where the blood kirin was living. Bai Wei was currently still practicing in King\u2019s Garden, so she wasn\u2019t on Planet Wind Zone right then. Han Sen gathered Bao\u2019er, the blood kirin, and the little red bird, then they left the planet and took a ship to Bai Yi\u2019s Planet Water Zone.\n\nPlanet Water Zone lived up to its name. The whole planet was covered in water, or at least most of it was. A few islands were visible, but they were easy to overlook.\n\nThere were many creatures living in its sea, and Bai Yi\u2019s water element body was a good match for practicing there. Overall, it was a pretty nice planet.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t see any towns on the planet\u2019s surface. He surmised that it must have been underwater.\n\nHan Sen was growing nervous. He didn\u2019t know where to find Bai Yi\u2019s underwater city. If he just randomly started poking around, he\u2019d look like a pretty shady character.\n\nIf he was Bai Yi, there was no way he would have forgotten the way home. He wouldn\u2019t just dive into the sea and swim around aimlessly.\n\nHan Sen entered Planet Water Zone\u2019s atmosphere, trying to figure out what he should do. Suddenly, someone jumped out of the water to greet Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Why have you come to Planet Water Zone?\u201d the person shouted at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen looked at the woman, taking in her blue hair and unusual body. The lady didn\u2019t look like one of the Extreme King. Her ears were like the blue gills of a fish. She had no proper legs, either. Her lower body was the tail of a fish. She looked like one of the Ghana, but just a bit different.\n\n\u201cThis must be one of the Siren,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember your prince?\u201d Han Sen shouted coldly. He used his Original Water King Body and cast a water area-of-effect to bind the Siren lady and pull her towards him.\n\n\u201cMy prince\u2026 is that you?\u201d The Siren lady\u2019s eyes opened wide. She looked at Han Sen in shock. \u201cMy prince! You used Return to Origin?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you know that I have, then do not waste my time. Hurry down and tidy up. I\u2019m going to need some privacy for a while as I take over the body,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he released the water AoE and let the Siren lady go free.\n\nThe Siren lady looked frightened, and she said, \u201cYes, I will do it.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she flicked her tail and went swimming back into the depths of the sea.\n\nHan Sen silently followed her. He swam into the ocean and soon saw an underwater city residing beneath the waves. It was like something out of a fairytale.\n\nThe entire city was wrapped in a holy blue light that separated it from the water. It looked rather amazing.\n\n\u201cOf course. The environment here is far better than the environment of Planet Wind Zone,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He followed the girl into the underwater city.\n\nSurprisingly, when he entered, he found that the pretty underwater city was actually dirty and full of garbage. Many buildings were run-down and dilapidated.\n\nMillions could have lived in that underwater city, but when he entered the city proper, there was no one living there aside from the Siren lady, whose name was Lilly.\n\n\u201cIt looks like this Prince Sixteen wasn\u2019t living a good life, either,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself."
