    "text": "Because Han Sen was uncertain of Miss Mirror\u2019s ultimate goal, he didn\u2019t dare take any obvious risks. He remained on Planet Water Zone and spent his time hunting down Duke xenogeneics. He wanted to fill up his Duke genes.\n\nHan Sen found a few Duke xenogeneics, killed them, and consumed their Duke genes. Their xenogeneic genes increased his Duke gene tally by one point each, so leveling up was a very slow process. It wasn\u2019t as fast as eating one King xenogeneic gene to claim ten Duke gene points.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to cause much of a ruckus. He needed to be patient and slowly trawl through Planet Water Zone in the hunt for Duke xenogeneics.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen came across a little mountain moving across the bottom of the sea. It slid forward at a very slow pace, but Han Sen could tell that it really was moving.\n\nWhen Han Sen rode the blood kirin down to get a better look, he realized that it wasn\u2019t actually a mountain. It was a conch. The shell was one hundred meters tall. It was black and greyish, and it looked like stone from a distance.\n\nBeneath the conch, the white skirt of the conch was revealed. It was slowly flapping and moving across the sand.\n\nFeeling Han Sen and the blood kirin draw near, the mountainous conch moved its flesh and released a blue light. It covered an area of one thousand meters, cloaking Han Sen and the blood kirin at the same time.\n\nThe blood kirin was angered. His blood air exploded out from him as he thundered toward the sea conch.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what the sea conch\u2019s area did. It didn\u2019t seem to affect Han Sen directly. The blood kirin soon came before the sea conch, though, with that blood air swirling all around him.\n\nThe sea conch retreated back into its shell as the blood kirin\u2019s claws skittered across the hard surface of the shell, leaving some scratch marks across it.\n\nThe blood kirin roared in fury. It kept swinging its claws at the conch, trying to break through the shell. But despite its strength, the blood kirin couldn\u2019t leave behind anything more than light scratches. The conch shell was one hundred meters tall, so those scratches were inconsequential.\n\n\u201cA King class xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen was delighted by this discovery. If its shell was that sturdy, the creature must have been King class. A weak King class, judging by its fleshy body, but a King class nonetheless.\n\nThe blood kirin continued striking the shell, but each blow left less and less of a mark. It was rather confusing to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and swiped across the shell. It did nothing, and his performance paled in comparison to the blood kirin\u2019s.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He pulled out his Thunder God Spike, summoned its lightning, then thrust it toward the sea conch\u2019s shell. He wanted to paralyze the beast. After that, he could flip it on its back and slay it from below.\n\nBut the creature\u2019s shell seemed to insulate it perfectly from the lightning of the Thunder God Spike. That made Han Sen raise an eyebrow. \u201cThis guy\u2019s shell is really hard. But it is so big. I bet it would make an amazing armor.\u201d\n\nThe shell was far too large to be used for a single set of armor. Still, it would make an excellent construction material for something larger.\n\nBefore Han Sen could make something out of it, though, he first had to kill it. He tried all sorts of different powers, but his strongest attack could only deliver a mark that was a few inches across. It had no effect on the sea conch.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s flip it!\u201d Han Sen called to the blood kirin. Gathering their strength, they turned the sea conch over. After flipping it, though, they realized it was sealed on the bottom. There was no way in. The opening was blocked by the same material that composed the rest of the shell.\n\nAs they looked over the creature again, Han Sen and the blood kirin realized that the marks they had left on its shell had vanished. Their efforts had been wasted.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. This guy probably has a third-tier area. How else could the conch shell be so hard? Even the blood kirin, with an attack at full power, only leaves a small mark\u2026\u201d Han Sen looked around at the blue lights of the area that was all around. \u201cHow does this conch have such a powerful king area?\u201d\n\nThey had been there for a long time, but the blue light hadn\u2019t done any damage to Han Sen or the blood kirin. It certainly wasn\u2019t meant as an attack.\n\n\u201cIs this a weakening area, perhaps?\u201d Han Sen considered the possibility, but it didn\u2019t seem quite right.\n\nIf it was a weakening area, he should have been able to feel his own power losing strength. Han Sen wasn\u2019t sensing any energy drain, though; his body was full of vigor.\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t a weakening type, then could it be a cell-strengthening type? Does the blue light increase the shell\u2019s strength?\u201d Han Sen stroked his jaw as he thought about this, but he ultimately discarded this idea as well.\n\nIf it was a cell-strengthening area, the sea conch wouldn\u2019t have needed to release the light into such a large area. The wider the area, the more spread out the power would be. The cell-strengthening area would only be required around the shell itself. Why would the creature need to extend its reach so far?\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t a weakening or a cell-strengthening area, what is it?\u201d Han Sen stared at the sea conch as he mulled over the conundrum.\n\nThe blood kirin had a short temper, and its inability to damage the sea conch\u2019s shell was making the blood kirin more and more furious. It kept trying to bite the shell, but nothing worked. The marks they left were becoming lighter and lighter.\n\n\u201cHang on\u2026 The blood kirin\u2019s power hasn\u2019t weakened. In fact, his anger has made him even stronger. Why are his scratch marks becoming lighter?\u201d Han Sen stared at the scratch marks on the conch shell. After a while, his eyes sparkled. \u201cIs his area power\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen swam next to the conch shell and stroked the scratch marks across its surface. The blood kirin stopped attacking.\n\nNot long after, the scratch marks were gone. The healing unfolded before their eyes.\n\nIf even a top-class half-deified creature like the blood kirin couldn\u2019t break the conch\u2019s shell, then the shell was unbelievably hard.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think that the strength was coming from the material of the shell, though. The conch shell was very hard, but its incredible resistance was because of the creature\u2019s King area.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if his guess was correct, so after a moment of thought, he took the blood kirin and left. They departed the sea conch\u2019s area of blue light.\n\nThe sea conch behaved as if it knew what they were doing. It spread the blue light further, but the max range was two thousand meters. It couldn\u2019t extend the light beyond that.\n\nWhen Han Sen and the blood kirin got far enough away that the sea conch couldn\u2019t feel their presence, they hid behind a big rock, Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the sea conch in the distance.\n\nThe sea conch waited there for a while. It must have been almost half an hour before the creature emerged from the shell to look around. After a while, when it didn\u2019t see Han Sen and the blood kirin in the vicinity, it shut off its blue light.\n\nUpon seeing that, Han Sen summoned Spell. He turned her into a sniper rifle and took aim at the sea conch.\n\nPang!\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen squeezed the trigger. The bullet fired out of the barrel and broke through the water. It was silently headed for the sea conch."
