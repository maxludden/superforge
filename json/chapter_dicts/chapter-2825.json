    "text": "Han Sen thought, Has this scroll recorded the elites that killed gods before? He thought something was amiss with what was going on.\n\nSacred Leader researched for a long time and was unable to kill the gods. Why would a subordinate of his, Purple Fight, kill a god with success? That is so weird. Plus, that woman and Horizontal Evil used to say that without a super gene, you could not kill a god. Even Sacred Leader was unable to find a super gene. How did Purple Fight find a super gene? Han Sen's brain was flooded with intense wonder.\n\nTo find an answer in the scroll, Han Sen added power into his hands to pull the scroll open even more.\n\nThe scroll was hard to open. It was like it was glued shut. It took a lot of power to get it open. The more he pulled it, the harder it became. With Han Sen's larva class power, even he almost couldn't hold it open.\n\nThere are more words... Horizontal Evil... Killing the gods... When Han Sen saw the name, he froze.\n\nHorizontal Evil was the Breakskies alpha. Han Sen had pinned him on a mountainside a while ago. He was never granted death, so he was stuck in a state of not living and not dying. Horizontal Evil even told Han Sen that he did not have the power to eliminate a god. If that was true, why did the scroll possess words that suggested the contrary?\n\nHan Sen suddenly thought the scroll was Holy Kirin's prank. Otherwise, having such a list of names was pointless. Was he giving Purple Fight, Horizontal Evil, and the others a crime?\n\nAlthough Han Sen doubted the credibility of the scroll, he continued pulling the scroll open. He wanted to see what was at the end.\n\nEventually, when he pulled it to some level, the drawing's power was too strong. He was not able to keep pulling the scroll open anymore.\n\n\"Open!\" Han Sen groaned. Sky Star Wolf's glyph flashed on his body, giving him a bit more power. He kept pulling the scroll open.\n\nHan Sen's arms had veins sticking out. Many substance chains flashed across his hands. He was forcing the scroll open bit by bit.\n\n\"Han Yufei... Blasphemy to god... got hit into a loophole never to be reborn...\" Han Sen finally saw a crime with a different title. That made him wonder even more.\n\nHan Sen's head was full of questions. Han Yufei? That should be a woman's name. But who is she? What does it have to do with Sacred? How does she have the crime of being blasphemous to a god? That cannot be as bad as killing a god. But why are Purple Fight's crime and the others involve just killing, and this woman was hit into a loophole to never be reborn?\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen's power was no longer able to hold against the strength of the scroll. The scroll's two sticks bounced back into their original position, rerolling the paper to how it was. The scroll then tried to fly away.\n\nHan Sen held onto the scroll and suppressed it enough to stick it in Destiny's Tower.\n\nWhat is going on here? Why have so many people managed to kill a god before? Han Sen was very suspicious, but he did not have enough information. He could not make a reasonable judgment just yet.\n\nIt looks like I will have to wait until my power is stronger. At that time, I can completely open the scroll and learn the meaning of the names in the scroll. Han Sen put the issue of the scroll aside.\n\nHe was now an adult. Although no one would have been able to tell he was Han Sen, it was not suitable for him to remain with the Extreme King anymore. So, Han Sen teleported back to the sanctuaries.\n\nHan Ling'er was learning how to draw in the garden when she saw Han Sen suddenly appear. She tilted her head to the side, looked at him, and asked, \"Are you a thief?\"\n\n\"If I was a thief, what would you do to me?\" Han Sen smiled and looked at Han Ling'er. He wanted to prank her.\n\nHan Ling'er blinked and said, \"Mister Handsome Thief, you look very hot. If you leave now, I will pretend she never saw you.\"\n\nHan Sen's head was full of dark clouds. Ling'er is so small, and she is already obsessed with appearances. I should teach her that good-looking men are not trustable.\"\n\n\"Ling'er, do you not recognize Dad?\" Han Sen asked. He looked gloomy.\n\n\"Dad?\" Han Ling'er looked at Han Sen with confusion. A while later, she tilted her head and was gladly thrust into Han Sen's hands. She asked, \"Dad? Since when did you become so handsome?\"\n\nHan Sen wished to say something more, but he heard Ji Yanran approaching. She looked at Han Sen for a while. With surprise, she said, \"Han Sen, why do you look better now?\"\n\nHan Sen explained what had happened to him. Ji Yanran and Ling'er were next to Han Sen. He had one in each arm. They were next to him listening to him explain what had happened.\n\nHan Sen quickly noticed that his reputation in the house had been greatly increased. Before, when he arrived home, he would just eat normal food. Now, Ji Yanran made some extra good dishes.\n\nLing'er kept going around Han Sen for hugs. She didn't stop. She kept calling out for daddy and asking for kisses.\n\nThis mother and daughter... Han Sen noticed that to increase his reputation in their family, power and such were useless. Good looks were the most effective weapons.\n\n\"My original face was not that bad.\" Han Sen felt sad. His face had not been a super handsome one, but his body shape and presence was always there. He could not have been any worse than a supermodel. His treatment, however, was terrible.\n\nThe next morning, after resting for a day, Han Sen was woken up by Ji Yanran screaming.\n\n\"What is it? It is very early in the morning.\" Han Sen sat up and discovered that something was wrong. He looked closer. His body had turned into the body of a child again. Even Han Sen was shocked.\n\n\"What happened? Why do I look like this again? I thought after reaching larva class that I would be normal.\" Han Sen developed a cold sweat.\n\n\"So adorable...\" Ji Yanran hugged Han Sen in her arms. She used her cheeks to rub against Han Sen's cheeks and said, \"Littleflower was this cute when he was this small.\"\n\nHan Sen did not know what to say. Ji Yanran was very accepting of the fact that her husband had turned into a child. She was not worried.\n\nHan Sen researched this for a while. He found out he could not stay an adult for a long amount of time. Every once in awhile, he was able to turn into an adult, but he would not be an adult for a long time. He was only able to be an adult for around 10 hours. After that, he turned back into a child.\n\nI went through all this trouble, and I am still not recovered! It looks like I will have to become butterfly class to totally recover. Han Sen was thinking about how to escape the Extreme King, but it turned out that there was no need for now. He decided to remain Holy Baby in the Extreme King and take advantage of their resources.\n\nWhile he was still an adult, Han Sen harnessed his power to use the Four Sheep Cube and enter God's Farm. He wanted to see if he could find Wan'er again.\n\nHan Sen had just entered God's Farm when he saw Wan'er killing sheep with her knife. This delighted him.\n\nI researched how to deal with God's Knife for a long time. Now, I can put my exercise into practice. Han Sen teleported in front of Wan'er. He looked at Wan'er, who was holding God's Knife and slurping up blood, and said, \"Wan'er, back off!\""
