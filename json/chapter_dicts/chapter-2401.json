    "text": "Han Sen had long been curious about Destiny\u2019s Tower, and that was because this stone Destiny\u2019s Tower was just like the metal Destiny\u2019s Tower inside his Sea of Soul. Aside from the towers being made of different materials\u2014one having been made of stone and other having been made of metal\u2014there was no difference.\n\nFour deified elites used their powers to force open the gate to Destiny\u2019s Tower. Only one person could go in while the gate was being held up. Once he received the signal, Han Sen immediately ran into the tower.\n\nDeng!\n\nHan Sen had just entered the tower when the door slammed shut behind him.\n\nBecause Han Sen knew the process, though, he wasn\u2019t afraid.\n\nThe four deified elites had to use formation powers just to get the door open, and it could only be kept open for a single second. It simply wasn\u2019t feasible to keep it open any longer than that.\n\nHan Sen was given one month to spend in Destiny\u2019s Tower. When that month was up, the door would open again, and Han Sen would be allowed to leave.\n\nHan Sen looked around the tower. He had heard there was supposed to be an amazing geno art located inside the tower, and any creature that learned it would be able to increase the speed of their evolution. But everyone who left the tower seemed to practice different geno arts. That made Han Sen curious about whether the rumor was true.\n\nHan Sen was on the first floor of Destiny\u2019s Tower. The layout was exactly like his own Destiny\u2019s Tower, but there were some paintings hanging on the walls of this tower.\n\nThe pictures were supposedly the geno arts of legend, but when Han Sen looked closer, he realized that the pictures were not geno arts at all. They were drawings of people.\n\nThe pictures were of a man. Han Sen couldn\u2019t tell if he was human, crystallizer, Extreme King, or one of the Sky. They all looked so similar that it was hard to tell the precise race of the man in the painting.\n\nBut this man wasn\u2019t drawn like an average person. He was drawn like a god atop an altar. Every wall held a picture depicting the same man in a different position, but no matter how he was posed, he seemed to be looking out of the picture with disdain. It was somehow uncomfortable to meet the painted man\u2019s gaze.\n\nAlthough Han Sen knew it was just a drawing, not a living man, the painted man gave him a chilled feeling. It was like the eyes of the man could see right through his soul or something.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He longer he looked at the painting, the more he wanted to avoid it. That wasn\u2019t normal.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong with this drawing? Or is it like a jade spirit in the White Jade Jing? Is it actually alive?\u201d Han Sen looked at the man in the painting, but try as he might, he couldn\u2019t discern its true nature.\n\nHe looked across the whole first floor, but he found nothing except for pictures of that one man. Han Sen silently moved on to the second floor.\n\nUpon reaching the second floor, Han Sen frowned. This floor had paintings of the man on every wall as well. He was just posed in different positions than he had been on the first floor.\n\n\u201cThis entire tower isn\u2019t just full of this one man\u2019s paintings, is it?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped, and so he proceeded to the third floor.\n\nOf course, Han Sen was unlucky. His guess had been correct. The third floor held the same paintings.\n\nEach floor in the tower had eight walls. Each wall had a painting of its own. Han Sen walked all the way from the first floor to the sixth floor, and he saw forty-eight of the man\u2019s paintings in total.\n\nIt was the same person in every painting. He was just in a different position in each one. He would be sitting in one, while in another, he could be standing or lying down. All the pictures had the man in a different position. But no matter what his position was, the man\u2019s eyes were always the same. Han Sen hated those eyes.\n\nThe man wasn\u2019t ugly. In fact, Han Sen thought he was quite handsome. The man had a smile that should have been loveable, but instead, Han Sen loathed it. He couldn\u2019t put his finger on why.\n\nHan Sen was a little surprised by that realization, because he didn\u2019t like judging people by their appearance. It didn\u2019t matter if a person looked nice or horrible; he would not form a real opinion on them until he learned more about who they really were.\n\nBut now, looking at these paintings, Han Sen already hated this man. That was not normal at all.\n\nTrying to suppress his hatred, Han Sen climbed to the highest floor. This was the seventh floor.\n\nIf the stone Destiny\u2019s Tower was related to his metal Destiny\u2019s Tower, the seventh floor should have a space Bai Sema. That was where Han Sen imprisoned people in his own tower.\n\nAs soon as Han Sen stepped onto the seventh floor of Destiny\u2019s Tower, he stopped dead in his tracks.\n\nThere were no more of those paintings on the seventh floor. There was just a stone platform in the middle of the room. Someone was sitting atop the stone platform, and Han Sen realized instantly that it was the same man showcased in the forty-eight paintings across the lower floors.\n\nHe sat atop the stone platform, his legs crossed like a buddha. His hands were down, and his eyes were shut. It was like he was sleeping.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t detect a lifeforce coming from the man, though. The man was like a statue. With Han Sen\u2019s eyesight, though, he could tell the man actually was alive. He could see the man\u2019s pores and the pink of his skin.\n\nHan Sen could see most of his vessels, too. Aside from the fact that he wasn\u2019t breathing, he really did look like someone who was alive.\n\nHan Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to inspect the man. It was odd that the man looked so alive while giving off utterly no indication of lifeforce. Even after scanning the man, Han Sen couldn\u2019t tell if he was living or dead. That was extremely weird.\n\nWhile Han Sen was examining the man, some sort of odd wave began to pass through the air around the man\u2019s body. The air moved in a circle, like a nearly invisible whirlpool.\n\nHan Sen took a step back. He soon realized that the swirl was just a lifeforce, not anything harmful.\n\nWhat astonished Han Sen the most, though, was that the black crystal armor in his Sea of Soul reacted to the whirlpool. The armor began to tremble. A mysterious power flowed out of the armor and sank into Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen felt himself become really heavy. It was like the cells inside his body had been frozen in place by that mysterious power. The Dongxuan Sutra and Han Sen\u2019s other primary geno arts had been locked down by the strange power as well.\n\nOnly the Original Water King Body and a few other powers Han Sen had absorbed were still active inside his body.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen asked in sudden trepidation. Then the man slowly opened his eyes. It looked like he was smiling at Han Sen, but he wasn\u2019t.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart flared with that feeling of hatred again, but this time, it was one thousand times stronger than it had been when he saw those pictures. Han Sen managed to suppress the feelings and keep them from showing on his face.\n\nHan Sen finally figured out where the feelings were coming from, though. The passionate hatred inside him was flowing out of the black crystal armor. It wasn\u2019t his own emotion.\n\nThe man stared at Han Sen the same way he\u2019d gazed out of the paintings. He smiled and coldly asked, \u201cDo you believe that this world has a God?\u201d"
