He knew he couldn\u2019t stop what was happening, but he hoped he could pick up a few goodies at the very least. Perhaps he\u2019d even be able to kill a few of the super creatures and take their Life Geno Essences from Sky King.\n\nThe Sky Tree was growing at an alarming rate. The red and black bark was cracking and beginning to peel. Countless creatures tried to scramble out of the cracks that webbed the tree.\n\nAs the tree grew and grew, the creatures started to return to their original size. There were tigers, titans, and birds; every creature imaginable, all trying to make an escape.\n\nBut when they made it out, their bodies began to tear apart. Vines shot out from beneath their skin, ravaging their flesh and tangling them up. This happened to those that were airborne as well, and they rained down to the ground in pieces.\n\nThe roots of the tree then began to lift themselves up and escape the ground that kept them in place. Like hungry tentacles, the roots grabbed the corpses of fallen creatures and drained them of their lifeforce.\n\nThe cracks across the tree began to heal, crushing creatures that sought to escape from them. The tree was slowly being drenched in blood, making for a terrible sight.\n\nA lot of creatures were unable to exit in time. For those that weren\u2019t crushed by the devilish lumber, they were instead ripped apart by the phantom vines that had been slumbering inside their bodies.\n\nThe place was like a forested depiction of hell, and just as Han Sen thought it would be best if he left, a light appeared. The light was Qing Jun. Her lifeforce was draining, as green sprouts began to pop up over her body.\n\n\u201cGet the Cruel Bottle!\u201d Qing Jun was not doing well, evidently. As she approached Han Sen, she did so with wobbling movements. She was in great pain and suffering, that much was clear.\n\n\u201cWhy? What is it?\u201d Han Sen asked, but he did not delay in retrieving the jade bottle she had recently given him.\n\nQing Jun gritted her teeth and knelt in front of Han Sen. She placed her right hand on her chest and said, \u201cI, Qing Jun, am willing to submit and offer absolute loyalty to a new master. I will become a faithful servant from now until eternity.\u201d\n\nAfter that, her forehead gleamed with a spirit stone. Needless to say, Han Sen was in shock that Qing Jun, of all spirits, was willing to obey him. Han Sen held her spirit stone in his hand. It shone brightly before becoming one with Qing Jun again.\n\nQing Jun might have become Han Sen\u2019s spirit, but the green sprouts were still on her.\n\n\u201cOpen the bottle and let me in!\u201d Qing Jun shouted.\n\n\u201cHow do I open it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHe had tried to open the Cruel Bottle before, but he was unable to. He thought it was very strange of her to give him a bottle, but at least now it was starting to make sense.\n\nHan Sen touched the bottle to try to open it again, but this time, it opened immediately. Han Sen realized he could only use it once a contract with the spirit that gave it had been signed.\n\nAfter the bottle was opened, Qing Jun transformed into a pellet of bright light. Then, she tucked herself inside it. As Han Sen wondered why Qing Jun was doing this, another light appeared. This time, it was Water Fairy.\n\nWater Fairy\u2019s body was transparent, and you could see the sprouts manifesting inside her watery body. Her body bubbled and boiled, and if this was to continue, it\u2019d only be a matter of time before she evaporated out of existence.\n\nShe shouted, \u201cHelp!\u201d\n\nThen she raced into the bottle alongside Qing Jun. Han Sen peered at Qing Jun and the Water Fairy inside the bottle, side by side, and noticed now that the sprouts had stopped growing on and within them. They were all gone.\n\nHan Sen was delighted, learning this treasure he had been given could negate the dark powers of the Sky Tree.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, help!\u201d Han Sen heard someone call out his name.\n\nHe turned to see a number of vines crawling through the air like a webbed net. A second later, they were cut down to the ground. A mound of bones had given them a shave, and when Han Sen\u2019s eyes came to focus, he saw Dry Bone King doing battle.\n\nHan Sen flew over towards him, bottle in hand. As he pointed it at Dry Bone King, he asked, \u201cCan you come inside?\u201d\n\nDry Bone King spared no time in diving into the purifying comfort of the Cruel Bottle. Then, looking up, Han Sen saw a nine-headed creature soar through the sky, screeching in pain. It was headed straight for him.\n\nBut before Han Sen could do anything for it, the heads began to separate from its body as vines ravaged the poor beast. Its lifeforce was all going to the tree.\n\nWhen the body hit the ground, roots sprang out of the earth and dragged it underground.\n\nHan Sen felt it was a great shame and waste. Turning around again, though, Han Sen saw Ghost Eye becoming consumed by the hungry, lecherous vines. He was going to pull out his Phoenix Sword and do what he could to help. But before Han Sen could do anything, Ghost Eye saw the bottle and dived right into it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to get easy kills! Why am I inadvertently saving these things?\u201d Han Sen thought, but then he noticed something. It didn\u2019t seem like anything could exit the bottle without his explicit permission.\n\nThe sound of an explosion rang through the forest. A rock giant was headed Han Sen\u2019s way, covered in vines like angry moss. The sturdy golem was able to defy their attempts to tear it apart, though.\n\nAnd as expected, before the vines could do what they wished to, the rock giant jumped inside the Cruel Bottle."
