    "text": "Black-Moon King nodded slightly, then shook his head. The nobles around were confused, and they weren\u2019t sure what that meant. No one was going to ask now, though. They were happy to wait until Black-Moon King finished his investigation. They were still very curious about the knife.\n\nBlack-Moon King inspected the blade from top-to-bottom, at least ten times. He eventually gave out a long sigh, and with an ashamed tone of voice, said, \u201cIt is a shame\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack-Moon King, tell us clearly! What about it is a shame?\u201d Night River King couldn\u2019t help but ask.\n\nBlack-Moon King held the Knife Blank and said, \u201cPlanet Knife Grave is more like a museum for knives. No one knows where the knives come from, but they are relics from a long-ago eon. They weren\u2019t forged, and the grave is just a container. Their numbers don\u2019t change. So, when you take one out, there is one less there. New ones aren\u2019t generated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that! But what does that mean?\u201d Night River King looked annoyed.\n\nAs Black-Moon King continued looking at the Knife Blank, he sighed and said, \u201cThis Knife Blank is an anomaly. I am not sure why such material exists there, in the grave. The surface of the planet has been soaking in knifeminds and knifeairs for so long, this Knife Blank was generated. Give it a bit more time, perhaps a few thousand years, and it might become a real knife. And on top of that, a King class weapon. It is a shame it was brought out so early. It is just a Knife Blank. Now that it has left the grave, there is no more knifeair or knifeminds to cultivate it. I am afraid this Knife Blank might be ruined forever.\u201d\n\nHearing him say all this, Night River King asked, \u201cNo one can finish it, perhaps through forging?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be hard. Aside from Planet Knife Grave, where could you find a place with knifeair? And the knives that come from inside there, they cannot be returned once they have left. I am afraid it won\u2019t become a true knife.\u201d After Black-Moon King said that, he returned the knife to Han Sen. \u201cAlthough it is just a Knife Blank, and it doesn\u2019t have its own knifeair and knifemind, it\u2019s still as sturdy as a King class weapon. It counts as King class, fret not.\u201d\n\nMany Nobles and Kings were very jealous, hearing this. Although it wasn\u2019t fully a King class weapon, it had the makings of one. Han Sen had also received another King class knife, as well: Ghost Teeth. He was the one who had emerged with the most rewards, following the trip inside. Despite their jealousy, the onlookers knew they couldn\u2019t say anything. It would be impossible to try to steal the items, too. Han Sen was Knife Queen\u2019s student.\n\n\u201cEveryone, take your knives and get them recorded. Then we can return,\u201d Black-Moon King addressed Han Sen and the other Barons.\n\n\u201cMy King, we do not know what the Knife Blank\u2019s name is. How might we record it?\u201d A recorder asked Black-Moon King.\n\nBlack-Moon King looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cSee if you can activate its power. Although it is only a Knife Blank, it might still have a mind of its own.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and tried to insert his power into it.\n\nIt was different from how it occurred with Ghost Teeth. When Han Sen used that malicious blade, he only needed a little bit of power to activate it. But this Knife Blank was like a black hole. When Han Sen put power into it, nothing happened. Nothing even moved.\n\nThe Knife Blank was like a block of steel, and nothing transpired.\n\nHan Sen expected this, though. After all, the Knife Blank did not have a reaction to his knifemind. Han Sen had a strong knifemind, but his actual strength was far weaker. It would be strange if Han Sen could activate it through his current level of strength.\n\nSeeing the Knife Blank give no reaction, the others couldn\u2019t keep themselves from mocking the effort.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it has no life, after all. It\u2019s just a rod of steel!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis world is not as good as you might like to believe. There is no way you could have received a second King class weapon. After your first, don\u2019t expect anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has no life, but it is hard. You could still use it to practice!\u201d\n\nHan Sen deactivated his powers. As he held the Knife Blank, he shook his head.\n\nBlack-Moon King thought for a moment, then said, \u201cIf you agree to it, I myself can try and activate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d Han Sen passed it to Black-Moon King.\n\nBlack-Moon King took the Knife Blank and inserted his power into it. Black-Moon King was a very powerful person, but not even he could an incite a reaction in it.\n\nAfter that, Black-Moon King shook his head and gave it back to Han Sen. \u201cIt looks like the Knife Blank does not have a mind. It is a shame.\u201d\n\nBlack-Moon King turned around and said to the recorder, \u201cWrite down \u2018Knife Blank,\u2019 then.\u201d\n\nAfter the registration was complete, Han Sen said goodbye to Black Steel. He brought Ghost Teeth and Knife Blank with him back to Planet Knife. He was going to meet up with Yisha.\n\n\u201cShow me your Ghost Teeth knife,\u201d Yisha said, nodding to the knife that was in his satchel.\n\nHan Sen brought the Ghost Teeth knife out in front of Yisha. Yisha took it and put her power into it, and then, she frowned.\n\nWhen Han Sen put his power in, it had incited a reaction with his knifemind. She had casually done the same, too, and while she was stronger than Han Sen, there was no reaction.\n\nYisha frowned. She tried putting a lot of power into it, and eventually, Ghost Teeth started to rattle. It released a purple smoke before trying to escape from her hands and return to Han Sen.\n\nYisha was shocked. Ghost Teeth knife only managed to escape while she was distracted, but that was not the point\n\nThe point was, her Teeth Knife matched with the Ghost Teeth knife. It should have felt her power and accepted her strength, but it resisted her and flew back to Han Sen. That was shocking.\n\nYisha did not know Han Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife knifemind was stronger. The reason it selected Han Sen was because of his deified knifemind. She was half a step behind him, so the blade did not choose her.\n\nYisha didn\u2019t try taking it again. She stared at Han Sen for a while, and eventually said, \u201cYou did well. Put the knife away for now. A rule of the Rebate says that if you have a King class weapon, you can own a planet in the Narrow Moons. Get ready.\u201d"
