    "text": "\"How long have you spent in God's Sanctuary?\" Yi Dongmu asked Han Sen.\n\n\"Not long, just a few days.\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"Have you heard about Dollar recently?\" Yi Dongmu had spent about six months in the God's Sanctuary this time. He had been hunting alone all the time and did not have any news from the outside.\n\nHan Sen was dazed, as he did not expect that was what Yi Dongmu would ask. He thought about it and said, \"I heard that there was someone named Kill Dollar on the official platform. He had won consecutively. Some people said he was Dollar himself, and I wondered if that was true.\"\n\n\"Tell me about the details,\" Yi Dongmu said immediately.\n\nHaving taken the mutant meat, Han Sen explained briefly to Yi Dongmu, and added in the end deliberately, \"I have only heard about it. No one knows whether Kill Dollar's actual Dollar. And I will be the last one to tell.\"\n\n\"It must be him. Except for him, no one could be that good,\" Yi Dongmu said assertively.\n\nHan Sen was embarrassed inwardly. There were definitely evolvers who could be as good. He just had not met a truly good opponent.\n\n\"I want to hunt a sacred-blood creature and need an assistant. Come with me, I will spare you 10% of the meat after I succeed,\" Yi Dongmu said to Han Sen after eating a smaller half of the barbecue and taking the rest into his pocket.\n\n\"20%,\" Han Sen blinked and doubled the price.\n\n\"Let's go.\" Yi Dongmu did not bargain and asked Han Sen to go with him.\n\nHan Sen like people like this a lot. Rich people who did not care about the price and only cared to be happy are the best.\n\nFollowing Yi Dongmu eastward on the icefield, Han Sen reached the snowcapped mountains in less than two days. If he were to go back to Goddess shelter, he must cross this region.\n\nHowever, because of the terrain, it was not easy to pass this region. Furthermore, if he encountered sacred-blood creatures, it was too dangerous to fight on the mountains without the ability to fly. If he were not careful, he would fall into deep valleys.\n\nThe reason that Li Xinglun and Blackgod would try to conquer the royal shelter before they expand to the mountainous region was because of the terrain, which was unsuitable for large-scale fights.\n\n\"You are not trying to enter the mountains to hunt sacred-blood creatures?\" Han Sen asked Yi Dongmu, surprised.\n\n\"Relax, there is no risks. I'm only asking you to lure the creature out for me. The rest is my job. That creature had suffered in my hands, so it would not there to come out if I were there,\" Yi Dongmu said quietly.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything more and followed Yi Dongmu into the snowcapped mountains. Like Yi Dongmu said, he did not go deep into the mountains, but stopped after climbing one mountain.\n\n\"Just walk around ahead of me. When the creature had come out, run in my direction.\" Yi Dongmu dug a hole in the snow and lay down, asking Han Sen to bury him with the snow.\n\nHan Sen knew that like himself, Yi Dongmu was also an assassin. He did not say much and followed Yi Dongmu's instruction, walking around in the valley ahead of him.\n\nLooking around, all he could see was continuous snowcapped mountains. There were no creatures, let alone sacred-blood creatures.\n\n\"What creatures would be here?\" Han Sen looked for a while and did not spot any creatures.\n\nAs Han Sen became impatient, he suddenly heard hoofbeat. From afar, he saw a donkey-like creature with a pair of antlers running from behind a mountain.\n\nIts hooves were rather wide, which prevented it from being trapped in the snow. It ran toward Han Sen quickly, faster and faster.\n\n\"There is a creature indeed!\" Han Sen did not know whether this one was the one that Yi Dongmu was talking about. He turned around to run toward were Yi Dongmu was hiding.\n\nThe creature looked like it could fly, running fast on the snow. Luckily, Han Sen was close to where Yi Dongmu was hiding and soon reached him.\n\nThe creature followed Han Sen and approached him quickly. Yi Dongmu quickly emerged from underneath the snow, appearing under the stomach of the creature, stabbing his dagger into its stomach, making a long cut.\n\nThe creature was bleeding on its stomach. Forgetting about Han Sen, it neighed, turned around and ran.\n\nHowever, Yi Dongmu would never let it go. Catching up with it, he cut the creature repeatedly. The creature finally fell on the floor quietly.\n\n\"Good skills, good footwork.\" Han Sen couldn't help complimenting. Yi Dongmu had made great progress in these years indeed. In addition, he was in Second God's Sanctuary several years earlier, so he had improved his geno points greatly.\n\n\"If it were Dollar, he would have killed the creature with the first strike. I am not good enough.\" Yi Dongmu said seriously.\n\nHan Sen felt very embarrassed inwardly. Yi Dongmu was simply obsessed.\n\nIt should have been several years since Yi Dongmu saw him. So, there was no way Yi Dongmu knew what level Han Sen was on. It was completely his own illusion.\n\n\"Is that the sacred-blood creature that you were talking about?\" Han Sen walked up to the creature and asked, puzzled.\n\nAlthough this creature ran fast, it did not look like a sacred-blood creature judging from its fitness.\n\nYi Dongmu shook his head. \"Not this one. This is a mutant creature.\"\n\nYi Dongmu then paused and said, \"This is good as well. We will use this body as the bait. That creature would come out smelling the blood. You can stay here and make a barbecue out of this mutant creature.\"\n\nYi Dongmu then dug another hole and hid himself again.\n\n\"Brother, you do not need to work so hard. How about we continue after eating something together?\" Asked Han Sen.\n\n\"No need. If it were Dollar, he would have done even better.\" Yi Dongmu said seriously and urged Han Sen to bury him up.\n\nHan Sen did not know what to say. Even he felt somewhat embarrassed. He did not feel he was as good as Yi Dongmu had described.\n\nHan Sen buried Yi Dongmu up again. Dissecting the mutant creature's body, Han Sen thought it was a bit too big for him to eat. He then summoned Meowth to offer him the food.\n\nMeowth bit the body of the mutant creature excitedly. As for Archangel, she did not care to eat mutant meat at all, not wanting to come out.\n\nHan Sen took out a piece of barbecued snake fish king, eating while squatting. He soon heard the voice telling him the increase of sacred geno points.\n\nSeeing that Han Sen was feeding mutant meat to his pet, Yi Dongmu frowned slightly. This behavior was a bit too extravagant. Even Yi Dongmu himself had never done that before.\n\nAfter all, the resources on this icefield were so limited that Yi Dongmu had not even filled up his mutant geno points yet.\n\nAfter Han Sen had just taken a few bites, he heard loud hoofbeat behind the mountain again."
