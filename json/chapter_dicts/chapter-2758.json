    "text": "\u201cStay away! This is the battleground of men. This is nothing for you to be involved in,\u201d Han Sen said over his shoulder, keeping his eyes on the red demon.\n\nAfter Han Sen combined his four geno arts, the Dongxuan Area\u2019s power increased exponentially. Han Sen discovered that this God\u2019s Knife wasn\u2019t really a knife. It was a xenogeneic. Although it was a living creature, its body and soul were like knives.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know the level of this xenogeneic, but its power was already beyond what Han Sen could accurately gauge.\n\nThe blood demon\u2019s shadow stared at Han Sen coldly. The sharp knife in its hands glowed with a bloody light. The space around the knife was twisted by that bloody light, hiding the body of the knife. The only thing still visible through the twisted space was the knife light held by the glowing shadow of a hand.\n\nThe next second, the shadow moved. It traveled like a red mist beneath the sun. It was coming for Han Sen.\n\nThe power in Han Sen\u2019s body exploded. He teleported behind the shadow and sent a punch toward the blood demon.\n\nBut the blood demon looked as if it didn\u2019t know that Han Sen had already teleported away. Its knife was still headed for Han Sen\u2019s previous location.\n\nHan Sen was surprised that his opponent had been thrown off course by such a simple trick, but he continued with his strike. For him, this was a good opportunity. He couldn\u2019t just stop mid-attack because of his suspicion.\n\nKatcha!\n\nBut before Han Sen\u2019s fist hit the blood demon, his chest was cut open. A few of his ribs were sliced clean through, and some of his organs and crystallized blood were showing.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on\u2026? Why did I get hit?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face contorted in sudden pain. He didn\u2019t understand how the creature had managed to hit him.\n\nThe blood shadow hadn\u2019t turned around or even swung its knife toward Han Sen, but he had still been injured. This was so weird.\n\nThere was no time to think. He summoned his Immortal Dragon, and it immediately released an immortal substance chain toward Han Sen\u2019s chest that healed Han Sen\u2019s wounds quickly.\n\nThe blood demon moved forward and swung its knife at Han Sen in a crazed fury.\n\nHan Sen understood that his xenogeneic power was extremely inferior to that of the blood demon. He wanted to know how he had been hit, as well, so instead of attempting to block the attack, he used teleport again. But this time, he didn\u2019t teleport closer to the blood demon. He teleported away, trying to put some distance between his enemy and himself.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThere was a space of 100 miles separating Han Sen and the blood demon, and the knife light wasn\u2019t slashing toward Han Sen. But even so, an invisible blade split Han Sen\u2019s head open. His skull cracked down the center, opening wide enough to show his pink brain. The pain of the attack was excruciating, and Han Sen\u2019s face turned white.\n\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Although the attack had been brutal, Han Sen had learned something. He now understood how he had been hit.\n\nThe bloody knife light had traveled to where Han Sen had previously been standing. There, a very dim blood shadow had appeared. That blood shadow resembled Han Sen\u2019s face. The bloody knife light slashed that blood shadow, and Han Sen\u2019s body was injured by the blow.\n\n\u201cIs it a time or space power? Or is it a bit of both?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s wounds were healed by the Immortal Dragon\u2019s power. Not even such a grievous injury was going to kill him now.\n\nBut the blood demon was clearly a scarier opponent than he had expected. Han Sen had already used Forever Solid on himself. Under the buffs of Forever Solid, even transmutation deifieds couldn\u2019t damage his xenogeneic battle body.\n\nPlus, the pesky dragon scales growing on his skin gave him an immunity power. He was indestructible.\n\nThe bloody knife light wasn\u2019t physically striking his body, but it could still cut through his armor, scales, and bones. This was very frightening.\n\nThe blood demon didn\u2019t seem to be putting as much thought into the situation as Han Sen was. Its face looked murderous as it came for him without hesitation. Wherever the knife light went, the space nearby was badly distorted. It was like many twisting blood lights were dancing around the knife light.\n\nThis time, Han Sen didn\u2019t try to teleport. Instead, he summoned his Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. He was going to block the blood demon\u2019s knife.\n\nThe blood demon\u2019s power was strange, and trying to dodge it seemed to be useless. Han Sen had to block it.\n\nBut the next second, Han Sen\u2019s chest was spilling blood. His entire body flew away. He hurtled through the air for a few miles, then his body slammed into the field like an asteroid.\n\nHan Sen regained his senses in a giant, circular hole. The armor on his chest had been cut open, revealing the flesh inside. His scales, bones, and ribs were cut in half.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s shield was still fine. Although the shield could stop all sorts of physical attacks, it was apparently unable to inhibit the knife light.\n\nThat weird knife light phased through the shield like a ghost and struck Han Sen in the chest, completely unimpeded.\n\nThe blood demon\u2019s body flashed, and it kept up an endless stream of attacks. No matter how Han Sen dodged or blocked, he couldn\u2019t manage to stop the blood demon\u2019s knife light. Every slash hit him, and Han Sen\u2019s god body bled as he incurred more and more knife-borne injuries.\n\nIf not for the Immortal Dragon madly healing him as he fought, Han Sen would probably have been sliced to pieces a long time ago.\n\nEven so, there was a limit to how fast the Immortal Dragon could heal him. Its healing ability was beginning to lag behind the injuries Han Sen was receiving. Before Han Sen\u2019s wounds healed completely, he was hit a few more times.\n\n\u201cPowerful. Incredibly powerful. It is so powerful that fighting it makes one feel rather hopeless.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust run! You\u2019re going to get killed!\u201d Gu Wan\u2019er shouted from her position near the carriage. Countless shockwaves were being unleashed from Han Sen and the blood demon\u2019s fight, but the carriage wasn\u2019t taking any damage. It looked as if some magical power was protecting the vehicle in some capacity. Whenever a shockwave reached the carriage, it would fade.\n\nHan Sen wanted to run away, too, but he couldn\u2019t. Even teleporting away was futile. He would still end up injured by the demon. And some sort of cruel, restrictive power was locking this planet down. Entering was easy, but leaving would require Han Sen to somehow break through the bai sema. Not even his teleportation skills were enough.\n\nThe knife\u2019s power was so weird. No matter what Han Sen did, he would end up being hit.\n\nThe only good thing about this situation was that the blood demon\u2019s power couldn\u2019t kill him in a single blow. If it had been any stronger, he would have died before he even had a chance to fight back.\n\nKatcha!\n\nA slash struck Han Sen\u2019s body again. Han Sen couldn\u2019t even see how he had been injured. The blow almost severed his arm at the shoulder.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s body started to glow with blood light. Black scales grew like crazy, forcing their way through his armor. In seconds, the scales had wrapped all the way around Han Sen\u2019s body and through his armor.\n\nBefore Han Sen figured out what was going on, he felt the ground shake. A blood light had shot down from space, and now it was gleaming in front of Han Sen. It was the blood coral that looked like a blood dragon."
