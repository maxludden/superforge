I will\u2026 I will\u2026\u201d Guna was young, and so her body had already started to shake.\n\nHan Sen stroked her cheek, and he found it to be remarkably soft and smooth. Then, he pulled his fingers back and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I am not interested in creatures that are unable to stretch their legs. I can\u2019t let other people see you, that\u2019s all. So, for now, things will have to remain like so. When we\u2019re in Narrow Moon, you can sleep wherever you wish to.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen closed his eyes and got some sleep. Eventually, upon realizing Han Sen really was there to rest,\n\nGuna finally felt relief. But that night, Guna found herself unable to get a wink of sleep. She lay awake, thinking about all sorts of things.\n\nEverything had happened so quickly. She had been kidnapped by Han Sen, while the rest of her family and race were made items for auction. Thinking about her family and her own fate being in the hands of others, Guna started to cry.\n\nThe next morning, Han Sen woke up and saw Guna looking at him with incredibly red eyes. He frowned and said, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was hoping Guna could be a fine worker for him on Planet Eclipse. He didn\u2019t want to kick things off with a sour relationship.\n\n\u201cDo you really want to recruit me as a member?\u201d Guna\u2019s eyes could not stop blinking. It looked as if she wanted to see right through Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat else would I need you for? I am not interested in xenogeneics.\u201d Han Sen got up, ignoring Guna\u2019s red eyes as he spoke.\n\n\u201cAre you going to the auction?\u201d Guna asked.\n\nYes.\u201d Han Sen did not have to hide anything.\n\nGuna gritted her teeth and said, \u201cLet\u2019s trade! If you help me get a Gana, I will obey you without question. I will diligently work for you in Narrow Moon.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a fair enough deal, but I don\u2019t have the funds. I am only going there for show. I don\u2019t plan on buying anything. You know the Gana are really expensive, don\u2019t you? The auction will be nuts. People will be throwing tall stacks of money around.\u201d Han Sen slumped his shoulders.\n\n\u201cI have a way.\u201d Guna spoke only after receding into thought for a while.\n\nHan Sen looked at Guna and told her, \u201cTell me, then. If things aren\u2019t too complicated, I might be able to take you up on the offer.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nIcebird Duke and Han Sen went to the auction. It was set in a beautiful palace, which was where the Gana had gone to pray. Now, it had become an auction house to sell Gana.\n\nSeeing the Gana statue, Han Sen sighed and thought to himself, \u201cIt looks like praying to God is useless. The lord helps those who help themselves, I guess.\u201d\n\nThere were many elites attending the auction, and they were all sitting down at tables. None of them looked weak. \u201cGreetings, from Icebird and Han Sen.\u201d Icebird Duke took Han Sen to meet Gold Jade King.\n\nGold Jade King was a handsome fellow, and his rabbit fur was all gold. He looked very Noble, almost like a holy deity.\n\nOn top of that, Han Sen also thought he looked very familiar. Now that he thought about it, the Earl Rebate he had beaten in the Moon God Festival looked remarkably similar.\n\n\u201cYou are Knife Queen\u2019s student?\u201d Gold Jade King\u2019s golden eyes looked at him.\n\nYes. It\u2019s good to meet you, sir,\u201d Han Sen said politely. He didn\u2019t want to offend Gold Jade King. If he really wanted to buy the Gana, he needed Gold Jade King\u2019s power to do that and still make it back to Narrow Moon.\n\nHan Sen and Icebird Duke\u2019s combined power was fairly weak. Even if they secured a Gana, they could easily be mugged.\n\nGold Jade King nodded and said, \u201cFind a seat and sit down.\u201d\n\nYes.\u201d Han Sen and Icebird Duke answered at the same time, and then they found a table with available seats.\n\nThere was a space next to Gold Jade King\u2019s table, but he did not invite them to sit with him. As a result, they did not.\n\nHan Sen dipped his finger in a glass of water and used it to write on the table. \u201cIcebird Duke, that gold-eared Earl in the Moon Festival\u2026 Are they related?\u201d\n\nIcebird Duke saw it, and also wrote on the table. \u201cGao Ji is Gold Jade King\u2019s seventeenth son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good. If something happens to us here, do you think he\u2019ll help us?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed, hearing this.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say. Gold Jade King might have many children, but he does love Gao Ji above the rest. After you defeated Gao Ji like you did, well, it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s upset about it. It is best, all things considered, that you don\u2019t start trouble here.\u201d Icebird Duke finished writing.\n\nHan Sen sighed, and he thought to himself, \u201cI don\u2019t want to start trouble here, either. But if I don\u2019t buy that Gana, Guna will never obey me. I need to think about this.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, the auction hall was full to the brim with people. Many of the Kao were busy, occupied with serving the people that had come to the auction.\n\nAny of the Kings who were present could likely kill each and every Kao there, so no rules were needed.\n\nThere was a Kao that looked like Gia, and she went up on stage. Han Sen could not discern the differences between each Kao. To him, they all looked the same. Their chests were like basketballs, and the smallest of them was like a football.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they have males?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nAfter the Kao said a few words, they brought out a Gana that had been wrapped up in chains. After a brief explanation of the Gana\u2019s identity, the bidding began.\n\nThe Kings were worried, hoping no one would try to steal it. They let their subordinates call out their bids for them.\n\nQuickly, the first Gana was purchased for a high price. And then, one by one, more of the Gana were auctioned off.\n\nGold Jade King let the Duke next to him do his bidding, but he was unable to secure one.\n\nHan Sen felt that something was amiss. The Gana were being treated like a product, but they looked way too calm. The adults, and even the children, didn\u2019t so much as shed a single tear. They calmly allowed themselves to be sold.\n\nThere was no resistance. And after they were purchased, they quietly stood next to their buyers.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong.\u201d Han Sen looked around, but he did not see anything unusual.\n\nThe next one to be sold was the Holy Lady of the Gana. While the cow-headed thing made its introduction, a Gana lady was brought up.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw her, he was in absolute shock. The woman looked exactly like Guna.\n\nShe had a delicate face with white skin. Her waist was extremely slender, and her breasts were mighty and full. She looked just like Guna."
