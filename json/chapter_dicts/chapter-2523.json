    "text": "Han Sen looked at her for a minute. She was spoiled and a touch crazy, but he didn\u2019t want to do as she said. Still, he was not mad. He laughed casually and said, \u201cI have learned all kinds of different geno arts. I\u2019m not a master with them, but I have sufficient skill to use each.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018sufficient\u2019 means different things to different people. Are you sure you have learned these geno arts sufficiently?\u201d Yellow Clothes asked seriously. Her face was solemn.\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t know what was wrong with Yellow Clothes. She was talking like they were competing, and they had to find out which of the two was stronger.\n\n\u201cOkay. In that case, I will test you with the most basic sword skill. Do you know Listening Sword?\u201d Yellow Clothes asked coldly.\n\n\u201cWhat is Listening Sword?\u201d Han Sen had never heard of the skill.\n\nYellow Clothes didn\u2019t laugh at Han Sen for his ignorance. She simply explained, \u201cA sword is like a person. A person is like a sound. We can see a person, but until we speak with them, they cannot truly become a friend. You only need a voice to communicate. In that way, we do not learn who people truly are by their appearance. Swords are this way, too. If you just look at its appearance, you cannot understand what is inside the sword. You need to listen to the sword to truly understand the blade. Only then can you understand it.\u201d\n\nThis was the first time Han Sen had heard of this. He thought it was a very interesting concept, and so he asked, \u201cPeople talk, but swords don\u2019t. How can you hear the voice of a sword?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sounds of instruments are not a language, so how can people listen to music and still understand what emotions it conveys and what it means? Although a sword does not speak, when you use a sword to make a sound, you are hearing the voice of the sword. If you know a sword really well, even if you cannot see the sword, you can know what sword it is by the sound it makes,\u201d Yellow Clothes said.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe what she was saying. He looked at Yellow Clothes and said, \u201cThat means I can pull out a sword and randomly swing it, and by that, Lady Clothes will know which sword I wield?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Yellow Clothes answered. She did so with absolute certainty.\n\n\u201cGreat. I have a sword, and I would like you to unveil my sword,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yellow Clothes turned around and closed her eyes. She said to Han Sen, \u201cYou can swing your sword for me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. Using his body to block her line of sight in case she peeked, he whipped out his Toxic Umbrella Mushroom beast soul.\n\nThe Toxic Umbrella Mushroom was a weapon beast soul, but it was not a sword. It was an umbrella. When it was folded, it was three feet long and could be used as a sword.\n\nHan Sen held the toxic umbrella and waved it around with a couple of sword skills. He kept using the Dongxuan Area to scan Yellow Clothes, in case she was using some sort of geno art to see the umbrella.\n\nHan Sen was too suspicious, though. Yellow Clothes wasn\u2019t using any geno arts to watch him. She was merely listening to Han Sen wave his sword around.\n\nHan Sen had only swung his sword twice before Yellow Clothes said, \u201cThat\u2019s plenty.\u201d\n\nHan Sen put the toxic umbrella away. He looked at Yellow Clothes and said, \u201cPlease tell me what my sword sounded like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sword is bad,\u201d Yellow Clothes coldly said.\n\n\u201cWhy is it bad?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using an umbrella as a sword, you should focus on thrusting and sweeping. Your sword skills were just you slashing,\u201d Yellow Clothes said succinctly.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t surprised. Identifying an item by the sounds it made wasn\u2019t difficult. Han Sen could do it, too. Many Kings could do it, so it was nothing special.\n\nYellow Clothes seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking, and she said, \u201cYour umbrella sounds very bitter. If I am hearing this correctly, it is likely a toxic umbrella. Its sounds are very pure and concentrated. It is likely a King class weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can distinguish its sounds to that level?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Even if someone looked at the umbrella, there should have been no way for them to know that it was toxic. Plus, he was the only person in the geno universe who used a toxic umbrella beast soul. There should have been no way for Yellow Clothes to know what it was. How could she know the toxic umbrella was toxic? Han Sen was confused by this.\n\n\u201cEverything has its reason for being. I can hear swords, and I can hear umbrellas. One skill can be like a thousand skills. There is nothing that can escape my hearing.\u201d Yellow Clothes spoke naturally as if it was a universal truth.\n\nYellow Clothes did sound a bit too boastful, though. Not even a high race alpha would claim to know everything. Yellow Clothes had said this casually, as if it was no big deal.\n\nHan Sen was thinking, \u201cIf this woman is this cocky despite being only King class, she must be someone important to the Sky. Why did I not see her when I was in Sky Palace?\u201d\n\nYellow Clothes could see what Han Sen was thinking, and so she fixed her hair and told him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can use a geno art. Without seeing it, I will tell you about it and its element.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting. I want to see this very magical listening skill.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d Yellow Clothes smiled.\n\nShe had tried so hard to get close to Han Sen and speak to him because she wished to get to know him better. But the best way to get to know him was to see how he practiced his geno arts.\n\nThe theory of listening to sounds was just an excuse that Yellow Clothes had given so she wouldn\u2019t have to explain her real ability. Yellow Clothes had practiced a secret skill of the Very High. It was called Very High Sense, and it could feel anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about hearing. Even if she blocked all seven of her senses, she could still picture everything around her clearly in her mind. Her ability to hear and feel would not be impaired.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe what he was being told, though. He paused for a bit and then turned his hands into stone. It was the Petrified skill he had learned from Left Crazy.\n\nHan Sen was thinking, \u201cThis Petrified skill makes no sound. I don\u2019t think she will be able to hear anything.\u201d\n\nHe only petrified his hands so his arms could still be used. He used his arms to swing his fists. Then he asked Yellow Clothes, who had turned around, \u201cCan you tell what sort of geno art this is?\u201d\n\nYellow Clothes used her Very High Sense to feel every single moment of Han Sen\u2019s movements. She did not turn around, but seeing it behind her, she said, \u201cYour fists sound very heavy and clumsy. It feels rather natural. If I am hearing it correctly, you have employed a petrification skill. And in regards to your punch, if you want to name it, call it Petrified Punch.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked, and he sighed. \u201cLady Clothes is so strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetrification skills are not mainstream. You use secret geno arts quite casually. If I name one incorrectly, you do not have to come to hunt the core bronze tripod with me,\u201d Yellow Clothes coldly said. She wanted to engage Han Sen\u2019s curiosity so that Han Sen would use the geno arts he was good at. That way, she could find out just who Han Sen really was.\n\nDollar and the race of humans were an oddity in the geno universe. No one knew where he was from."
