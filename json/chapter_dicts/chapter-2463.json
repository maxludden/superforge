    "text": "\u201cThis is really the place.\u201d The dragon was too big to land on the island, so it circled overhead. The Extreme King man stood atop the head of the dragon, peering down at the island.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, and he thought to himself, \u201cThe Extreme King have gotten here so quickly?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t recognize this Extreme King man, but he immediately identified the giant dragon beneath the man\u2019s feet. Han Sen had never seen it before, but he knew its name. It was the famous Extreme Purple Demon Dragon. It was deified, and it was a mount for the king\u2019s brother Meng Lie.\n\nMeng Lie was King Bai\u2019s biological brother, and he had become deified a long time ago. He was one of the top ten elites of the Extreme King.\n\nIf even the likes of Meng Lie had come to the Tianxia System to hunt down Han Sen, that showed just how much they wanted him dead.\n\nBut Han Sen couldn\u2019t blame the Extreme King. The king\u2019s son had been murdered. If Han Sen didn\u2019t pay for what he had done, then the dignity and pride of the Extreme King and King Bai would be forever tarnished.\n\n\u201cHan Sen! I know you are here. Do you want to come out by your own volition, or do you want me to come down there and drag you out?\u201d Meng Lie boomed from the air, staring down at the wooden house.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart began to pound. He knew the Extreme King would come after he sent the video, but he hadn\u2019t thought they would arrive so quickly.\n\nHan Sen had expected the demon spirit to be nearby when the Extreme King arrived, so they would have to deal with him before they could focus on Han Sen. But in a surprising turn of events, the demon spirit had yet to appear.\n\n\u201cTwo deifieds have come looking for you. It seems as if you\u2019re in over your head.\u201d The woman looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\nBefore Han Sen could answer, the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon beneath Meng Lie gathered up a sphere of dragon power. It turned itself into a being of purple fire. It was going to smite the island and turn it to ash.\n\nThe woman\u2019s face hardened, and the light of the red lantern she was holding grew brighter. The red light covered the whole island, intercepting the purple fireball. The dragon\u2019s attack was unable to penetrate the light.\n\nThe purple fire burned fiercely and the red light wavered, but it still managed to shield the island from the power of the fire. The purple fire was incredibly wild, but it couldn\u2019t make it past the shield.\n\nThe Extreme Purple Demon Dragon became incredibly angry. It spat out more of that purple fire, but try as it might, it couldn\u2019t displace the red light.\n\nThe woman was unshaken. She raised her lantern and put her hand inside it. When she pulled her hand back out of it, Han Sen saw there was a little flame flickering atop her fingers.\n\nThe woman flicked it at the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon that hovered in the sky. That small flame shot upward, rising until it hit the dragon.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen watched what looked like a nuclear bomb going off. The giant body of the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon was engulfed by a bright red sea of fire. The monster was transformed into a big, burning fireball. It squealed in pain, and its wings flapped madly as it tried to put out the fire that was ravaging it.\n\nBut the more it flapped, the more the fire burned.\n\nHan Sen was frozen. As a fire-aligned deified xenogeneic, the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon should have been able to eat fire for breakfast. Instead, it was burning in intense pain. It was difficult to imagine how terrifying that tiny flame must have been.\n\nThe woman stood as calmly as if nothing spectacular had happened. She continued to hold the big red lantern, and she stood in front of the window, looking up at the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon and Meng Lie.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen saw Meng Lie roll up his sleeves. Then it was like the man turned into a black hole. The red fire on the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon was sucked into that black hole, and it all disappeared. There wasn\u2019t even a whiff of smoke remaining.\n\n\u201cMeng Lie is very powerful,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Why are you protecting a fugitive like Han Sen?\u201d Meng Lie stood atop the head of the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon\u2019s head, looking down at the woman near the window. He frowned.\n\n\u201cThis is my house,\u201d the woman said simply. \u201cYou cannot just come here and attempt to burn it down, killing as you please.\u201d\n\nMeng Lie looked at the woman in the same way. \u201cHan Sen has a deep grudge with the Extreme King. The Extreme King will make him pay with his blood. If you would grant me access to your abode, we will greatly appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t?\u201d The woman wasn\u2019t pleased by Meng Lie\u2019s tone.\n\nMeng Lie had asked her to stay out of the way, but it had sounded more like a command. There was no room for maneuvering or negotiation.\n\n\u201cThen I will forge my own path. The Extreme King are here now, and no one can stop me,\u201d Meng Lie said imperiously.\n\nHearing Meng Lie say that, Han Sen almost burst out laughing.\n\nThe Extreme King had enough power to suppress many races. And all of the top ten deifieds of the Extreme King were a serious threat.\n\nBut Meng Lie had just condescended to the wrong person. This woman had come from the era of the Sacred Leader. The Extreme King\u2019s alpha had been merely a servant to a woman like this, once upon a time. And now, an heir of the Extreme King was talking down to her in such a manner. Han Sen knew what she was going to do, just judging from the man\u2019s disrespectful tone of voice.\n\n\u201cThe Extreme King must be really powerful. I am keen to see how you, a scion of the Extreme King, will build a path that cuts right through me,\u201d the woman said, her voice dripping with contempt.\n\nMeng Lie frowned. The Extreme King were one of the most famous races in the universe, and they had been for a very long time. Furthermore, Meng Lie was the brother of the king. Aside from those of the Very High or the Ancient God, no one ever dared to speak to them in such a way.\n\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Meng Lie flipped his hands out and started to push toward the island.\n\nThe hand became a big print that suddenly covered the whole shield. A hellish godlight burned from the print. It turned into an old word that read \u201cking,\u201d and it was infused with powers for crushing the sky and the ground.\n\nThe clouds of the Tianxia System shook because of that word. The clouds nearby were all rolling, and space was tearing and coming undone under the force of the large print. The whole area had become a dangerous maelstrom of destructive power.\n\nIn Han Sen\u2019s eyes, it was like the whole world was being flattened by that unstoppable word. The island was going to get crushed like an egg.\n\n\u201cYou stole the World Print, and now you have the gall to show it off here?\u201d The woman looked up with disdain. She raised her hands, and a small print appeared on her fingers. She threw it at the big print that was coming down toward the island.\n\nThe small print and the big print collided. Weird symbols flashed across the smaller print. Han Sen couldn\u2019t tell what the symbols meant, but the sight of them was disconcerting. It was like the universe\u2019s destiny now resided in that little print.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe small print hit the big print. Then, the scary big print shattered. It couldn\u2019t repel the small print.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Meng Lie\u2019s face changed. His king print could suppress the sky and earth, and no race should have been able to stop it. But now, a much smaller print had been able to crush it. It was a sight that beggared belief.\n\nHan Sen had used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the conflict. The woman\u2019s small print had a similar structure to the big print, but the smaller variant\u2019s power was much denser.\n\nThey looked roughly the same, but when they ran into each other, but it was like refined steel going up against baked clay. The world shocking king print shattered. It couldn\u2019t compare to the woman\u2019s World Print."
