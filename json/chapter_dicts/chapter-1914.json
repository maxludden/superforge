Where are you taking us?\u201d One of the Viscounts looked at Wang Yuhang very angrily.\n\nThey\u2019d been waylaid by many xenogeneics on the road, and they had yet to see any hint of the red mist spring. The many injuries they had suffered were taking a toll.\n\nExcept for Wang Yuhang, of course. He was leading them, and he could run from his enemies extremely quickly. Whenever he saw movement up ahead, he\u2019d take cover in the crowd. He was the only one not to sustain injuries.\n\n\u201cKid, I\u2019m warning you. You better not be playing tricks on us. Even if Han Sen himself was here, he couldn\u2019t save you.\n\nWe can kill you with the greatest of ease,\u201d the Tego Viscount shouted angrily at Wang Yuhang, grabbing him by the collar.\n\n\u201cYou have misunderstood me! Why would I play tricks? You know how dangerous this place is, and there is an abundance of xenogeneics. We don\u2019t have many people in the base, either, so the mountains remain uncleared. I am taking a huge risk, leading you guys to the red mist spring. The fear of death is not lost upon me, either. I have picked the safest route for us to take, and even so, there really are just too many xenogeneics.\u201d Wang Yuhang gave them the look of someone who had been wronged.\n\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d The Tego Viscount grunted in dissatisfaction and threw Wang Yuhang forward.\n\nYes. And we have to be careful, because this place is dangerous.\u201d Wang Yuhang smiled and got up. He wasn\u2019t mad, and he just swept the dust off and kept moving.\n\nAs they walked, they went across a mountain, at which point Wang Yuhang suddenly started retreating. He also shouted, \u201cEveryone! There is a bunch of xenogeneics ahead!\u201d\n\nBefore any of them could react, they saw a bunch of xenogeneics crossing the distance. There were so many of them, it was like a sea of foes. One of them was wielding some sort of barrier, which marked it as an Earl xenogeneic.\n\nThe team quickly fell into chaos as the group of Viscounts engaged the xenogeneics. Wang Yuhang ran to the back of them, saying, \u201cTrying to be bossy to me, huh? Now you are going to die!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad, Little Uncle.\u201d Han Sen suddenly appeared next to Wang Yuhang and smiled.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? I told Brother Qing you could stay and absorb the spring while I handle these guys. Later, I was planning on taking them to Marquise xenogeneics.\u201d Wang Yuhang smiled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill them. They need to reach the spring. Otherwise, we cannot explain the reasons why they all died. But yes, before they go, we can use them to kill a horde of xenogeneics for us.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cBy getting them to kill the xenogeneics, aren\u2019t they the ones benefitting?\u201d Wang Yuhang asked.\n\n\u201cOf course not. This is Planet Eclipse, and this is all ours. They can kill the xenogeneics, but the materials left behind are all ours for the taking. It\u2019s free labor, man. We should take advantage of it,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nWang Yuhang understood and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll keep leading them as I have been.\u201d\n\nThe people there were Viscounts, and there was just under a hundred of them. But there were three to four hundred xenogeneics, and one of them was an Earl. It was difficult to determine who would be victorious.\n\n\u201cCrap! These guys are so strong. They trapped the Earl xenogeneic,\u201d Wang Yuhang said, with much shock.\n\n\u201cThe people here are the best-of-the-best from Narrow Moon. They are very strong, but the red mist spring has yet to erupt. It would be best if you lead them elsewhere for a bit, and perhaps nab a few more Earls.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cNo problem. I have a handle on things.\u201d Wang Yuhang puffed up and patted his chest.\n\n\u201cWear this, too.\u201d Han Sen gave the Marquise armor to Wang Yuhang. After Han Sen brought up his Dongxuan Sutra to Viscount, he didn\u2019t really need the armor anymore. He only needed his rabbit shoes.\n\nWang Yuhang put on the armor immediately.\n\nThe Viscounts were fighting hard, and it took them half an hour to slay only half of the crowd. Many of them then turned to focus on killing the Earl.\n\nThe Earl was very strong, but it could only use physical methods to fight, and it wasn\u2019t very smart. It was surrounded by elite Viscounts. It was powerful, but it was killed before long.\n\nThe Viscounts all sustained their own injuries, too, but none of them were killed. No one was hurt too grievously, either.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you are here! I thought you were going to disobey the orders of the elders.\u201d A few of the Viscounts, seeing Han Sen there, walked over to him. The Tego Viscount laughed coldly.\n\n\u201cI am a Rebate, too; I wouldn\u2019t disobey orders,\u201d Han Sen said impassively.\n\n\u201cGood, then take us there,\u201d the Tego Viscount said. Other Viscounts then echoed him.\n\n\u201cOf course. I will take you there immediately, but before that, I hope you give us back what we own.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Since when have we given you what we\u2019ve earned?\u201d The Viscounts sounded angry.\n\n\u201cThis is Planet Eclipse. I own all the resources harvested here. You killed my poor xenogeneics. I\u2019m not asking for money, and there you are, going to steal my xenogeneic materials?\u201d Han Sen calmly said.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you must be dreaming. We killed the xenogeneics. If you want xenogeneic materials, you should go and hunt the creatures yourself!\u201d one of them growled at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t give me back these xenogeneic genes, I can\u2019t take you to the red mist spring,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThis is an order from the elders and the Kings. Do you dare disobey it?!\u201d the Tego Viscount shouted.\n\nHan Sen looked at him expressionlessly and said, \u201cPlanet Eclipse is mine. That is also a decree issued by the elders and Kings. You can disobey these laws, but I cannot? I am sure the Kings and the Queen will support me on this matter.\u201d\n\nThe Viscounts looked pensive. Han Sen\u2019s reasoning was solid. And if they failed to take the spring, how would they explain that to their elders upon returning home?\n\n\u201cThe red mist spring is going to erupt any second now. If you\u2019d rather waste time here instead of going there right now, that\u2019s your decision,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nYou b*stard.M One Viscount threw the xenogeneic materials he had gathered upon the ground.\n\nThe Viscounts weren\u2019t willing to lose the red mist spring, so they had to swallow their displeasure and drop the xenogeneic materials. The Viscount that took the Earl class xenogeneic materials hesitated a great deal, but still ultimately had to discard the items.\n\n\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Sword Know stared icily at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYes. Brother Qing, send a few people over to collect the materials.\u201d Han Sen smiled."
