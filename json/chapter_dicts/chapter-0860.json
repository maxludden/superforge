    "text": "Han Sen learnt more about Geno Seeds from Ji Yanran. Perusing the information she provided him, though, he noted that it wasn't very substantial. He did learn that Geno Seeds were able to absorb all manners of genes, and which genes they absorbed would affect what grew inside them.\n\nSome could grow geno equipment, whereas others could grow creatures. Others could form spirits or beast souls. What they chose to grow was influenced by the energies they absorbed.\n\nHumans and spirits knew how to create Geno Seeds that they favored, and this was accomplished by injecting the genes of their choice into one. Doing so would enable the altered Geno Seed to create what the injector specifically sought.\n\nDifferent sanctuaries had different ways of cultivating Geno Seeds. And the stuff they produced was different from place to place.\n\nBut humans lacked a lot of information about Geno Seeds, and as a result, Han Sen was unable to discover anything revealing about the nature of his gourd or the six Cog armaments.\n\n\"It looks like this is a mystery that will only reveal itself once I reach the Third God's Sanctuary.\" After Han Sen deleted the confidential information he had received, he returned to the sanctuary.\n\nAll of a sudden, he received orders bidding him to join a training program.\n\nHan Sen went back to ask Ji Yanran about it, and she said it was a training program of the Alliance. It was something related to the Crystallizer civilization. All members of the Daphne had to take part, including her.\n\nHan Sen had no choice but to join, since he was issued the order. He wasn't strong enough to take-on the entire Alliance yet, so he still had to adhere to whatever order was given to him by the council. Unfortunately for him, however, it threw a wrench in his plans of attacking Devil-Blood Shelter again. It would be delayed.\n\nThe Devil-Blood King had been heavily damaged, and he was lacking his former power. Han Sen believed he could take out Devil-Blood Shelter and max out his super geno points in the process.\n\nSpirit Owl and Death Knell had not finished evolving yet, though, and they were two companions he thought he might need. As a result, he didn't think it'd do much harm to go to the training program first.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived at the training base at Moka Planet, he was surprised to see that it wasn't only his team that was receiving the training.\n\nA lot of Crystallizer Ruin research members would receive this training, as well. All in all, there were more than ten thousand people there.\n\n\"Han Sen! You are Han Sen, yes?\" Immediately after arriving, Han Sen was greeted by someone who fanboyishly recognized him. The man hastily moved to intercept him.\n\nHan Sen was quite happy about this, and he couldn't help but think, \"Haha, I really am rather popular.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am Han Sen.\" The person in front of him was a twenty-year-old soldier. Han Sen was pleased at the reception he was given, and he was about to ask the man if he wanted an autograph.\n\nBut jovially, the young man quickly said, \"It really is you? Sweet! Your fiance is the princess of the Alliance, Ji Yanran. We are very fond of her.\"\n\n\"What the hell?\" Han Sen had rarely felt so awkward. He explained to them, \"Well, for what I suspect you will ask next, the answer is yes. She will be joining the training program, too. You can see her later.\"\n\n\"Whoa! Awesome!\"\n\nA bunch of soldiers began to babble amongst themselves. Then, a woman soldier approached Han Sen and handed him a pen and paper. She politely asked, \"Can I have your signature, please?\"\n\nHan Sen noticed that this female soldier was attractively challenged, but still he thought, \"Well, at the very least, women have better judgment, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Han Sen smiled and accepted the pen and paper, ready to scribble his signature. But just as he was about to bring the pen down on the paper, the female soldier said, \"Can you write, Ji Yanran's fiance for your name?\"\n\nHan Sen almost bit his tongue off, and was tempted to grab her clothes and yell, \"Are you trying to make me look like a fool? How shameless are you, asking me to sign this?!\"\n\nThe female soldier, however, looked like a very shy individual. Despite being disheartened, Han Sen complied with her request and proceeded to scribble down Ji Yanran's fiance.\n\n\"Yay! I have obtained the signature of Ji Yanran's fiance! Woohoo!\" The soldier thanked Han Sen with a frightening amount of glee and hugged the paper tightly.\n\nHan Sen heard a familiar voice laughing somewhere nearby. He turned around and saw a familiar yet strange shadow.\n\n\"Mengmeng?\" Han Sen was very surprised, but still he approached her. He had not expected to see Wang Mengmeng there.\n\nSince he last saw her, she had grown taller. She exuded a sense of greater maturity, but her overall appearance was still an undeniable victim of her babyface.\n\n\"Tell me, Handsome; as the fiance of a princess, do you feel pressured?\" Wang Mengmeng asked, with her eyes wide open in curiosity.\n\n\"Before arriving here, I believed myself to be a figure of greater fame than she was.\" Han Sen was feeling hopeless.\n\nWang Mengmeng smiled and said, \"It's normal, don't worry. The president has a beautiful daughter, and it is not uncommon for people to crave every tidbit of news about what the president is up to. Of course the media chases her, and her title as Princess is formally recognized throughout the entire Alliance. Even the news of your triumph against Yu Qielan referred to you as 'the princess's fiance.'\"\n\nHan Sen wasn't affected by this, however. He simply shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I recall you are a member of the Royal Warframe Team, so how come you are here today? Why are you here, taking part in today's special training?\"\n\n\"Honestly? I'm not sure. Some of us received the order to come, whereas others didn't. Perhaps there is an important operation regarding the Crystallizers?\" Wang Mengmeng hypothesized.\n\n\"Let's walk and talk; where is your room?\" Han Sen spoke as he walked alongside Wang Mengmeng.\n\nIn an office of the training camp, an old man watched a video stream of the ongoing scene between Han Sen and Wang Mengmeng.\n\n\"Teacher, would you like to me to bring Han Sen here?\" Wen Zhong asked the old man.\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"No, there is no need to. I do not wish to make my identity and presence known to him yet. I will continue to watch them in secret, in the meantime.\"\n\n\"Um, I don't think that is very appropriate,\" Wen Zhong said, in surprise.\n\n\"It isn't inappropriate. It makes for a compelling watch, that's all.\" The old man smiled as he looked at Han Sen. Then he said, \"I can see the real him like this.\"\n\n\"Teacher, do you really want to accept him as a student of yours?\" Wen Zhong was hesitant to ask this question, but he did so anyway.\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. First, I have to meet with him,\" the old man said.\n\n\"I still think it is inappropriate. He hails from the Luo family, after all.\" Wen Zhong wore a complicated expression.\n\n\"Then doesn't that make for an even more compelling watch? I, Zhuo Donglai, having a student from the Luo family would be rather interesting, don't you think?\" The old man squinted his eyes, with a smile that could only be defined as perfect."
