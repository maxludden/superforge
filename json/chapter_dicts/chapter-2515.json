    "text": "\u201cFortune teller, where will you run this time?\u201d A woman was gripping a knife in a rock-steady hand. She was holding the knife to an old man\u2019s neck.\n\nCough, cough!\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Put your knife down. We are old friends. We should talk about this,\u201d the man said indignantly.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t keep this knife to your neck, I\u2019m afraid you might just run away,\u201d Yisha growled to the old man.\n\n\u201cWhy would I? Seeing you actually makes me very happy. Why would I run?\u201d The old man forced a smile. His fingers tried to touch the knife against his neck, hoping to move it away.\n\n\u201cStop talking crap. I have been looking for you for the longest time. You must pay the terms of our bargain,\u201d Yisha said emotionlessly. The knife was still against the old man\u2019s neck. The old man dropped his hands away from the blade.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about that? You should have told me sooner. I found out a long time, but because you weren\u2019t looking for me, I thought you didn\u2019t need the information anymore.\u201d The old man looked as if he had just woken up.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Yisha didn\u2019t want to explain. She had been looking for this old man for so long. Finding him hadn\u2019t been easy.\n\nThe old man seemed to be sad, and he said, \u201cI made the calculation far too long ago. He is long gone by now.\u201d\n\nSeeing Yisha\u2019s expression darken, the old man quickly said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll calculate a new bearing for you at once. Three minutes. Give me three minutes, and I will give you Dollar\u2019s location.\u201d\n\nHearing the old man say this, Yisha\u2019s mood lightened a little.\n\n\u201cI will calculate it now. Just stop waving that knife around. You are such a pretty girl, but no one will marry you if you behave like this.\u201d The old man carefully pushed the knife away.\n\nThis time, Yisha didn\u2019t resist. She slid the knife back into its sheath, then turned her expressionless face back to the old man. \u201cYou have three minutes. If I don\u2019t know where Dollar is in three minutes, I am going to make you marry someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d The old man was shocked, and he didn\u2019t know what Yisha meant.\n\n\u201cI will make you the son-in-law to the king of hell,\u201d Yisha grunted.\n\nThe old man smiled wryly. He lifted his hand and began the calculation. He raised his head to Yisha and said, \u201cI lost the bet. I have to admit it. I have your answer, but I also have two locations. One is Dollar\u2019s location, and the other is your student\u2019s location. You know the rules. I only lost to you once, so you can only choose one location. Which do you wish to know more?\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Sen is still alive?\u201d Yisha frowned.\n\n\u201cHe is for now, but he isn\u2019t doing well. If no one goes to save him, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d The old man stopped talking. He just shook his head and sighed.\n\n\u201cCan he still be saved?\u201d Yisha asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cHe can if you go there.\u201d The old man nodded.\n\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d Yisha asked.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cMy lady, are Dragon One and Dia Robber really going to kill the Gold Armor General?\u201d In the core area, a maid-looking woman of the Kate was curiously looking at a woman in a yellow shirt. They were on a ship.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re spending a lot of manpower on this project. It cannot just be for show.\u201d The lady in yellow was attractive and composed. She seemed young, probably no more than twenty years old. But her eyes were alert and intelligent, as if they could see through everything.\n\n\u201cThe Gold Armor General is as good as a deified xenogeneic outside the core. Are they really going to kill it? I have heard that they have hired someone called Dollar, and they seem to have high expectations of him. I don\u2019t get it, though. He hails from some small, nameless race. He achieved first place in the Marquise bracket of the Geno Being Scroll fights, but that\u2019s it. The evolution of his genes can\u2019t be that good. Why would geniuses like Dragon One and Dia Robber place their faith in a guy like that?\u201d the maid asked, still not understanding.\n\nThe yellow-clothed woman laughed and said, \u201cThey\u2019re collecting all the strength that they can. Expensive things are often useful, but we do not know if Dragon One and Dia Robber are using their resources correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lady, Little Butterfly doesn\u2019t understand this. In your territory, you can choose geniuses of the Extreme King, and some of them are already deified. That would save you trouble. Why are you giving up that option, though? To pick a silkworm of some other race? Dragon One and Dia Robber are strong, but they are half-deified. And even when compared to other half-deifieds, they are still worse than the likes of the Extreme King. Am I right?\u201d the maid asked with wide eyes.\n\nThe yellow-clothed woman blinked and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would choose the Extreme King. It\u2019s just that the blood of the Extreme King is quite strong. After all these years, however, I believe they have peaked. Even if they could help me, they cannot improve much more. I prefer someone who can keep improving.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill that make a difference? They will reach the same strength as the Extreme King in the end.\u201d Little Butterfly didn\u2019t understand.\n\nThe yellow-clothed woman laughed. \u201cIt is just like how some people enjoy buying adult dogs to watch over their gardens. I would prefer buying a young one and raising it myself. Watching things grow is fun.\u201d\n\nLittle Butterfly seemed to understand this, and so she said, \u201cYou mean that Dragon One and Dia Robber are like young puppies? And the Extreme King are adult dogs?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d The yellow-clothed woman laughed again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just Dragon One and Dia Robber, though. Other races could fit the bill, too. There are many different breeds of racing dogs; you just need to find the one with the most potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, which do you think has more potential? Dragon One or Dia Robber?\u201d Little Butterfly was curious.\n\n\u201cNeither of them are bad. Their potential shouldn\u2019t be any worse than the Extreme King\u2019s princes and princesses. But they aren\u2019t the best.\u201d The yellow-clothed woman sighed. \u201cOut of all the people I\u2019ve seen, the best still has to be Sky Palace\u2019s Yu Shanxin. Lone Bamboo isn\u2019t bad, but he is probably taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bad thing?\u201d Little Butterfly asked with shock.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that bad. This universe has no lack of geniuses. I just need some more time to find them. Let\u2019s watch Dragon One and Dia Robber for now. Perhaps we might learn something interesting.\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes were like stars. She looked at the sky, thought of something interesting, and smiled. It had a beautiful curve, and she spoke to herself, \u201cVery High\u2019s forgotten love. Although they have big hearts, they are boring.\u201d\n\nMany of the higher races knew Dragon One and Dia Robber were preparing to defeat the Gold Armor General. And so, their every move was watched.\n\nWhen the time for respite was up, Han Sen followed Dia Robber and Dragon One to the system with the Gold Armor General.\n\nThey had eleven half-deifieds with them and six Kings. Most of them were Dragons or Destroyed. There were only two different races.\n\nAlthough Dragon One and Dia Robber could enlist the help of more half-deifieds, they didn\u2019t. The success of this mission wouldn\u2019t rest on the strength of numbers. The trust and cooperation between the fighters were the most important factors."
