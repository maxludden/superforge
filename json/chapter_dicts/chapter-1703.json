    "text": "The crystal armor on Ji Yanran became the crystal shoes again. They started running towards Han Sen. Without the crystal shoes, though, Ji Yanran started to fall from the sky. She wasn\u2019t strong enough to participate in the fight in her ordinary condition.\n\nZach, seeing the crystal shoes leave, raced over to Ji Yanran with the express desire of killing her.\n\nGolden Growler roared. He suddenly made himself as big as a battleship and absorbed the hit Zach was going to deliver. In doing so, he managed to save Ji Yanran and Bao\u2019er both.\n\nA gaping hole was left in Golden Growler\u2019s armor and body as a result, though. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t hurt as much when he was that size. As Golden Growler roared, Ji Yanran and Bao\u2019er were able to get to safety with Luo Lan.\n\nSince Ji Yanran had now lost her crystal shoes, Little Angel and Golden Growler were fighting Zach and Zagu desperately. Fortunately, their opponents had already been damaged by Ji Yanran and Bao\u2019er. If this wasn\u2019t the case, things would have been far worse for Little Angel and Golden Growler.\n\nThe crystal shoes landed right before Han Sen. He put them on. At the same time, the glove armor returned to just being a glove again.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe officer stabbed a number of holes into the ground. He was breaking the planet, but he wasn\u2019t managing to hit Han Sen. The crystal shoes and their power pulled Han Sen away, preventing him from being stabbed.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d The officer was in shock. He looked at Han Sen and the crystal shoes in much confusion now.\n\nThe crystal armor was something special, and ordinary people could not make use of it. Once the shoes recognized someone as their master, they would never betray that master or be used by someone else unless the owner was killed.\n\nThe reason the officer hadn\u2019t killed Ji Yanran was because the shoes would have selected Han Sen as their new master once she was dead. He had the Northern King Glove, after all. It was highly probable that the shoes, given a choice, would select Han Sen as well.\n\nBut the officer did not expect the crystal shoes to willingly follow Han Sen and not strictly remain with Ji Yanran.\n\nHan Sen had been very worried about his family being put in danger during his absence, so he had left the shoes with Ji Yanran. The shoes really did help the family, too, while they were in danger with him gone.\n\nThe crystal shoes never truly obeyed Ji Yanran. When they sensed that Han Sen was in danger, they went over to their master and slipped themselves onto his feet\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t like wearing them, but fashion principles weren\u2019t much of a concern at the moment. He had an enemy he needed to defeat.\n\nThe crystal shoes didn\u2019t become crystal armor around Han Sen, though. They became shoes and the glove remained a glove. Neither item shielded him in the shape of an armorset.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s useless! Even if you have the crystal shoes and the glove, you are still so very weak!\u201d the officer said savagely, swinging his sword once more.\n\nThe fiery wings of the officer sent him flying towards Han Sen with the sword.\n\nHan Sen felt the shoes\u2019 powers dragging him back a few thousand meters. It was too fast for Han Sen to decide how to react himself.\n\nThe crystal shoes on his feet provided him speed. They were much stronger than when they were taking the shape of an entire armor. And the shoes were far faster now than they were when Ji Yanran was making use of them.\n\nBut the officer was still able to catch up. The fiery wings on his back could go faster than the crystal shoes.\n\nSeeing the sword approach, Han Sen remained calm. He went towards it.\n\nHan Sen had the crystal shoes and the glove. He had nothing shielding his body. He had a geno armor inside his Sea of Soul, but he could not use it while he was wearing those other two items.\n\nEven if he could put it on, it still wouldn\u2019t be very good against the Western King Sword.\n\nNow, all Han Sen hoped he could do was use his gloved fist to hit the sword. If he missed, he expected he\u2019d be cut in half.\n\nBefore this, Han Sen had failed many times. He couldn\u2019t block the sword no matter how many times he tried, and neither could he evade it. Now that he had no armor, this was his last chance.\n\nThe officer looked cold, and he didn\u2019t think Han Sen could block it. Just like all the other times, he expected he\u2019d be able to deliver a cruel blow to Han Sen. And furthermore, Han Sen\u2019s body had no protection because there was no armor on him. He could kill Han Sen and take the crystal shoes and glove all for himself.\n\nStay Up Late and the others all turned to look at Han Sen now. He and Han Yufei both knew that if he was unable to successfully block the next strike, he would die.\n\n\u201cLook at his eyes! Look at his eyes!\u201d Stay Up Late shouted out, despite expecting such a call to be practically pointless.\n\nHeart Eye was a technique that was very difficult to teach. When Stay Up Late learned it from the officer, he had practiced the skill for a very long time. After many repeated failures, Stay Up Late managed to wrap his head around it and learn it successfully.\n\nStay Up Late had learned it in the course of training, however. The officer had taught him by using the technique slowly.\n\nmonths of training with it, Stay Up Late found success and managed to learn it It resulted in others calling him a genius.\n\nHan Sen was in the midst of genuine combat, and there was hardly any respite. He couldn\u2019t dedicate much of his mind to learning new things right now.\n\nThe sword and fist collided with each other, but the sword was like a shot that slipped by. It didn\u2019t touch Han Sen\u2019s fist and was instead going straight for his chest.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t block it!\u201d Stay Up Late\u2019s face changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d Han Yufei looked ill.\n\nJi Yanran and Luo Lan were unable to see the situation, and they had no clue Han Sen was in danger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d The officer could feel his sword tearing through fabric and penetrating flesh. It made him feel very good.\n\nAfter this, he would receive all the crystal king armors. If he could combine them all together, he\u2019d have no issue surviving out there.\n\nSeeing the skin on Han Sen\u2019s chest start to break, he added more strength. He had to ensure that he killed Han Sen in a single hit, without giving him any chance of survival."
