Time and space were a freakish duo, but the former definitely made him the wariest. What it could achieve was both fascinating and frightening, and this was what Han Sen thought as he looked at Moment Queen now.\n\nHumans could control space, but not time. They were not technologically advanced enough for time manipulation. In the sanctuary, things were a little different, and time there could be controlled, or at the very least manipulated.\n\nMoment Queen had not opened as many gene locks as Han Sen had, but that didn\u2019t mean he was willing to underestimate her. Han Sen formed another coin between his fingers, but before he could do anything, Moment Queen had already teleported in front of him and delivered a punch.\n\nShe used to be a noble figure, one of divinity and grace. She had been disgraced repeatedly by her service to Han Sen. The final straw was Han Sen\u2019s insult, following her broken body. She could not take it anymore.\n\nMoment Queen attacked Han Sen with all the power she had. She had to vent and release her pent-up frustration with him, but she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d kill her for the act. He\u2019d have to keep her around for moving the shelter, after all.\n\nHan Sen quickly used his phoenix techniques to avoid her thrashing.\n\nHe knew he had avoided her, but in the next second, her wailing fists had become nothing but a blur. And somehow, she had managed to strike him in the stomach.\n\n\u201cWow. Why are you so weak?\u201d Moment Queen wore a cheeky smirk.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s powers were different than Sky King\u2019s, that much was certain. If she battled against Sky King, he\u2019d have been able to kill her in one hit, but doing so would be difficult. Her unique talents most certainly gave her the ability to punch above her weight class.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. Let\u2019s keep this going.\u201d Han Sen activated his Dongxuan Sutra and ran towards Moment Queen.\n\nMoment Queen twirled the dimension around them and got to fighting Han Sen.\n\nWhen it came to the manipulation of time, Moment Queen was in a league of her own. Even with a low amount of gene locks open, she was still frightening to compete with.\n\nAlthough she could not stop time, she could easily rewind the clock on her body and remove damage.\n\nShe could speed up and slow down time, too, while giving her a separate flow to operate on. She was almost as good as Sky King and his ability of warping dimensions, despite the obvious gap in power that was between them.\n\nHan Sen thought she could speed up time to predict the immediate future and what attacks might come her way, too. If that was true, that was similar to the Falsified-Sky Sutra.\n\nMoment Queen was still weak, though. If her talent would eventually lead to that ability, there was still some time to go.\n\nThe ability to speed up time was already quite the showcase of someone\u2019s power, and if Han Sen did not have Dongxuan Aura, he\u2019d have been unable to dodge.\n\nMoment Queen kept on flashing before him with unrivaled speed. Even Han Sen had to stay on his toes and remain sharp. But Moment Queen still kept missing him. He could see the dimension around her was being twisted as she went.\n\n\u201cI could hit him if I was just a little bit faster!\u201d Moment Queen was firing on all cylinders but was just falling short of what was necessary to smack him silly.\n\nBelieving herself to be too slow was just a misconception, though. That being said, it did drive her to give it everything she had. If she was able to move as fast as Sky King, there was no doubt she\u2019d be able to strike Han Sen however she wanted.\n\nBut the Dongxuan Aura was giving Han Sen the edge. By being able to predict her moves, he was evading her attacks before she even began executing them. Her speed wasn\u2019t quite the issue.\n\nAt the very least, Han Sen was now able to gauge how much power Moment Queen had amassed in the time they had been apart and see how far she\u2019d come. While he had been gone, she had managed to open four gene locks.\n\nWanting to keep things fair, Han Sen made sure to only open four gene locks to compete, too. With things like this, their powers were rather even. And balance was what Han Sen wanted. He did everything he could to maintain the equal balance of the sparring session.\n\nFrom a spectator\u2019s point of view, all that could be seen were two wispy shadows brawling like mad in the Martial Hall.\n\nNow, Moment Queen discarded all attempts of maintaining a steady defense. She was now giving Han Sen all she had, with all her focus placed in an attacking stance.\n\nUnlike Han Sen, she could rewind. As such, Han Sen would have to be put on the defensive.\n\n\u201cI can be faster. I know I can!\u201d There was only one thing occupying Moment Queen\u2019s mind, and that was the thought of beating the smirk off Han Sen\u2019s ever-smug face.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nMoment Queen felt like a chain had just broken inside her; her fifth gene lock had now been opened.\n\nHer entire body became a blur before Han Sen, and he could no longer see her fists coming. Then, he was quickly walloped in the chest.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Moment Queen was tremendously overjoyed.\n\n\u201cVery good.\u201d Moment Queen thought of following up the attack with another, but she was taken aback to see Han Sen praise, congratulate, and clap for her.\n\n\u201cYou have opened five gene locks. It seems to me as if you have many king spirit geno points. I think it is time we make good on that deal. Do you remember?\u201d Han Sen patted her on the shoulders and said, \u201cI get half.\u201d\n\nMoment Queen froze. Her excitement and happiness over managing to strike Han Sen had all vanished."
