    "text": "Mister White did mention, however, that there were risks associated with practicing the Xuan Yellow Sutra. The geno art could theoretically reverse a person\u2019s bloodline, but doing so would be very dangerous. Attempting such a feat would have consequences throughout Han Sen\u2019s body. If his body was unable to withstand those effects, the ramifications could be dire.\n\nHan Sen was very tempted to learn it because of the scary powers that the Xuan Yellow Sutra offered, but the risks were severe enough to make him hesitate.\n\n\u201cSince I don\u2019t need to practice the Xuan Yellow Sutra and I don\u2019t actually need to use it, there is no point in me trying to reverse my bloodline.\u201d After Han Sen came to this conclusion, he decided to put the Xuan Yellow Sutra out of his mind.\n\nNow, he turned his attention back to the xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall. He had less than a month to go. If he was unable to kill it in that amount of time, then he would lose this opportunity. He would need to wait for the next doppelganger to show up before he could fight it again.\n\n\u201cHow can I kill it, then? I will have to wait until Li Keer and Exquisite are somewhere else so I can try to kill it with a different geno art. That\u2019s my best chance,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nWhen he left the core area, Li Keer was there waiting for him in the oasis.\n\n\u201cWhy are you back here so soon?\u201d Li Keer wasn\u2019t worried like she had been the last time. She was actually surprised to see him return so quickly.\n\nIn truth, she had been hoping that Han Sen would stay in the core area until the xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall was killed.\n\n\u201cI was just meeting up with a friend. I don\u2019t have much time. I need to kill that xenogeneic in Jail Demon Hall, so I couldn\u2019t stay there for very long,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really going to keep trying, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re planning on returning to Jail Demon Hall,\u201d Li Keer said to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I keep going there? It is rare to tackle such a powerful enemy, and it isn\u2019t as if I have to worry about my safety. This is the perfect opportunity for me to hone my skills,\u201d Han Sen said with sincerity.\n\nLi Keer looked at Han Sen, her head tilted slightly to the side. She could sense that Han Sen was speaking the truth.\n\nNo matter which race they came from, ordinary people would struggle to maintain their drive and dedication in the face of such overwhelming failure. Most people could only have their dreams crushed so many times before they gave up.\n\nHan Sen had failed many times already, but he hadn\u2019t been broken down. His resolve was strong, and he clearly intended to keep on going. That sort of personality had its upsides and downsides, that was for sure.\n\nLi Keer opened her mouth to say something, but no words materialized. She didn\u2019t want to destroy Han Sen\u2019s positivity.\n\n\u201cWhatever. There is only a month left. With his unbreakable determination, it shouldn\u2019t bode too ill for him,\u201d Li Keer thought to herself.\n\nAfter returning to Jail Demon Hall, Han Sen continued to challenge that xenogeneic every day. And every day, he kept failing.\n\nAfter two weeks had passed, Li Keer and Exquisite rarely visited anymore. He had failed far too many times, and he had yet to learn anything new. There was no reason for them to spend time watching such pointless fights.\n\nWhile he was occupied doing his own thing, the girls wanted to practice the knife skill Under the Sky, which they had learned from Han Sen. Although their mental access to Han Sen\u2019s personal experience made it easier for them to cast the powerful skill, they were still having difficulty getting anywhere close to the talent Han Sen had with the skill.\n\n\u201cHe is very talented when he fights. This kind of knife skill and knifemind are very rare to see. He should be a great help for us when practicing the Very High Sense,\u201d Li Keer complimented.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame he isn\u2019t one of the Very High. Otherwise, with his level of talent, he might be able to practice the Very High Sense,\u201d Exquisite said, her voice carrying a distinct note of regret.\n\nLi Keer sneered slightly. \u201cWhat is good about practicing the Very High Sense, anyway? I don\u2019t want to become one of those cold-blooded monsters. If I was given the choice, I would have never decided to practice it, at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is because you have a ten armor talent. Those with an armor talent that high must practice the Very High Sense. That is the rule of being one of the Very High,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cBut why me? I really wish my talents were below nine armors,\u201d Li Keer grumbled.\n\nHan Sen lost his next fight. He stumbled out of Jail Demon Hall, covered with injuries. But then, he suddenly saw a Very High man standing outside the hall looking at him.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t recognize this Very High, but the man\u2019s eyes definitely looked hostile.\n\n\u201cThis guy can\u2019t be Li Xue Cheng, can he?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nIn his time in Outer Sky, Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng were the two people he had offended the most. He had seen Liyu Zhen before, but he had never seen what Li Xue Cheng looked like. Even if this man wasn\u2019t Li Xue Cheng, he was probably related to those two.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you have been using Jail Demon Hall for two months. If you cannot kill the Red Blood Demon, then get out of there. Don\u2019t waste people\u2019s time,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said, staring at Han Sen.\n\nLi Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen had lost everything after the silkworm fights. All they had left were their undies. Their parents had helped them pay back most of their debts, but they still owed a lot to a lot of people.\n\nRight now, the two men had nothing. Literally nothing. Even the resources they needed for practice had to be used as payment for others.\n\nLi Xue Cheng had the idea of fighting the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon xenogeneic gene was required in order to craft a particular deified treasure. If he could get his hands on that xenogeneic gene, then Li Xue Cheng could use it to earn more resources.\n\nLi Xue Cheng couldn\u2019t kill the Red Blood Demon alone, but he had his family backing him. If his family helped, he could probably take down the Red Blood Demon.\n\nBut when Li Xue Cheng went to Open Sky Elder to request admittance to Jail Demon Hall, he was told that Han Sen had already registered there to be the one that killed it. He would have to wait until Han Sen failed before applying again.\n\nLi Xue Cheng didn\u2019t believe Han Sen had what it took to slay the Red Blood Demon, so he came to the Jail Demon Hall to see how things were progressing. And there, he found Han Sen getting repeatedly wrecked by the Red Blood Demon.\n\n\u201cExquisite told me I still have a month to go from the time I was allotted when I was signed up. Is that incorrect?\u201d Han Sen asked coldly, meeting at Li Xue Cheng\u2019s gaze.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the required power, another month won\u2019t make any difference. Why not just give up now? Save yourself some time and stop inconveniencing others,\u201d Li Xue Cheng shot back.\n\n\u201cI see. You say \u2018others,\u2019 but you really just want me to do something that will benefit you,\u201d Han Sen said to Li Xue Cheng, squinting slightly.\n\n\u201cYou are correct. Rather than staying here and wasting everyone\u2019s time, just quit and save us all the trouble,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said flatly.\n\n\u201cYou are right. Making the lives of others more convenient is a nice thing to do. I shouldn\u2019t waste someone else\u2019s time. I should have finished here sooner,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod. He looked like he was agreeing with what Li Xue Cheng said.\n\n\u201cThat is a reasonable way of thinking. If you want to cancel your registration, you must visit Open Sky Elder. I can take you there, if you want,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said, expecting Han Sen to genuinely throw in the towel.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. You misunderstood me. I will kill the Red Blood Demon. Therefore, there will be no need for you to waste more time waiting for me,\u201d Han Sen said with a laugh."
