    "text": "If he was able to save Golden Growler, perhaps there was a chance. Even if it was hard to fight Moment God, they could still possibly escape.\n\nMoment God looked very cold. She did not have any emotions. The 10 fingers on her hands came together. The very 10 ten fingers made a weird print and pressed forward.\n\nSuddenly, the whole of the god temple\u2019s space underwent strange changes. Han Sen saw the slash that almost hit Golden Growler go back.\n\nThings felt as if he was in a video that was rewinding.\n\n\u201cTime Rewind!\u201d Han Sen was shocked. It was very scary that she could stop time almost forever, but it was even more threatening to learn that Moment God could actually rewind time. Even if it was only for a moment, it was too scary to try and comprehend.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d Han Sen coldly shouted. He went backward. He wanted to use his teleportation power to exist Moment God Temple. Moment God had her Time Rewind power. Even if he risked his life, the likelihood of winning was low.\n\nThe green-haired beast and Gana woman knew the situation was terrible. They used all of their power to try and leave Moment God Temple\u2019s radius.\n\nMoment God\u2019s print tied up again. Time rewound again. Han Sen and the others teleported. They all went flying backward.\n\nMoment God\u2019s body moved. She walked over to Han Sen, who had just come back. Her hand reached out for him.\n\nHan Sen was still falling back in the river of time. His body was still going through what he had just done. He was unable to change his movements. His power burst out, but it was useless. He could see Moment God\u2019s palm was going to touch his back.\n\nBlergh!\n\nHan Sen coughed up some blood. His body instantly ripped space. He flew out of the god palace like an asteroid. He was not stopping either. He hit a planet in the universe and blew up the planet. Dust was everywhere.\n\nCreatures from every race were frozen as they watched. Even Godfather Han was unable to beat that enemy. Moment God\u2019s scariness was deeply realized within the heads of every living thing.\n\nMoment God looked at where Han Sen had flown to. She looked weird. It looked as if she was trying to confirm something. She stared at the planet Han Sen had blown up.\n\nThe green-haired beast and Gana woman took advantage of the time when Moment God did nothing. They left Moment God Temple. Moment God did not seem to care about their departure. She stared at the dust in space and ignored them.\n\nHan Sen felt as if his entire back was broken. It was too painful for him to move. He held strong against the pain and used his Galaxy Teleportation to return to Space Garden.\n\nHe teleported halfway. His body was in too much pain. He fell out of the teleportation in the middle of the jump. Bao\u2019er caught him in space. She held him and teleported him the rest of the way. They returned to Space Garden.\n\nBao\u2019er put Han Sen down on the bed and asked with a real look of concern, \u201cDad! Are you feeling better?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad. I am still alive at least.\u201d Han Sen used a lot of power to speak. More blood came out of his mouth.\n\n\u201cI will go and get Little Silver,\u201d Bao\u2019er said. She jumped away and eventually brought Little Silver to the side of his bed.\n\nLittle Silver had very much enjoyed Space Garden\u2019s xenogeneic genes, and Han Sen had fed it the high-level thunder xenogeneic gene. Furthermore, Golden Growler had given him Ancient Thunder God Origin, which had greatly accelerated his ability to level up. He was a primitive deified now.\n\nThe Ancient Thunder God Origin, in particular, had helped Little Silver a lot. It made his genes better. Although his attack power was not very strong, his healing power was far greater.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 It is OK\u2026 I am fine\u2026 Argh\u2026\u201d Han Sen wanted to refuse it, but Little Silver\u2019s lightning landed on him. It made Han Sen\u2019s brain feel numb as he screamed.\n\n\u201cTake off my robe first,\u201d Han Sen said while holding in the pain.\n\nBao\u2019er quickly held Han Sen up. She took off his blue and black striped robe. When she saw his back underneath the robe, she screamed.\n\nThe back of the robe had a big hole in it. The hole was shaped like the woman\u2019s hand. It was where Moment God had struck him.\n\nHan Sen saw the hole of a hand in the robe. It made him develop a wry smile. \u201cFortunately, this robe blocked a little. Otherwise, even if I did not die, I would only have half my life left.\u201d\n\nHan Sen turned around and laid down on the bed. The Spell Armor on his back had the print of a hand as well. Fortunately, it did not pierce through him.\n\nEven so, Han Sen\u2019s backbone had almost been destroyed. It was very hard to cast power across his body.\n\n\u201cAnnihilation class God Spirits sure are scary. I couldn\u2019t even use a super God Spirit body to challenge it.\u201d Han Sen wanted to get up, but Little Silver amplified the amount of lightning he was using.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body felt very itchy and numb again. He screamed again. \u201cArgh!\u201d\n\nLittle Silver\u2019s thunder healing was not bad. It helped Han Sen\u2019s true god body, but the treatment process was as awful as ever.\n\nAfter Han Sen felt a bit better, he was going to let Little Silver go. Little Silver insisted on fixing him. He kept releasing lightning to electrify Han Sen. It made his legs go soft.\n\nIt was a shame Little Silver was only primitive class. After he used all of his thunder power, he was still unable to patch up Han Sen\u2019s entire body.\n\n\u201cOK, OK, I am feeling much better now.\u201d Han Sen held his pain in and got out of bed. He looked outside the room and saw Moment God Temple in space.\n\nMoment God had returned to her god temple somehow. One was no longer able to see her. Golden Growler was still trapped in the plaza in front of the god temple. It looked like Moment God was not in a rush to kill it. Or, perhaps she was afraid of something and decided not to kill Golden Growler.\n\nHan Sen sighed. As long as Golden Growler was not killed, he had a chance.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cI wonder if that Annihilation Sky God Crown with my xenogeneic body can save Little Gold from Moment Temple.\u201d He did not think his chances were very high. Moment God\u2019s Time Rewind was too scary. Whenever time was reversed, Han Sen was unable to do anything to combat it. Even with powerful power, he could not cast it.\n\n\u201cUnless I can stay in super God Spirit mode, I will not be affected by Time Rewind. Then, I can save Little Gold Gold.\u201d Han Sen looked at Moment God Temple and Golden Growler. His face kept changing."
