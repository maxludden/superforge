    "text": "\u201cHow would that work, exactly?\u201d Han Sen looked at Exquisite in shock.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s strange about it? Since you\u2019re already being watched by one person, being watched by another is practically the same. You just need to share your experiences with one more person. It won\u2019t be detrimental to you in any way, and you can double the benefits you receive. You will receive the same amount of resources from me and my little sister. Effectively, you\u2019ll be receiving double what others receive. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful?\u201d Exquisite said to Han Sen with a beaming smile.\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re correct, but I still think there might be a problem with this plan,\u201d Han Sen quietly said.\n\n\u201cWhat could go wrong? Aren\u2019t you happy about being able to receive twice the resources?\u201d Exquisite thought about it a bit, and then said, \u201cIf you become Li Keer\u2019s silkworm, you can even receive more star fruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the elder is no longer here. I thought the star tree would stop giving out fruit,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just giving you an example. There are many more resources like the star tree on the path ahead, and you will be receiving a double portion,\u201d Exquisite said. Then, she clapped a hand on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder and teleported away. They went straight to the altar where Han Sen had signed his contract with Exquisite.\n\nHan Sen signed another contract to become Li Keer\u2019s silkworm.\n\nBecause Exquisite was there, though, Han Sen kept his mind carefully blank. He waited until he was alone, out of Exquisite and Li Keer\u2019s range of connection, before thinking things over some more. He was in a bad situation.\n\n\u201cI wonder if the small jade figure can absorb two marks. If it can\u2019t, I\u2019m going to be exposed.\u201d Han Sen quickly brought out the small jade figure as he mulled over his situation. He moved to transfer Li Keer\u2019s branding onto the small jade figure.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen\u2019s biggest worries didn\u2019t come to fruition. The mark was successfully applied to the small jade figure.\n\n\u201cSince the jade figure managed to absorb the additional mark, this situation is a good thing, I suppose. It makes little difference if I\u2019m watched by one person or two. And if it means I can earn double the resources, where is the harm in that? I guess this is a lucky turn of events?\u201d Han Sen still couldn\u2019t convince himself that this was a good thing, though. He felt as if there was something dangerous about the situation, but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what it was exactly.\n\n\u201cExquisite has been talking a lot about these rewards that I\u2019ll be earning. I wonder what they are? I hope I can get my hands on some deified xenogeneic genes,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nIn the meantime, Exquisite and Li Keer were standing in a hall, signing Han Sen up for the silkworm bouts. That was the rewards Exquisite had been talking about.\n\nThe silkworm fights provided many resources to the victor, but the silkworm had to earn them. The higher rank they were, the more resources they would receive.\n\nThere were 13 Very High students and 12 silkworms. If someone ended up outside the top 10, their rewards would be practically nothing.\n\nRanks five to ten weren\u2019t much better. Their rewards were fairly small, but things got much better for those in the top five. Going up sequentially, each rank gave double what the last received.\n\nThe prizes had been structured in that way to inspire the silkworms to work their hardest in battle. The Very High wanted them to bring out everything they had.\n\nIt was important for the young Very High to feel the life and death fights of their silkworms. They needed to feel every ounce of emotion such battles could draw out. And they could do it all from the comfort of their seats. They could experience the dire straits of mortal combat without ever putting themselves in danger. Only the Very High had a system that allowed their students to do such a thing.\n\nThe Very High were surprised to find out that Exquisite and Li Keer were sharing the same silkworm. It had happened before in the history of the Very High, but it was a very rare occurrence.\n\nThe Very High that practiced the Very High Sense didn\u2019t comment on the arrangement, but the Very High like Liyu Zhen were less reserved with their opinions.\n\n\u201cLi Keer and Exquisite are using the same silkworm. That Han Sen is quite lucky. He has benefitted from our people yet again,\u201d Liyu Zhen said coldly.\n\nLi Xue Cheng laughed and said, \u201cBeing the silkworm of two Very High masters won\u2019t be good for him, all things considered. Although he can earn double the resources, his responsibilities will also be doubled.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Li Xue Cheng went on to say, \u201cPlus, once he causes many of the Very High to lose their wagers in the silkworm fights, it will be very difficult for him to gain resources anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou collected the bets?\u201d Liyu Zhen laughed.\n\n\u201cI collected them all before it was announced that silkworms wouldn\u2019t be able to use treasures in the battle. I won\u2019t let the gamblers bail now.\u201d Li Xue Cheng\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cHan Sen just needs to not get first place in the silkworm fights. Then, we will be rich. The resources we gain will be enough to make us deified. They will take us to larva class, at least. And some of the treasures are so rare that we couldn\u2019t have bought them with all the resources in the world. But if we lose, there is no way we can pay it all back.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could we lose?\u201d Liyu Zhen said with a laugh. \u201cEvery single silkworm is at least half-deified. They are half a level higher than Han Sen. And if push comes to shove, the born-deified will be mopping the floor with him. No matter how strong Han Sen is, he will never get any further than number two.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. No matter how strong a ninth-tier King is, they cannot beat a deified. Plus, that born-deified is very talented. He isn\u2019t much weaker than the Very High students themselves. He is very good when compared to our members at the same level. Beating a mere King will be a trivial task for him,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said with assurance. He was confident he was going to win this bet.When Exquisite and Li Keer finally explained the \u201crewards\u201d that they\u2019d been promising, Han Sen shook his head. \u201cThis is the \u2018good stuff\u2019 you\u2019ve been talking about? I will have to fight for my life in there. And I can only join as a single person. Why would there be double benefits for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have both of us to support you. Isn\u2019t that twice the benefits?\u201d Exquisite said flatly.\n\nHan Sen and Li Keer looked at Exquisite, gobsmacked. Han Sen didn\u2019t know if Exquisite was just fooling around, but Li Keer was especially surprised by seeing how Exquisite was behaving. It was hard to believe this was the same Exquisite she had grown up with.\n\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? If you have the time, read the files I\u2019ve sent you about your opponents. And remember, the higher the rank you achieve, the more resources you receive. If you can reach second place, you will get a deified treasure amongst many other resources,\u201d Exquisite said calmly.\n\n\u201cWhat about becoming number one?\u201d Han Sen kept looking at the information he was giving while he asked.\n\n\u201cThere is a born-deified participating in this fight. He will probably secure first place. You just need to try your best to be second,\u201d Exquisite said with a small shrug.\n\n\u201cA born deified is joining? And I can\u2019t use treasures? I suppose I will have to settle for second, then,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod. If he couldn\u2019t use his peacock king soul robe and the Six Core Snake Bow, he didn\u2019t think he could beat a deified elite. Not even a primitive one, which was the lowest tier of deified."
