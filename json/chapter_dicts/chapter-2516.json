    "text": "Dragon One and Dia Robber knew many people were watching them, but they didn\u2019t care.\n\nKilling the Gold Armor General was an incredibly ambitious goal, and it would be a cooperative effort. Keeping their preparations under wraps would be almost impossible, so they didn\u2019t bother to try.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, according to the plan, we will deal with the Gold Armor General. All you need to do is find the right opportunity for your attack. You need to have pinpoint accuracy. If the opportunity is squandered, there won\u2019t be a second chance,\u201d Dragon One reminded Han Sen.\n\nDragon One wasn\u2019t trying to be annoying; this was simply a huge deal. The Dragon had already paid a high price for this operation. And the thousand King class xenogeneic genes he was giving Han Sen was not a small sum. They couldn\u2019t afford to waste so much preparation and resources.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t someone who usually took on employers, but they really were paying him a lot of xenogeneic genes. It wasn\u2019t difficult to give them verbal confirmation, once again, that he would do his job. He had to satisfy their anxiety.\n\n***\n\n\u201cCrown prince, Dragon One and Dia Robber are going now,\u201d Nightmare Knight said, as he bowed before Bai Wan Jie.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let us see how much they can accomplish.\u201d Bai Wan Jie moved out to lead the members of royal knights towards the region that the Gold General Armor occupied.\n\n***\n\n\u201cMy lady, this place is very popular. There are many familiar faces around.\u201d A small ship was parked near a mountain that looked like an asteroid. Little Butterfly, the maid, looked out across the galaxy and spoke.\n\n\u201cKilling the Gold Armor General is a huge goal. It is understandable that Kings and half-deifieds from all over have come to watch. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be here in case they discover so way to take advantage of the situation?\u201d the yellow-clothed woman asked in a toneless voice.\n\n\u201cAre you saying that they\u2019ve come to steal the Gold Armor General from Dragon One?\u201d Little Butterfly was shocked.\n\n\u201cNot quite, but most people are sure to have that thought in their minds,\u201d the yellow-clothed woman said. Her eyes brightened. Dragon One and Dia Robber entered the system.\n\nThe yellow-clothed woman looked at Dragon One and then at Dia Robber. Then, her eyes stopped on a person wearing pitch-black armor. His face was hidden.\n\n\u201cIs that Dollar?\u201d the yellow-clothed woman asked herself. She stared at him.\n\nAs the woman focused on him, he suddenly turned around and seemed to look back at her. The woman was stunned. The man in black armor had turned his head in her direction, but he didn\u2019t even pause as he continued flying forward with the others.\n\n\u201cDoes he know that I was watching him, or was that just a coincidence?\u201d The woman frowned.\n\nShe had looked at Han Sen with her eyes, not activating any special abilities. Even a deified creature shouldn\u2019t have been able to tell she was watching him.\n\nBut it seemed like the figure in black armor had turned to meet her gaze. Whether it was on purpose or an accident was unknown.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m overthinking this.\u201d The woman shook her head. Her body and geno arts were special. Noticing her gaze should have been impossible.\n\nHan Sen had been flying forward with the others when he felt as if he was being watched. Although many people were keeping an eye on them, this particular stare felt different. That was why Han Sen turned to take a look.\n\nWhen he looked, all he saw was a belt of asteroids. He knew the watcher was somewhere among the floating rocks, but he also knew that the stare hadn\u2019t been hostile. Because it seemed non-threatening, Han Sen didn\u2019t spend much time searching.\n\nThe woman watched for a while and frowned. Even with her eyesight, she couldn\u2019t tell the strength of Han Sen\u2019s genes. This surprised her.\n\n\u201cThis Dollar is intriguing. I cannot wait to see the limit of his power,\u201d the woman murmured to herself with interest.\n\nAfter Dragon One and the others entered the system, they headed for a meteorite. The Gold Armor General always stayed near asteroids. It was a space xenogeneic, so it wasn\u2019t interested in living on a planet.\n\nHan Sen was ordered to wait near the outer edge of the asteroids. Dragon One and Dia Robber went deeper into the asteroid belt where the asteroids were clustered more tightly. There were too many of the rocks for Han Sen to could accurately. But not long later, a gold swordlight flashed through the asteroids, parting them.\n\nAnd then, Han Sen saw Dragon One and the others retreat from the asteroid belt. Following them was a three-meter-tall golden body.\n\nThe gold body wasn\u2019t very large, but it was obscenely powerful. The gold armor made the being look like a robot. It seemed heavy and powerful, and there were many gold cogwheels and pipes across its surface. It was like a gold robot warrior.\n\nOn its back was a red cape that looked as if it had been made of blood. Its hands were clutching a gold greatsword, and the blade of the sword was taller than the fiend\u2019s body.\n\nThat greatsword was different from normal greatswords, too. Instead of being a single piece of metal, the inner portion of the blade was filled with gold cogwheels. The outer edge of the blade was serrated like a saw.\n\nWhen the gold cogwheels inside the blade spun, the teeth on the edge of the blade began to rotate. It was like a giant gold chainsaw.\n\nIn the center of the sword was a yellow crystal. It looked like it held the essence of lightning inside it. It was the type of lightning that struck when things were born.\n\nLooking at the Gold Armor General was a very weird experience. It seemed both lifelike and soulless, just like a robot. It was hard to say if it was a living thing or an actual robot.\n\nThis was the first time Han Sen had seen a xenogeneic as special as this. He had encountered many metallic xenogeneics before, but it was a first for him to see a xenogeneic that was half biological and half robotic.\n\nSeeing its blood cape and saw-like greatsword, he knew the enemy was very unique.\n\nThe Gold Armor General\u2019s eyes flashed gold. Due to the fact it had a helmet, Han Sen couldn\u2019t tell if the enemy had a mouth. But he didn\u2019t hear it make a sound as it swung its sword at Dragon One.\n\nHan Sen could see clearly that the creature\u2019s gold greatsword was like a saw. The swordlight it unleashed spun like mad. It looked as if it could cut through the fabric of space. Wherever the swordlight went, space would break and cracks would form in the nether.\n\nBut when it slashed downwards, cracks spread rapidly through space until they looked like galaxies in the sky.\n\nThe swordlight came for Dragon One. At the speed they were moving, Dragon One and his party would be unable to dodge swordlights like those.\n\nAs Han Sen wondered how Dragon One was going to block that scary swordlight, a half-deified Destroyed opened his area. It wrapped around Dragon One and the others, then disappeared. The next second, Dragon One and the others reappeared right next to the Gold Armor General.\n\n\u201cGroup Galaxy Teleport,\u201d Han Sen breathed in surprise. He didn\u2019t know the Destroyed had geniuses like that."
