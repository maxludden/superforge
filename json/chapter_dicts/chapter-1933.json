    "text": "Moon Wheel King was right. Han Sen\u2019s Moon only had thirty percent of his own gentle power, and that was because Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra had only been able to simulate thirty percent.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra was still at a low level, though, so he was still pleased that he had managed to simulate thirty percent. If his Dongxuan Sutra ascended, it would not be difficult to increase that percentage.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you are good for causing people trouble.\u201d Yisha sighed. She had already learned about the incident in which he performed Moon.\n\nJust as Han Sen had believed, Yisha had given him Moon as another test. He had only practiced it for a short time, and he had only seen the Narrow Moon Knife once. The fact that he had still managed such a breakthrough was astounding, and it allayed her fears. She no longer had trouble believing Han Sen, and she was sure he really was just that talented.\n\nIt did give Yisha conflicted feelings, though. Anyone would love to have a student that talented, but every time she thought about how hard it was to level up Han Sen, it gave her a headache.\n\nYisha sighed and spoke to herself, \u201cI need to make a plan to see where he can go in order to level up. I can\u2019t wholly rely on my finite supply of resources. It won\u2019t take him very far.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was back on Planet Eclipse, and while the feeling and memory were still with him, he continued his practice of Moon. That gentle skill was quite useful, and it suited Han Sen well.\n\nWhen Han Sen had a chance at night, he\u2019d return to the sanctuary to be with his family.\n\nToday, Han Sen went home. Luolan and Han Yufei looked happy. They spoke to Han Sen and said, \u201cA baby\u2019s coming! A baby\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body shivered. His eyes opened wide, staring at his parents. He complimented them, saying, \u201cDad, you are still very manly. Are you saying I have another little brother or little sister on the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Luolan hit Han Sen across the head. She blushed, and happily said, \u201cIt\u2019s Yanran! She\u2019s having a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d Han Sen was so happy, he almost jumped.\n\n\u201cGo and see her.\u201d Han Yufei patted Han Sen on the shoulder.\n\nThe family was happy that Ji Yanran was pregnant. It helped to reduce the trauma of Littlleflower having been taken, and Ji Yanran particularly felt better because of it.\n\nShe had only been pregnant for three months, though. So, it would be a while before the birth.\n\nHan Sen had told people he was off to kill xenogeneics as an excuse. That way, he could spend a lot more time with Ji Yanran at home.\n\nPeople worked at the base, and he didn\u2019t really need xenogeneic genes. His Viscount gene tally was already maxed out, anyway. Until he became an Earl, there was no point in eating xenogeneic genes.\n\nHan Sen wanted to stay with Ji Yanran until she delivered, but the base soon had news. Yisha was going to the Buddha, and she wanted Han Sen to go with her. Han Sen couldn\u2019t decline, so he packed his stuff and went to Planet Blade. There, he got on a ship alongside Yisha.\n\n\u201cMy Queen, why are you going to see the Buddha?\u201d Since Han Sen was here, he wanted this to be over as soon as possible.\n\nYisha was flying the ship. She didn\u2019t look at Han Sen, and she wasn\u2019t using her ordinary battleship. She was driving a smaller ship, where only she and Han Sen could occupy it.\n\n\u201cBurning Lamp Alpha gives a speech every century. We are going to listen to him speak, with the Buddha,\u201d Yisha said. \u201cIs he the leader of the Buddha?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nYisha nodded and said, \u201cBurning Lamp Alpha is the one that lit the geno lantern. There aren\u2019t many of these alphas still alive amongst the higher races.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeified elites? We really should listen to his words carefully!\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nSurprisingly, Yisha said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to listen to the speech. But you do have to go to the Buddha\u2019s heaven.\u201d \u201cHeaven?\u201d Han Sen looked at Yisha with confusion.\n\nYisha smiled and said, \u201cAfter the alpha has made his speech, he will open up heaven. People are only allowed to go there once in their entire lifetime. I have already been. I am taking you there so you can walk through their heaven. It might help you level up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the benefits of walking there?\u201d Han Sen asked, blinking.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to say. If you walk well, it might help you greatly. If you walk poorly, you might not gain anything at all. You will find out when you\u2019re there, so there\u2019s no point in me explaining it to you right now,\u201d Yisha said shortly.\n\nHan Sen was curious about the Buddha, particularly because of Ancient Devil. He really wanted to know more about them.\n\nIf what Ancient Devil said was true, Asura was somehow connected to the Buddha. And even the Shura of the Alliance and the Demons of the geno universe had some link to the Buddha.\n\nThe Buddha were friends of the Rebate, and they weren\u2019t too far away from each other. Yisha drove the ship fairly lackadaisically. She wasn\u2019t in much of a rush.\n\n\u201cThis planet is called Planet Magic. It is one of the planets of the Buddha. The planet is controlled by the Magic. They are an interesting race. It\u2019s good that you will get a look at them.\u201d Yisha parked her ship in the spaceport and took him to disembark with her.\n\nHan Sen wanted to get all this done as soon as he could, so he could get back to spending time with Ji Yanran. But he couldn\u2019t change Yisha\u2019s mind, so he followed her around.\n\nWhen he stepped off the ship, he saw a creature that was reminiscent of a basketball. It wasn\u2019t exactly like one, but they were circular. They were around the same size as one, and they came in a variety of colors. Their textures were jellylike, and they hopped to move around. They had big eyes, and they looked really cute.\n\n\u201cThese jellies are the Magic?\u201d Han Sen asked curiously.\n\nYisha nodded. \u201cThey are a special race. They are not hostile, but their attack power is more surprising than you would think.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen wished to ask why, a pink glob of jelly hopped in front of them. It looked right at Yisha. And then, suddenly, it made a pop noise. The pink jelly took on Yisha\u2019s shape.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide in shock. Aside from the weaker energy, the pink jelly became Yisha and looked exactly like her.\n\nYisha did not seem to mind the mimic, and she even stroked the Magic\u2019s head. It enjoyed the touch, and it rubbed her hands.\n\nHan Sen reached out to touch it, too, but Yisha gave him a stem look. It was then that Han Sen realized that if he fondled the Magic, it would practically be the same as him touching Yisha.\n\nIt was a shame, but he withdrew his hand.\n\n\u201cWelcome! Our Magic baby was born not too long ago. Are you guys interested in it?\u201d The Magic that looked like Yisha spoke.\n\n\u201cSh*t! What is this? Are they selling kids? They have a planet protected by the Buddha, so they can\u2019t be doing anything that bad!\u201d Han Sen thought."
