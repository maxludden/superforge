    "text": "Inside the bathroom, Han Sen looked at himself in the mirror. He was topless, observing his back.\n\nWhen Han Sen went to sleep the night before, Ji Yanran told him he had a mark on his back. When Han Sen checked it out, he noticed his entire back was tattooed red.\n\nThe tattoo on his back was like a cat, but not a cat. It was like a fox, but not a fox. It was red. It was the Nine-Life Cat.\n\n\u201cWhy is there a tattoo? Is it because of the Nine-Life Cat pendant?\u201d Han Sen examined the tattoo on his back closely.\n\nBut he did not notice anything special about it. It really did just look like a tattoo and nothing more.\n\nHan Sen could not tell what it was, or whether or not it was harming his body. He ignored it, put his clothes back on, and exited the bathroom.\n\nStay Up Late was in the living room. Seeing Han Sen come out, he poured him some tea and looked him up and down. He was curious how Han Sen had been rebuilt, despite entering a God\u2019s Door summoned by someone else.\n\nHan Sen sat down on the sofa. He wanted to ask Stay Up Late something, too. Han Sen accepted the tea and asked Stay Up Late, \u201cI ascended successfully, but I was unable to generate a geno armor. There are no creatures here that I can use to gain genes, either. How am I supposed to generate the geno armor, exactly?\u201d\n\nStay Up Late thought about this for a moment, and then said, \u201cYou cannot borrow power from the outside. You are on your own. After being cleansed and rebuilt, your body is like an unopened chest. You need to practice your genes to grow your body. Do that, and then you will be able to generate your geno armor. That will be your beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the beginning and also the end, right?\u201d Han Sen looked at Stay Up Late.\n\nStay Up Late nodded and answered, \u201cI suppose. Only geno armor has the power to exit the sanctuary. But outside the sanctuary is scary, and it is rather unknown. My people, the crystallizers, were almost entirely wiped out.\u201d\n\nSeeing Stay Up Late open up and be so honest, Han Sen found himself quite surprised. He proceeded to ask, \u201cWhat is out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just an ordinary soldier. I don\u2019t know much about the outside world. If you would like to know, go and see for yourself.\n\nIt is pointless asking me.\u201d Stay Up Late paused for a moment, and then went on to ask, \u201cHow did you level up via someone else\u2019s path? It should be impossible for someone else\u2019s rebuilding powers to match your body.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my body decomposed, it just happened. The rebuilding powers didn\u2019t rebuild my body, and actually harmed my geno cores and molecules. But then, something just seemed to change. I\u2019m not entirely sure what happened.\u201d Han Sen was being half honest.\n\nStay Up Late frowned, and then said, \u201cI have never heard of something like this before. Rebuilding your own body from someone else\u2019s rebuilding power will affect you. Whether it will be for the better or worse, I can\u2019t determine. If you do not mind, you should conduct a full body test so I can find out exactly what is happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen agreed to this. He wanted to know what his body was doing, and he wanted to know if he was strong in a crystallizer\u2019s eye.\n\nAfter conducting the tests, Han Sen\u2019s fitness was revealed to have been lowered. His strength and speed were only ten thousand now.\n\n\u201cIs this good for a crystallizer?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Stay Up Late.\n\nStay Up Late looked back at Han Sen with a complicated expression and said, \u201cFor a juvenile, this is good.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart sank. After all those years, Stay Up Late could only compare him to a juvenile. That was depressing.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know Stay Up Late was actually pleasantly surprised. The sanctuaries were something of an incubator for the crystallizers. Creatures that ascended to the Alliance were mere babies to the crystallizers. After they were rebuilt, they could grow from there.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fitness was far better than a baby crystallizer, but where he\u2019d go from here was uncertain. If he grew up fast, and after he generated his geno armor, Han Sen would definitely be scarier than a crystallizer.\n\nAs he left the testing room, a gold lion dog came up to him. Its tail was wagging.\n\nIt was Golden Growler. Its body was small, not too different from an average dog. It really did look like one, and he was certain others might not be able to tell what it actually was.\n\nBao\u2019er was riding upon Golden Growler\u2019s back. And then, she leaped onto Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\nHan Sen patted Bao\u2019er on the head. Without Bao\u2019er, he was not sure if he\u2019d have been able to rebuild his body successfully. Now that Bao\u2019er was in the Alliance with him, though, she could not return to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nHan Sen did not know if the gourd on Dark Spirit\u2019s Holy Vine was something Bao\u2019er could use. There was no way to find out now.\n\nThis was the biggest regret Han Sen had, regarding his time in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. Fortunately for him, however, he had friends there. He would eventually send someone to take a look once the gourd had matured.\n\nIt would be great to be able to bring it back. He just wasn\u2019t sure if he could.\n\nWhen Han Sen returned home, Ji Yanran was waiting for him. There were many contracts awaiting Han Sen\u2019s signature. They had bought a large portion of land to prevent another incident in which innocent victims could be caught in the crossfire and harmed.\n\nJi Yanran bought out a few cities. If a fight like that happened again, at least others wouldn\u2019t be hurt.\n\nHan Sen signed the agreements and went to practice his skills.\n\nJadeskin did not have a second part, so he had not practiced that.\n\nHan Sen was trying to practice the Blood-Pulse Sutra, the Dongxuan Sutra, and The Story of Genes. The Story of Genes was making progress the fastest, and it seemed as if that was what it took to generate geno armor.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra and the Dongxuan Sutra were far slower, by comparison. They were much different from The Story of Genes, and they weren\u2019t used for generating geno armor.\n\nHan Sen did not know which was better to focus on, so he just divided his time between them all. They did not clash with each other, so it was okay to practice them all at the same time.\n\nHis rebuilt body was different now. When he cast skills, his genes would change. That should have been impossible for a human.\n\nStay Up Late said that if they changed a lot, they would generate the geno armor."
