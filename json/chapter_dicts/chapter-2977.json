    "text": "Han Sen looked at God and said, \u201cYou got here at just the right time. Why did I become a God Spirit for just wearing this Sky God Crown?\u201d\n\nGod laughed and said, \u201cYou did not become a God Spirit. Because the Sky God Crown is here, you temporarily became a God Spirit. If you remove the Sky God Crown, none of that will exist.\u201d After hearing that, Han took off the Sky God Crown and departed the god temple. When he put the Sky God Crown again, he returned to that god temple. The white god flag appeared in front of him.\n\n\u201cIs that all this Sky God Crown does?\u201d Han Sen was disappointed. To him, becoming a God Spirit did not appear to be particularly useful.\n\nGod sat down on the god altar\u2019s edge and casually asked, \u201cIs that still not enough for you? You do not need to do what God Spirits do, but you get to enjoy the benefits of a God Spirit. Many God Spirits would like that.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped as he quickly asked, \u201cWhat responsibility and benefits do gods have?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as you wear the Sky God Crown, if the Sky God Crown is not broken, you will be like other God Spirits,\u201d God said. \u201cYou will have an immortal body inside the god temple. Even if you are killed, you will respawn here in the god temple.\u201d\n\nHan Sen lifted his lips and asked, \u201cWhat does that mean? I do not want to be stuck inside a god temple forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, it does have meaning. For example, if you are up against a powerful enemy that you cannot beat, you do not need to be afraid of dying when you are in the god temple. You can fight them without fear.\u201d God laughed.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cThat does not make sense. If I were killed by my enemy, he would just take my god flag. Then, I would end up dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the power of Sky God Crown. Even if someone removes your flag, it will just break your Sky God Crown. You will still respawn, but you will lose the authority of being a God Spirit.\u201d God pointed at the Sky God Crown and went on to say, \u201cPlus, when you\u2019re a God Spirit, you have the authority of a God Spirit. You can trade with any creature in the universe and gain their lifespan.\u201d Han Sen had always wondered that. The God Spirits were immortal existences, so why did they require the years of others?\n\nBased on God\u2019s method, they used a lot of effort. They would do anything for another creature\u2019s life span. Han Sen did not understand why they did it.\n\n\u201cTo the immortal God Spirits, what is the point of extending their life span?\u201d Han Sen pretended to look disdained.\n\n\u201cAbout that, you will understand in the future.\u201d God did not answer Han Sen\u2019s question. He laughed and told Han Sen, \u201cAs for the responsibilities of gods, it is quite simple. There is only one task, which is to protect the geno hall and forbid it from being invaded by other creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtect the geno hall?\u201d Han Sen asked with an obvious look of confusion. \u201cDoes the geno hall require protection? Let\u2019s not talk about other things, but that woman inside the geno hall is invincible.\u201d\n\nGod shook his head. \u201cThe goddess you talk about is one of the 12 Annihilation class God Spirits. Those 12 Annihilation class God Spirits guard the geno hall in sequence. Their responsibility is the same as all the other God Spirits though. There is no difference between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the geno hall? Does the geno hall have no God Spirits?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked. God laughed but did not answer. \u201cWhen you enter the geno hall, you will understand. As long as you have the Sky God Crown, you will earn the benefits of a God Spirit minus the responsibility. You can also give up the God Spirit identity whenever you please. Are you still not satisfied with this good stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cAside from all that, Sky God Crown has no battle abilities?\u201d Han Sen still thought it was useless for him to become a God Spirit.\n\nGod laughed. \u201cOf course! The Sky God Crown is almost indestructible. Its durability is stronger than most Annihilation class god personality armaments. You can use it like a brick, but the item itself does not have battle power. OK, you should think of a powerful title now. Once you have a god name, you can really enjoy the powers of being a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said there were only 12 Annihilation God Spirits,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cIf I use the Sky God Crown, will I count as one of the 12? Will I have to go and guard the geno hall?\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou do not need to,\u201d God answered with certainty. \u201cDid I not tell you? You are not a real God Spirit. You do not take on the responsibilities of God Spirits.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew that God was not a liar, but he was still disappointed. If he could go to the geno hall, he would like to see what the interior of that place looked like.\n\nSeeing the empty god flag, Han Sen thought for a few moments and said, \u201cI will call myself the God of Wealth. I love that name, and it goes with my name Dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d God heard Han Sen\u2019s god title and laughed. He weirdly looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYour god name is very\u2026 Happy. It\u2019s not bad and very creative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, right? This title is great!\u201d Han Sen knew that God did not mean it, but he did not mind.\n\nThe front of the white god flag now had the word \u201cWealth\u201d on it. The back displayed the words \u201cGod of.\u201d The flag shone with a god light. It flew out of the god hall and stuck to the god temple\u2019s door. The moment the god flag went there, the Sky God Crown on Han Sen\u2019s head shone brightly. Many mysterious messages emerged from the Sky God Crown, which made him understand many things. \u201cI see it now\u2026\u201d Han Sen was feeling mysterious messages. He suddenly seemed to really understand what it was like to be a God Spirit. He was not clueless anymore.\n\nAside from what God said, the God Spirits had other powers. It was better than what Han Sen expected.\n\nGod Spirits earned the buffs of a god temple, and the buffs did not merely apply to immortality. There was a god power buff. The higher level the god temple was, the more god power he would receive.\n\nHan Sen had that Annihilation class god temple. It gave Han Sen god power buffs. It made his battle power increase another level.\n\nThat buff only worked in his god temple area. If he left the god temple, the god power buff would be gone.\n\nThere was also a special God Spirit authority. That special authority only belonged to God Spirits. Every God Spirit had its authority. Different god temples and different God Spirit powers and different authorities. Han Sen did not know what other powers God Spirits had. The God Spirit authority he received was called \u201cWealth.\u201d If any creature paid with their life span, Han Sen could bless them with some wealth and give them significant wealth for a short amount of time.\n\nOf course, God Spirit authorities could only be used when that person paid a sum of their years. The scarier thing was that the wealth Han Sen gave did not just come out from nowhere. It used the wealth that the person would have in the future.\n\nIf Han Sen gave someone more wealth than he earned in his life, very bad things would happen to that person."
