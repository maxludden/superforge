    "text": "Han Sen lifted his knife. There was no shiny knifelight, no spiritual glow, but the knifemind was so scary. It felt like a beast that had come to swallow the sky. It could not be avoided, and even space above would find itself fractured.\n\nAlthough it was a wrong feeling, it shocked everyone with awe. It was a feeling they couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen slashed towards the Tego Earl. He cut through his foe\u2019s armor and drew a deep cut across his chest. His Teeth power was buffed by his knifemind, and a purple mist began to envelop the wound, tearing it wider.\n\nSword Know\u2019s meteor-like swordlight and another Earl\u2019s spear came striking at the same time. Han Sen did not move, though. His Ghost Teeth Knife began whirling up another spiral. He caught the swordlight inside the circle, and then he threw it towards Rebecca to slow her down.\n\nAt the same time, Han Sen\u2019s left hand grabbed the red mist spring water. He put it in his mouth and swallowed it.\n\nAll these actions were performed in one uninterrupted sequence. It looked simple and smooth. So many Earls were attacking Han Sen, but he made it look like he was shooing off a bunch of kids.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Flower King\u2019s eyes were open wide as he stared at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t just generate a normal Teeth Knife knifemind. His knifemind was growing quickly, becoming something greater than usual. Even Flower King, who had lived for a thousand years, had not seen anything like this before.\n\nMoon Wheel King and Night River King looked at Han Sen, but remained speechless.\n\nThree months of a major gambit had been reduced to a joke. Han Sen had only taken one and a half months to develop a terrifying knifemind. The most talented Dukes had taken several years to make a remotely similar amount of progress.\n\nYisha\u2019s eyes looked bright as she watched. What she was thinking, though, you could not tell.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen cut Sword Know\u2019s arm off as he grabbed another glob of spring water and shoved it into his mouth.\n\nEverything was so seamless. If Sword Know and the others weren\u2019t the ones being subjected to this treatment, they\u2019d undoubtedly have praised the marvelous performance. All they could feel now, though, was shock.\n\nIt was unbelievable for a Baron to use sword skills like that, even if he was being slightly buffed by the treasures he used.\n\nHan Sen kept on fighting, swallowing the orbs of spring water as he went. He had consumed at least ten of them, and he used Yin Yang Change to convert them into power. His energy and Spell armor began to turn red and give off a strange mist. He looked so very weird.\n\nRebecca and the others did not want to retreat in such a state. They used all the power they could muster to fight Han Sen, but it meant naught. They still couldn\u2019t keep up, and they hadn\u2019t been able to claim a single drop of water for themselves. Han Sen had taken them all.\n\nThe storage capacity of that particular red mist spring was beyond anyone\u2019s wildest expectations. It was still releasing spring water.\n\n\u201cHuh, so what? Even if he does have tremendous skill, he has swallowed at least one hundred red mist spring water drops. Even if he was a bug, he should have been able to become a Viscount a few times over by now, but he hasn\u2019t yet leveled up. How does he expect to level up? I don\u2019t even think this guy will even be able to become a Duke,\u201d Night River King said, as he coldly looked upon Han Sen.\n\nBlack-Moon King sighed. He greatly favored Han Sen, but what Night River King said was true. Even a minuscule insect should have become a Viscount by now, but Han Sen had not. His ascendance required far too many resources.\n\nIf it was that difficult for him to become a Viscount, it would be even harder for him to level up and hit loftier tiers. Even if Yisha was willing to keep growing him, the chances of Han Sen ever becoming a King were super low.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame. To have such talent and yet be shackled with a geno art and body such as that.\u201d Moon Wheel King sighed. He felt very sorry for the lad.\n\nFlower King looked at Han Sen with admiration. He sighed and said, \u201cIt does not matter how good his skills are; if he cannot attain a higher level, it is all for naught. Thirteen spring water drops could create ten Viscounts. And yet, he has not leveled up. I don\u2019t think he will ever be a King.\u201d\n\nThe red mist inside Han Sen\u2019s body was getting thicker and thicker, and it was as if it was getting hacked at by blades. But his Spell armor remained quiet, and it wasn\u2019t releasing any energy at all.\n\nHan Sen kept fighting and drinking all the water he could grab. The spring continued to erupt and supply him with drops. Everyone thought each glob of water would be the last, but their expectations were shattered by the emergence of another\u2014each and every time.\n\nWhen Han Sen had swallowed seventeen or eighteen globs, the spring\u2019s eye began throwing out even more water.\n\n\u201cHow many xenogeneics were killed here in ancient times to produce such a large quantity of water beneath the surface?\u201d Black-Moon King said in wonder.\n\nNight River King\u2019s eyebrows kept on twitching. Han Sen had swallowed so much spring water, and he found himself having difficulty holding back. He had thought the spring water would have emptied by now, so he had held himself back each time.\n\nBut every time he thought of that, more water came out. Right now, the twentieth glob of spring water was emerging.\n\nNight River King was now full of regret. He regretted not making a move of his own any sooner. He could have grabbed at least ten water drops. Now, all of the spring water was inside Han Sen\u2019s belly, and he could not even produce a fart. It was a waste of a rare material.\n\nWhen the spring erupted again, Night River King finally couldn\u2019t keep himself restrained. He did not care if there was any more spring water coming or not; he was going to make a move. If he didn\u2019t, he believed his heart would be buried by dust\u2014and that would affect his training.\n\nMoon Wheel King and the others were shocked. If a red mist spring produced one hundred water drops, it was considered very large. This spring had produced almost two hundred, and it was still going.\n\nThe scariest thing was that Han Sen had swallowed so much of that water, and yet he had not become a Viscount.\n\nSword Know\u2019s eyebrows jumped, as if he had just heard something. His face changed, but he decided to spit out some blood and jump towards Han Sen like a bloody arrow.\n\nHan Sen slashed towards the blood arrow and cut it open. But inside the blood arrow was a red bug which continued flying towards Han Sen. It was so small and so fast that it hit Han Sen\u2019s forehead, even with his Spell helmet on.\n\nAs this occurred, the spring\u2019s eye was shining bright. A red light came out of the red spring, but this time, it was not water. It was a red soul.\n\n\u201cThe red mist soul!\u201d All the Kings screamed.\n\nBut before they could do anything, Han Sen grabbed the soul and swallowed it."
