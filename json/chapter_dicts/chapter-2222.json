He slashed as quickly as he could, but the lava peacock was still able to avoid each strike.\n\n\u201cI do not believe I cannot kill you!\u201d Han Sen dodged the lava peacock\u2019s squirting of lava and thrust his Ghost Teeth Knife forward, firing a knife silk at the lava peacock, but the peacock managed to dodge the knife silk net easily, and it did not even come into contact with its body.\n\nHan Sen put his Ghost Teeth Knife away and drew his Spell pistols instead. He fired at the peacock like mad, but the gold peacock was able to dodge each bullet, leaving a trail of gold dust in its wake. No matter how Han Sen tried to attack the peacock, he couldn\u2019t hit it.\n\nWhile the lava peacock fought Han Sen, Han Meng\u2019er pulled the string of her bow and fired an arrow.\n\nThe peacock dodged Han Sen\u2019s pistol attacks, but as it did so, it put itself into a more difficult position. Han Meng\u2019er\u2019s arrow was on a collision course with the peacock as a result, but all of a sudden, the peacock flapped its wings. It made a strange curvature in the fabric of space as if to twist the dimension. By doing so, it managed to evade Han Meng\u2019er\u2019s arrow.\n\n\u201cSo strong!\u201d Han Sen was surprised, but Han Meng\u2019er just frowned.\n\nBzzt!\n\nHuangfu Jing teleported her body behind the lava peacock and readied herself to throw a punch into its back, but the peacock waved its feathers and dodged her attack, too.\n\nJi Qing was clutching her Duke class Galactic Shrimp sword. She swung a few swordlights at the peacock, but it was able to dodge them, too.\n\nHan Sen and the others were all fighting the lava peacock together, but none of them were able to brush or ruffle a single hair of the creature. The peacock was like a flame that kept changing in the dance of its ripples. It kept flying around in a twisted way through the distortion of space. The lava lashed about all over the place, prompting Han Sen to fall back a touch.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen and Huangfu Jing battered their Jade Drum, and it sent two strong sonic shockwaves out. It hit the lava peacock, but it just made the lava hotter. The shockwave only managed to knock back some of the lava splashes. After all, it was only a Duke class Jade Drum. Its sonic powers would not be enough to damage the mutant Duke beast.\n\n\u201cLet me do it!\u201d Han Yan shouted. She was holding a Marquise Galactic Shrimp Sword. Her body gleamed with a white light, and her hair became long. She looked as if there were a god looking directly after her.\n\nHan Yan slashed at the lava peacock, unleashing an invisible swordlight. At the same time as this, the peacock\u2019s body was hit. It made it spill more lava.\n\nThe Falsified-Sky Sutra worked to deliver an absolute hit as it ought to have. Han Sen and the others could not follow and keep up with the insane speed of the lava peacock, and while Han Yan couldn\u2019t either, she didn\u2019t have to. When the swordlight was unleashed, it would assuredly strike the peacock.\n\nHan Yan kept swinging her sword, making many invisible swordlights come raging at the lava peacock for surefire hits. The lava it carried kept squirting around.\n\nBut while she was indeed delivering hits, her strikes were not very effective. After all, Han Yan was only an Earl. Even though she had a super god body and her Falsified-Sky Sutra equipped, going up against a Duke, it would still never be enough.\n\n\u201cZero!\u201d Han Sen, upon seeing the Falsified-Sky Sutra prove effective, thought about Zero. She was a Marquise, and she possessed the same power.\n\nZero heard Han Sen\u2019s command and used her purple eyes and drew out the Bone Knife. That lava peacock wished to melt the Bone Knife by firing a stream of lava at it, but then the Bone Knife disappeared. When it reappeared, it was pierced into the peacock\u2019s chest.\n\nBlergh!\n\nThe peacock coughed up a bucket of blood that looked like lava. This time, their foe had been injured. Zero\u2019s body then took off flying into the sky in a nifty retrieval of her Bone Knife. She flew down past the peacock that wished to now leap into the lava and heal, and sliced open the creature\u2019s chest. A burning flame with gold blood began to spill out from the lesion. It made the peacock freeze in its spot in the air.\n\nHan Sen kept firing at the heavily injured lava peacock. Every single bullet struck its body, and the powers of Break Six Skies were unloaded. It resulted in the peacock being blown to bits.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke hunted. Gold Fire Peacock: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Gold Fire Peacock beast soul.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He did not expect to kill the Gold Fire Peacock as quickly as that. It was not a mutant xenogeneic, and while it was revealed to be just an ordinary Duke, it was certainly fast.\n\nHan Sen, hearing that he had obtained a beast soul, was very happy. He quickly had a look at what sort of beast soul it was.\n\nDuke class beast soul Gold Fire Peacock: Flying-type.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart stopped. A gold lava-looking set of peacock wings appeared behind Han Sen. A slight touch could make Han Sen travel so far and so fast. Whenever he sped up, he could unleash a stream of fire that could twist the fabric of space in its vicinity.\n\n\u201cA flying beast soul is good, but I already have my dragon wings. I do not need this beast soul.\u201d Han Sen let out a sigh, and then he gave the Gold Fire Peacock beast soul to Han Yan. Because she was only an Earl, her safety could be more easily assured with the Gold Fire Peacock beast soul.\n\nHan Sen kept looking for more creatures to hunt, and although he had managed to collect a few fire element bird beast souls, none were of the weapon type he so much desired.\n\n\u201cAre fire weapon beast souls that difficult to procure?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. Lava Valley had many fire bird xenogeneics. He knew what kind of beast soul they would offer, but none were his desired weapon.\n\nIt was almost time for him to go back, so Han Sen decided to retreat. He returned to the base, hoping to go further next time and see what he could get then.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, it is good that you have returned! Your team will be the recipient of a new addition.\u201d After returning to base, Han Sen was called over by Ice Blue Knight King.\n\n\u201cDid we not have an agreement saying you can\u2019t take anyone away?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cOf course I remember. We are not taking your people away. You didn\u2019t say we could not add members to your team, though. I have good faith in you, and so I have found your team a powerful ally that will benefit you and the others.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King smiled while he spoke.\n\n\u201cCan I reject the addition?\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cNo, this is an order.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King spoke with absolute certainty.\n\nWhile Han Sen wished to say something more, a woman arrived. She walked in front of Ice Blue Knight King, bowed, and said, \u201cMister Knight, greetings from Bai Wei.\u201d\n\nHan Sen, upon seeing the woman, was given a shock. That was the Extreme King woman he had encountered in Narrow Moon. Han Sen had stolen the Destroyed Bible from her."
