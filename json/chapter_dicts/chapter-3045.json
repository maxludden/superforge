    "text": "Who would have suspected that Han Sen\u2019s reaction would end up surprising Mister Yang? He was not angry. He actually laughed.\n\nHan Sen pointed at the overbearing bug and asked, \u201cI don\u2019t need to be your servant, but if I kill it, can I have its body?\u201d\n\nAfter that, he looked at Mister Yang and asked, \u201cOld Yang, can that gene race be food for Small Cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it could be\u2026\u201d Mister Yang\u2019s expression looked weird. Using a king-class gene race to feed a newborn gene race seemed excessive. While it was possible, it might end up just being a waste. \u201cOf course, you can.\u201d The white-clothed young man hastily nodded.\n\nPeaceful looked awfully glum. She wished to protest, but all she could really do was mumble under her breath and not say anything audibly.\n\nThe white-clothed young man looked at Peaceful and rushed her to get started. \u201cPeaceful, hurry up and get your overbearing bug to attack him. I want to see if he can really kill the overbearing bug with his bare hands.\u201d\n\nPeaceful\u2019s eyes twitched. She seemed to be struggling with the request. In the end, she adhered to what the young man in white clothes told her. She commanded the overbearing bug to attack Han Sen.\n\nThis overbearing bug was different from Shibo\u2019s overbearing bug. Its carapace was black, but it had a golden sheen. Its power and speed were far greater than Shibo\u2019s overbearing bug.\n\n\u201cDo you want to use my overbearing bug as cat food? You can go to hell!\u201d Peaceful was secretly furious. She hoped the overbearing bug could swallow Han Sen in one gulp.\n\nThe overbearing bug\u2019s body was very big, but its speed was quite scary. It was just like a flea. Its body became blurry a little as it teleported in front of Han Sen.\n\nIts mouth was full of long teeth that were going to try swallowing Han Sen, but Han Sen raised his arm high and threw a punch down.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe overbearing bug\u2019s head was punched into the ground. Brain juice went everywhere. It was murdered outright.\n\nPeaceful\u2019s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Before, Han Sen had been able to punch a juvenile overbearing bug, but her overbearing bug was an adult. Still, Han Sen was able to obliterate its brain. It was extremely hard to believe.\n\nThe white-clothed young man was astounded as he watched from nearby. He clapped and said, \u201cVery interesting. You can really kill an overbearing bug with your bare hands. How are you so strong?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the young man and asked, \u201cWill you uphold your promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Peaceful, give him the body of your overbearing bug.\u201d The white-clothed young man walked over to Han Sen. As he walked, he asked, \u201cYour name is Han Sen, right? Were you born with a Blood-Pulse? If so, what Blood-Pulse do you have? How can you be so powerful?\u201d\n\nAfter that, the young man in white clothes reached out his hands to touch Han Sen\u2019s muscles. He looked curious as he did so.\n\n\u201cMister\u2026 No\u2026\u201d The white-clothed young man had yet to touch Han Sen when a shadow appeared in front of him. He could not get close to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDid I not request that you guys not follow me? Why are you here?\u201d The young man in white clothes did not look happy. He madly looked at that person.\n\n\u201cMy bad.\u201d The man kneeled before the young man, but it did not look as if he was going to budge. He lowered his head and said, \u201cThis person is too dangerous. Please, do not put yourself at risk.\u201d\n\nThe white-clothed young man coldly shouted, \u201cI just wanted to talk to him! Why would it be dangerous? Go back now!\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, please just think about it.\u201d The man remained in front of the young man as if he was not going to leave.\n\n\u201cI am taking the overbearing bug.\u201d Han Sen sensed that the white-clothed young man was someone special, but that did not matter to him. He waved at the white-clothed young man and walked over to the overbearing bug. He picked up its body and planned to leave.\n\n\u201cAnnoying asshole! Get out of my way.\u201d The young man in white clothes looked very irritated. He kicked the kneeling man out of the way and walked over to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, if you are willing to return with me, I can promise you great wealth,\u201d the young man in white clothes passionately said.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want me to come with you so badly?\u201d Han Sen asked as he continued to walk.\n\n\u201cMy big sister has a very powerful gene race,\u201d the white-clothed man said as he gritted his teeth. \u201cI keep losing and end up getting bullied by her. I want you to help me beat her gene race so I can exact my revenge.\u201d\n\nHan Sen rolled his eyes. \u201cI am human. I am not a gene race.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but there are no rules suggesting humans cannot compete in an arena,\u201d the young man seriously said.\n\n\u201cI am not going,\u201d Han Sen said. He didn\u2019t even turn around to look at the young man as he spoke.\n\n\u201cI thought you wanted the bodies of gene races,\u201d the white-clothed young man quickly said. \u201cIf you can kill my big sister\u2019s gene race, you can have the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot interested.\u201d Han Sen did not even think twice about rejecting the offer. He did not really need gene races.\n\n\u201cI will give you 10 gene eggs\u2026 No\u2026 I will give you 20\u2026\u201d The young man kept making offers. He looked as if he was not going to give up.\n\nHan Sen kept ignoring him and continued walking away.\n\nThe white-clothed young man did not want to give up. He kept following Han Sen, trying to convince him.\n\nPeaceful and the guard were following the young man. They were on alert. They stared at Han Sen. They were afraid Han Sen might do something bad to the young man.\n\nHan Sen was getting annoyed by the young man. He pointed to Peaceful and casually said, \u201cFine, if you want me to go to that arena, then make her become my slave.\u201d\n\nPeaceful was furious and asked, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing this, the young man looked very happy. He looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cDo you mean it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am serious,\u201d Han Sen said with a laugh. \u201cPeaceful, do that for me,\u201d the young man in white clothes said to Peaceful.\n\nThe expressions on Han Sen and Peaceful immediately changed. Han Sen thought, \u201cJesus Christ, what kind of landlord\u2019s stupid son is this? He really agreed.\u201d\n\nPeaceful was the granddaughter of Dragon Song City\u2019s leader. Ordinary people would not have agreed with Han Sen\u2019s condition. Even Big Qin Kingdom\u2019s king would not have humiliated his children\u2019s subordinates.\n\nYet, the white-clothed young man had immediately agreed to give Peaceful to Han Sen as a slave. How stupid was he to say something like that?\n\nPeaceful kneeled and said with simmering anger, \u201cMister\u2026 Please grant me death\u2026\u201d\n\nEven the guard looked at the white-clothed young man strangely, but he held his tongue.\n\nUpon hearing Peaceful wanted to die, the white-clothed young man froze. He wished to say something more, but the guard suddenly shouted, \u201cCareful, Mister!\u201d\n\nAfter that, the guard\u2019s body shone with a strange light. Wings appeared on his back, and strange horns were on his head. He threw a punch into the sky.\n\nA bolt of lightning came down from the sky. It burned the guard into a crisp. He fell to the ground and died.\n\nHan Sen turned around. He saw a beautiful woman with white wings wearing a white dress come forth with lightning crackling around her. She descended from the sky like a wrathful angel."
