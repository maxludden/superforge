And who is Godslayer Luo, anyway?\u201d Dragon King asked, with widened eyes.\n\n\u201cHe was a human who slaughtered a bunch of spirits in this place,\u201d Han Sen explained succinctly.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? How could he have triggered the ire of so many emperors if all he did was go about killing and conquering, very much like what you have done?\u201d Dragon King thought it was quite strange.\n\nHan Sen admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know the full story behind it, I\u2019ll be honest. But to make so many spirits and emperors hate him, he must have done something far worse than kill a bunch of pompous spirits. This is unusual, I\u2019ll confess.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Dragon King did not believe he was hearing the truth. That wasn\u2019t to say he believed Han Sen was lying, mind.\n\nHan Sen then slowly started to say, \u201cI have heard that Godslayer Luo wields the power of Asura.\u201d\n\n\u201cPah! Don\u2019t feed me that cowpat. I\u2019m the only person in existence who knows the true power of Asura,\u201d Dragon King said, with confidence.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it the Asura Sutra? And you\u2019re the sole one? How can you know, but not the other generals?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThe Asura Sutra is\u2026\u201d Dragon King\u2019s talk suddenly trailed off. When he resumed his speech, he said, \u201cHow dare you! Stop trying to trick me into telling you. This Godslayer chap couldn\u2019t have the power of Asura, because he isn\u2019t Asura.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Asura Sutra isn\u2019t even that good. Zero learned it, and all she did was go a little hyper and kill a spirit. That\u2019s what has prompted all the other emperors to take up arms and go after her. It\u2019s a little too much of a coincidence, though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Han Sen explained further.\n\n\u201cBut humans are unable to learn the Asura Sutra,\u201d Dragon King said, resolutely.\n\nHan Sen then went to find Zero and bring her before Dragon King so she could demonstrate the Asura powers she could wield.\n\n\u201cImpossible! Impossible. Impossible! Impossible. Impossible! How are humans able to practice the Asura Sutra?! Impossible. Impossible! Impossible,\u201d Dragon King repeated, as if the shock had thrown him into a daze.\n\n\u201cGodslayer Luo\u2019s Falsified-Sky Sutra is practically the same as the Asura Sutra,\u201d Han Sen told him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking crap.\u201d Dragon King refused to believe what he was hearing.\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cI have a blood relation with Godslayer Luo; I am the true heir. It isn\u2019t Zero. And I have read the Falsified-Sky Sutra and I can confirm, 100%, they are one and the same.\u201d\n\nDragon King didn\u2019t even say anything in response to this claim.\n\nSo, Han Sen spoke again, telling him, \u201cMy sister has practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra, and I have seen her use it in action. The powers are the same, and now, I have a personal stake in all this trouble. The last thing I want, when she comes here to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, is for her to suffer what I am about to go through. I don\u2019t want emperors looking to bully her because of a skill she possesses.\u201d\n\nDragon King appeared to be conflicted, but shock was the prevailing emotion. And he was feeling so much shock, he could hardly speak.\n\nHan Sen went on to say, \u201cIn the Alliance, there is another race of beings. They aren\u2019t human, and they are whom we call shura. The Falsified-Sky Sutra was retrieved from a tomb belonging to one of their perished kings.\u201d\n\nDragon King finally responded, and he asked, \u201cWhat do they look like? These\u2026 shura?\u201d\n\nHan Sen described their appearance, and Dragon King\u2019s face distorted.\n\n\u201cCan you tell me if there is a relation between the shura and this stuff?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King told Han Sen, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t help me find a solution to this problem of ours, it\u2019s us versus the rest of the sanctuary. We\u2019re both in the same boat here,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King nibbled his lips before talking again. \u201cOkay, tell me what you want to know. Personally, I don\u2019t think anything I tell you will be of any service, but if peace of mind is enough, then I am here for your elucidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what you can, then,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDragon King sighed and said, \u201cFine. Even if didn\u2019t tell you, the truth would have to come out eventually.\u201d\n\nDragon King went quiet for a while, as if he was composing what he was about to say. Then, after a period of silence elapsed, he said, \u201cYou were right. Mister Ancient Devil summoned a demi-god with a Demi-God Geno Core, but you were wrong in the suggestion that he used us as the sacrifice. He was able to summon the super creatures and spirits necessary, but that aside, he required my help.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp?\u201d Han Sen did not understand what help Dragon King could provide, or if the summoning of a demi-god even required help when he was able to do it so simply.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cI told you that demi-gods will help you after being summoned. But, as with all things, it depends on their mood on that particular day. And what\u2019s more, Ancient Devil Emperor did not summon a demi-god for aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he want, then?\u201d Han Sen had a guess in mind, but he still wanted to ask for confirmation.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cHe wanted to kill the demi-god and take the core for himself.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was able to guess this, but still, hearing that was what Ancient Devil Emperor wished to do was rather unnerving to hear.\n\n\u201cAnd what happened then? Did he succeed?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Dragon King paused, and then went on to say, \u201cWell, success is all relative.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cMister Ancient Devil did trick the demi-god, but it wasn\u2019t him who killed the summoned one. And it wasn\u2019t him who took the core,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\n\u201cAsura?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\n\u201cYes. He killed the demi-god and took the Demi-God Geno Core. That was what formed the basis of the betrayal incident you have long pestered me about.\u201d"
