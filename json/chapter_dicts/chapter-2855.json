After a while, the new Sky Vine Radish was done.\n\nCompared to the shell before, the Sky Vine Radish with a god personality had a massively frightening lifeforce. That powerful feeling was like when Han Sen had first encountered King Jun. Although King Jun had given him this feeling, it was rather different.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d God looked at the reborn Sky Vine Radish with surprise. It seemed as if he had discovered something quite interesting about it.\n\nHan Sen turned and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSky Vine Radish seems to have some sort of problem,\u201d God said with a frown. He had been looking at Sky Vine Radish\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He seemed to have thought of something.\n\n\u201cInside his body\u2026 His spirit is gone\u2026\u201d God stared at the reborn Sky Vine Radish. He sounded weird as he spoke.\n\n\u201cSpirit?\u201d Han Sen asked. \u201cAre you referring to the same sort of spirits that the Nine-Defense Palace xenogeneics are also missing?\u201d\n\nGod nodded. \u201cYes, it\u2019s the same. Previously, I told you that the spirit is an uncertain part of a creature\u2019s gene. That description is not so accurate. In fact, I do not know how to describe what this is because the existence of a spirit is very abstract.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me give you an example,\u201d God said. \u201cA father and mother determine genetic genes. Even if the father and mother end up having twins, the genes of the two babies are not the same. As they grow up, their personalities and bodies develop and mature differently. That is the result of one\u2019s spirit.\u201d\n\nHan Sen hesitated and said, \u201cThe genes of a twin are different. That is normal, right?\u201d He did not understand what a spirit was.\n\nGod thought for a moment and said, \u201cPerhaps that example was not appropriate. You should know gene duplicated creatures, right? In theory, gene duplicated creatures should be the same as the original gene creature. They would have the same personality. In fact, if you let those gene duplicated creatures grow freely and quickly, their shapes and bodies have different features. Even their personalities would. That depends on the spirit.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that, Han Sen, looked like he understood it, but he did not understand it. This was not a question that could be answered through words. There were no standard words to describe it.\n\nGod knew full-well that Han Sen was still failing to understand. He pointed at the newly reborn Sky Vine Radish and said, \u201cJust like Sky Vine Radish, the reborn Sky Vine Radish should have the same spirit as before. That means this reborn Sky Vine Radish is a continuous life hailing from the previous Sky Vine Radish. But now, the reborn Sky Vine Radish has no spirit. That means he is just a replica of Sky Vine Radish\u2019s genes. The body is the same, but in some way, he is not the same Sky Vine Radish as before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d Han Sen seemed to understand a little. His heart understood something.\n\n\u201cTo you, the biggest difference should be the fact that he will not remember you were the one that murdered him before his rebirth here,\u201d God said. \u201cEven if he found out, he would not care. Without the last spirit, he will not know what happened to Sky Vine Radish in the past and associate events of the previous Sky Vine Radish with himself. He will not care.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard that, he was happy. \u201cThat means not having a spirit is good. Does that mean he will not have a spirit ever again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of god is one without a spirit? A creature should always have a spirit, but the spirit should not be the same as before. So, the spirit is different from the last one.\u201d God looked at Sky Vine Radish as he spoke.\n\nBy now, the green light on the altar was gone. Sky Vine Radish had finished being reborn. He was like a god standing upon the altar. He was slowly opening his eyes.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cEven if Sky Vine Radish does not remember the past, he would not forgive some creature for entering his temple so boldly.\u201d Unexpectedly Sky Vine Radish\u2019s vision went right past Han Sen and landed on God.\n\nHan Sen opened his mouth. He could not believe that had happened.\n\nSky Vine Radish had a giant-like body, yet he suddenly jumped better than a rabbit could. His giant body landed on the floor with outstretched hands. He was kneeling in profuse worship. He placed his head on the floor as he shivered and shook.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Although he thought God was stronger than Sky Vine Radish, he did not expect that only a glimpse of God was enough to make him behave so fearfully. He was more frightened than a mouse encountering a cat.\n\nAt least, if a mouse saw a cat, it could run. Now, Sky Vine Radish appeared as such. He could not even run. He had to kneel on the ground shaking.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. It is almost time. There are a few more matches I would like to watch.\u201d God ignored Sky Vine Radish. He stretched and walked out of the temple.\n\nHan Sen looked at the kneeling Sky Vine Radish, who did not dare raise his head. He left the Sky Vine Radish temple with God.\n\nAfter exiting the temple, Han Sen looked back a few times. While he was still able to see the temple, he saw that Sky Vine Radish was still scared and unable to move. He did not get up.\n\nWhen he walked the last stone step, Han Sen\u2019s environment changed. He was back inside Nine-Defense Palace.\n\n\u201cI did what you wanted me to do. In the next round, you must win the fight. I have faith in you.\u201d God smiled at Han Sen as he spoke.\n\n\u201cYes, I have faith in myself too.\u201d Han Sen rubbed his nose.\n\nGod went back to the garden. Han Sen stayed where he was, using the excuse that he was going to kill more xenogeneics. After watching God leave, Han Sen looked into his Sea of Soul. He examined Sky Vine Radish\u2019s god spirit.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cDoes this mean god spirits are the spirits God mentioned? Because the god spirit was taken, Sky Vine Radish spawned with no god spirit. So, will there be a new spirit getting born? In that case, are beast souls their spirits? Is it just the spirits of a low-level creature?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut hang on\u2026 God said the xenogeneics in Nine-Defense Palace had no spirits. Where did their spirits go? How did the kings of the Extreme King take their souls away? If beast souls really are their spirits, how are humans able to kill xenogeneics and take their spirits away? Even the god spirits were pulled away.\u201d Han Sen thought of a lot. He had the willies just thinking about it.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had a hold on something, but he had too little information to figure it all out. It was like he had seen a shadow through paper, but he could not see the figure.\n\n\u201cIt looks like everything must wait until I become true god class. I need to get into the geno hall to figure out everything.\u201d Han Sen sighed. He shelved his thoughts on the matter. He knew over-thinking was not good for him. Increasing his power was the top priority.\n\n\u201cI wonder what power this Sky Vine Radish God Lance has.\u201d Han Sen tried putting the Sky Radish Vine God Lance inside his Sea of Soul, and it worked. The lance was like a beast soul. Han Sen put it in his Sea of Soul. As Han Sen soon as thought of it, the Sky Vine Radish God Lance appeared in his hands.\n\n\u201cSo, can god personality armaments be placed inside the Sea of Soul?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s expression looked complicated."
