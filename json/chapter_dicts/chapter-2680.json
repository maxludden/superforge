    "text": "The two of them continued fighting, but they were unable to deal damage to each other.\n\nHan Sen kept altering his knife skills. Shale\u2019s punching skill didn\u2019t change in the face of Han Sen\u2019s rapidly mutating attacks. The two of them fought as hard and fast as they could, but neither of them could gain the upper hand.\n\nIt had been a very long time since Han Sen had a fight like this. In his recent fights, he had either lost to his enemies or crushed them almost immediately. He hadn\u2019t put so much energy and effort into a fight since his contest with Lone Bamboo.\n\nA fight like this drained a lot of energy from his body. It also forced him to use his mind constantly. If he made a mistake, his enemy would take advantage of the window and beat him. He couldn\u2019t afford to make a single misstep.\n\nAs the Very High watched the pair conduct their battle, conflicted looks appeared across their faces. Both of the fighters were King class, but their minds were deified. The fight was so nuanced that the onlookers didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\n\nThis was no ordinary battle. This fight took effort and brainpower. Many of the attacks and counters seemed simple, until the audience took a second to consider why the two fighters had chosen those moves. Every single action in this fight was done with an ulterior motive.\n\nIt looked like a simple fist and knife fight, but people would be thinking about it for a long time afterward.\n\nLiyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng\u2019s bodies were quivering. It was hard to tell who was going to win and who would lose. It looked as if winning or losing would only come from a hair-thin lead.\n\n\u201cBig Brother, having Shale as your silkworm is very fortuitous for you.\u201d Bixi looked at his big brother Li Chun Qiu with grand admiration.\n\n\u201cYu Shanxin isn\u2019t bad, either,\u201d Li Chun Qiu said distantly. Since Shale was his silkworm, he wasn\u2019t really paying much attention to their conversation. He felt as if he was fighting Han Sen himself, right then and there. But there were many fighting minds and techniques he had to learn that he had never previously encountered. It felt so strange.\n\nExperiencing the battle from Shale\u2019s perspective was unique. He felt like he was fighting himself, but at the same time, he could step back and examine Shale\u2019s choices with a critical eye. He could tell which decisions Shale made were better than his opponent and vice versa. He only absorbed the good battle experiences, while figuring out and filing away the bad ones.\n\nRight now, Shale was only half-deified. In the future, Shale would travel through the deified ranks of primitive, transmutation, larva, butterfly, and maybe even true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly absorb everything that Shale experienced.\n\nAt that point, Li Chun Qiu would only be half-deified. But he would have the experience of a true god. Li Chun Qiu could slowly study everything that Shale had learned through his evolution. Although he would only be half-deified himself, his mind would be on a different level.\n\nBixi looked bitter as he said, \u201cThis Yu Shanxin hides a great deal from me. He is so strong and tough. He is a difficult nut to crack. Even now, I have yet to learn a single thing from his mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose silkworms might be the most challenging, but they\u2019re also the most rewarding. Conquering them will yield better results in the long run,\u201d Li Chun Qiu said.\n\n\u201cYou are right, but\u2026 Well, never mind. I bet Exquisite and Li Keer have the same problem\u2026\u201d Bixi said.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer did have trouble, but Han Sen let them in when he fought. Like Li Chun Qiu, they gained a lot of battle experience from Han Sen. Each decision he made taught them a lot.\n\nBut while Han Sen was a ninth-tier King, he had a scary power and a scarier mind. It made them so happy. Even if Han Sen lost this fight, just getting to experience this battle would be more than worth it to them.\n\nOne thing caught them off guard, though. Despite the intensity of the fight, they could sense that Han Sen was deliberately hiding the true range of his powers.\n\n\u201cIs Han Sen not using all of his strength?\u201d The possibility stunned them. He was already fighting at an unbelievable level, and yet he didn\u2019t seem to have tapped into the full potential of his power. That was a scary thought.\n\nLi Keer had always thought Dollar was stronger than Han Sen, but she now found herself looking at the man with a complicated expression.\n\nAlthough he was fighting an elite like Shale, Han Sen could still hide some of his power. This was no longer just an intimidating display of ability; it was out-and-out frightening.\n\nAlthough Han Sen tried his best to close off his mind and avoid thinking about the Dongxuan Sutra and his super god spirit body, Li Keer and Exquisite were still able to pick up that he was suppressing something. They would come to know that Han Sen was hiding his true power, but that couldn\u2019t be avoided.\n\nIn truth, Han Sen\u2019s ability to suppress his thoughts at all in this situation indicated that the power of his mind was terrifyingly profound. In a fight like that, most people would need to constantly think about which geno arts and powers they were good at.\n\n\u201cThis guy is too scary\u2026\u201d Li Keer said while she watched Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHe is rather frightening, isn\u2019t he? I don\u2019t think he will ever fail to surprise us. Every time we think we have seen it all, he goes the extra mile and does more,\u201d Exquisite said with a nervous smile.\n\nWhen she fought Han Sen, she thought that she had forced him to cast many of his skills. But it now looked like Han Sen had only used a fraction of his talent when he was fighting her. He was now bringing out more tools, but even more were still being kept hidden.\n\n\u201cWe must dig into this man and unearth all of his secrets,\u201d Li Keer said. Her eyes were brimming with excitement.\n\nLi Keer had better potential than Exquisite, but she didn\u2019t focus on the Very High Sense. Her Very High Forget Love wasn\u2019t as developed as Exquisite\u2019s, so she was prone to becoming more emotional.\n\nExquisite only coldly said, \u201cThere is no rush. We have four years. He will reveal his secrets to us in time. It doesn\u2019t matter that he has managed to hide it all for now.\u201dOpen Sky Elder looked a bit gloomy, and he said, \u201cThe smallest move could determine how this plays out. Either one of them could win at this point. Han Sen is strong, but he is just a ninth-tier King. He is ranked lower than Shale. If they were in the same class, Han Sen would have a seventy percent chance of winning.\u201d\n\nQiyu Elder shook his head and said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Shale is half-deified, but his will is deified. Han Sen is just a ninth-tier King, and yet, he is holding his own against a powerful half-deified. That means his talent and potential are scarier than Shale\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the eleven armor talent test was legit?\u201d Open Sky Elder wondered with a frown.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say. If he isn\u2019t doing this well because of his talent, then it is hard to imagine what Han Sen has that is letting him fight Shale.\u201d Qiyu Elder looked at Han Sen, his face conflicted.\n\n\u201cA ten armor talent is very rare. A real eleven armor talent would make a man the greatest of his generation. Do you think Han Sen is this kind of great man?\u201d Open Sky Elder asked, looking a little worried.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that, but it is plain to see that his talent is stunning. Li Keer and Exquisite got lucky when they signed a contract with him,\u201d Qiyu Elder said.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on\u2026 Something is wrong with Shale!\u201d Open Sky Elder wanted to say something, but he was in too much shock. Then, his face went white. He looked at Shale in the video and screamed, \u201cHe\u2026 He\u2019s going to level up!\u201d"
