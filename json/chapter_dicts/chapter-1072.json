The tree itself was simply named \u2018Devil.\u2019 If it bore fruit, it would have been able to create demonic dimensions. Unfortunately for Ancient Devil Emperor, he was unable to find success in this venture.\u201d\n\nDragon King paused briefly before resuming his speech. He took a deep breath and explained, \u201cThis Devil tree was destroyed during the war, but the wood of the tree splintered to form little Devil Orbs. When destroyed, these Devil Orbs contain the power to transport others to this Devil\u2019s Realm.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was disappointed, learning the orbs were a one-way ticket.\n\nAgain, though, he heard the distant sound of a baby crying. It was exactly the same as what he had heard earlier.\n\nDragon King also heard the noise, and he told Han Sen, \u201cDevil Fangs have found us. They remain in a constant shift of mutations. They could be super creatures; we should go!\u201d\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cGo where? Can we reach the shelter that is high above?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not; that is where the super creatures reside. Who knows how strong they have become?\u201d Dragon King preached.\n\n\u201cThen where in the sanctuaries can I go?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King did not know where they could go, either. There were cracks everywhere in the fabric of this dimension. They couldn\u2019t just flee senselessly.\n\nWhen a dimension gets distorted or twisted or broken, going in one direction could leave you going in another.\n\nDragon King caught sight of a Devil Fang racing out from the black mist, but much to Han Sen\u2019s relief, he was able to gauge its strength as being only sacred-blood in class.\n\nSuddenly, a dozen more raced out of the black. Their ravenous, hungry maws snapped towards Han Sen.\n\nDragon King swiftly returned to his ring, but he couldn\u2019t be faulted for this. He really was in a state of weakness, and he\u2019d have been unable to deal with a single one of the fiends, most likely.\n\nHan Sen drew Taia and Phoenix Sword and remained as fearless as ever. With Bao\u2019er and the bird atop his shoulders, he ran forward to greet the monsters.\n\nWhen a sword cleaved its way through a Devil Fang, green blood gushed from the fleshy crevices. Using Double Fly, Han Sen was able to effortlessly slay four of them. The rest weren\u2019t waiting around, though\u2014they were still coming.\n\nEven when Han Sen hewed the limbs of the creatures off, they still wriggled their way forward for a taste of his fresh meat.\n\nGreen blood started to form a pool around Han Sen, and the level rose the more he killed.\n\nAfter killing a dozen of the Devil Fangs, their numbers were replenished with a greater sum that lurked in the darkness out of sight. Now, another fifty sought a taste of the human.\n\nBut Han Sen was unfazed. He carried on fighting as his clothes became drenched with the green blood. Even Bao\u2019er\u2019s face had been splashed with the stuff, which made her quite angry.\n\nNot happy with the constant soaking, Bao\u2019er brought out her mini-gourd and pointed it towards the monsters.\n\nThe group of Devil Fangs that remained were immediately frightened by its power of suction, and they tried their best to scramble away to safety.\n\nBut it was useless, and they were each and all sucked into the gourd.\n\nA few dozen Devil Fangs were sucked into the gourd in nearly an instant. Others that were thinking of taking their fallen brethren\u2019s places now had second thoughts, and they elected to stay away.\n\nHan Sen was delighted, as it had been a while since he had received Bao\u2019er\u2019s support. He kissed her and said, \u201cGood job! You make daddy proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am good,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, with a smug grin.\n\n\u201cYou are the best.\u201d Han Sen looked to the Devil Fangs he himself killed. Then, he got a fire going so he could cook them.\n\nHan Sen was starving after all the fighting, so now was a good time to cook and eat. While he ate, he could also mull his predicament and figure out how he might leave the realm.\n\nDevil Fangs were ugly, but the meat appeared similar to beef. So, they at least looked tasty. Han Sen cooked it to the accompaniment of a mouth-watering sizzle.\n\nBao\u2019er sat down near the fire, watching as the meat slowly roasted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be done in a sec.\u201d Han Sen wielded his makeshift cookery like an artisan. He seared the meat perfectly, and a tantalizing aroma rose under his expert hands.\n\nHe brought out a crate of salts and spices. With a sprinkle here and there, the energizing scent deepened, and it got their tongues wagging for a taste.\n\n\u201cDevil Fang meat consumed. Sacred Geno Points +1.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen took a bite, he heard the announcement and was happy. He looked over to Bao\u2019er and the bird, and saw them nibbling and pecking with delight at a portion of the meat.\n\nAfter eating a slab of the meat, Han Sen was full. But Bao\u2019er and the bird were able to consume five slabs.\n\nDevil Fangs continued to howl, out somewhere in the darkness. They were too afraid to come any closer, but still, Han Sen thought it was rather strange for him and his companions to dine comfortably with danger not too far away.\n\nHe had managed to get four sacred geno points from the meal, which placed him at the number seventy. Soon, he believed, he\u2019d max out the tally in full.\n\n\u201cThis might end up working out, after all. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a lucky thing, for me to end up here. This realm is full of easy kills, and if my good fortune holds out, I might even be able to slay a super creature, too. Heaven knows I need more of those geno points,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nThe sounds of howling grew closer over time, though. Eventually, Han Sen was able to catch a glimpse or two of the creatures, lurking in the darkness.\n\nBut suddenly, that was the least of their concerns. A giant, red Devil Fang came storming out of the black. It raised its blood wings and stared down at the fireside trio."
