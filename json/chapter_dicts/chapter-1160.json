Would you like to go give it a try?\u201d Ji Yanran said, as she drew invisible circles on Han Sen\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cAn aircraft, huh? Is it better than my beetle?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Han Sen exclaimed, after being bitten on the arm following his boast.\n\n\u201cWhy are you biting me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cAre you going? Yes or no?\u201d Ji Yanran asked, simply.\n\n\u201cYes, of course I\u2019ll go,\u201d Han Sen confirmed.\n\nThe next morning, Han Sen brought Bao\u2019er with him to the store Ji Yanran owned and operated. Her store was the biggest of its kind on Planet Roca. There were many high-class aircraft on display in it.\n\nThe salesmen were all robots, though, and not a single human actually worked there.\n\n\u201cWait for me here; the new aircraft is still in the warehouse. Let me go get it out.\u201d Ji Yanran passed Han Sen her bag and coat. Then, she went towards the control room.\n\nHan Sen brought Bao\u2019er to walk around with him, so they could check out their own store in full.\n\nVery rarely did Han Sen make use of aircraft, and if he did, he\u2019d usually used one that would take him to his destination without any effort on his part. As such, he wasn\u2019t very interested in them.\n\nBut most men loved good, old-fashioned machines, and just seeing them there before him, Han Sen wanted to bring some home. Bao\u2019er, by comparison, was flat-out uninterested. The only interest she had was in the employee-robots of the store.\n\n\u201cHello, young man. Could you help us, please?\u201d As Han Sen observed an aircraft, an old couple approached them. They looked to be in slight distress and confusion.\n\n\u201cHow can I help?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t mind lending a hand.\n\nThe man said, \u201cWe would like to purchase an aircraft, but we haven\u2019t a clue what to choose. Could you help us in deciding, and perhaps provide us a few recommendations?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at them strangely, and he told them, \u201cFor information like that, you\u2019d best ask the robots. They are more informed than I am on such a subject.\u201d\n\nThe man, however, looked embarrassed upon being given that answer. He said, \u201cBut we\u2019ve never interacted with robots before; I have zero education on what to do with them. I would just like to see if there is a simple aircraft I can purchase for casual enjoyment. I just have no clue where to start.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised to learn there were still people in the Alliance who did not have a clue about this sort of stuff. They had to be very old; otherwise, they\u2019d have received the necessary education in school.\n\n\u201cIf you two aren\u2019t in a rush, I can consult my wife. She\u2019s the owner, and thus, she knows a lot more. She can answer all your questions and then some,\u201d Han Sen proposed.\n\n\u201cThat sounds delightful. Thank you so much!\u201d The couple were very happy, and until Ji Yanran showed up, they began to chat about other things.\n\nThe old couple seemed very polite, and subjects of conversation came easy to them.\n\nHan Sen was able to learn they were both nearly three hundred years old, and they were natives to Planet Roca. They had never before left the planet.\n\nThere were more and more old people like them in the Alliance. They hadn\u2019t been to the sanctuaries, but their lifespans were long. They owned a garden, and in their younger years, managed a pet store. They were very good at taming pets, apparently.\n\nWhen people discovered the sanctuary, though, average pets were rarely wanted. Due to this, they had to shut down and keep all the pets for themselves.\n\nThe old man even told Han Sen he had trained creatures for people in the sanctuaries, though. Han Sen asked quite a few questions on this subject, and he was able to learn a lot.\n\nWhen Ji Yanran returned, Han Sen introduced the old couple before handing them over. She then told them everything they needed to know and helped them in their decision-making.\n\nWhen she figured out what the old couple were looking for, Ji Yanran picked out a few aircraft for them to try out.\n\nThey ended up selecting a model of aircraft called Cloud Crane. They thanked Han Sen and Ji Yanran a lot, telling them they were free to come and visit them whenever they wanted to.\n\n\u201cDo you know who they were?\u201d Ji Yanran asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I just met them today. Why? What is the problem?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYou were born on Planet Roca; how could you not know them?\u201d Ji Yanran looked at Han Sen queerly.\n\n\u201cAre they famous, then?\u201d Han Sen truly did not recognize the couple.\n\nJi Yanran shook her head, telling him, \u201cWell, the old couple themselves are not famous. Their son, however, is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s their son?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHave you learned about the Battle of Rekno?\u201d Ji Yanran asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYeah. It was the most important battle humanity ever fought upon entering the space age. It laid the foundation for all we have managed to accomplish.\u201d The battle was indeed very important, so much so, Han Sen still knew much about it.\n\n\u201cDo you remember there was a general who ran out of ammo? So he drove his ship into a ship belonging to the shura?\u201d Ji Yanran asked.\n\n\u201cWait\u2026 They cannot be Xu Henian\u2019s parents!\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nIn the Rekno system, Xu Henian controlled the ship called Phoenix. He selflessly rammed his ship into the shura\u2019s command ship and changed the entire tide of the battle. When the shura lost their primary battleship, their command was lost. It swiftly led to their fall. Humans were then able to take the system, and ever since, the Alliance had been strong and able to grow freely.\n\nXu Henian and the Phoenix, with its ten thousand soldiers, had been written as a tale of paramount importance for the development and future expansion of humanity.\n\nBy most of humanity, it was regarded as a great triumph. But for the families of Xu Henian and the ten thousand families caught in grief and mourning, it was a disaster.\n\nNow, Han Sen was able to understand why they chose the ship Cloud Crane."
