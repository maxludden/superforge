    "text": "\"I\u2019ll just fight her. She\u2019s just a woman after all,\" Han Sen whispered to himself.\n\nHan Sen knew that Qin Xuan would not leave him alone no matter how he restrained himself. So he would no longer do that. He had almost mastered Ghosthaunt, and it would be great for him to practice it on her.\n\nWhen Han Sen stood in front of Qin Xuan in a combat suit, she didn\u2019t spare any effort and kicked him with a leg sweep.\n\nFor Han Sen, who was good at sneak attacks, as long as he had no chance to sneak up, he was doomed to lose. Hence Qin Xuan hit first and didn\u2019t give Han Sen any chance.\n\nBut she had still committed a great mistake: she still didn\u2019t take Han Sen seriously enough and did not regard him as an opponent. All she wanted to do was to kick his ass. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t use even half her strength.\n\nIn her mind, he was still the ignorant Ass Freak, a rookie who could be bullied by anyone in the shelter.\n\nQin Xuan did not really want to harm Han Sen, so she wasn\u2019t hitting hard.\n\nBut what she didn\u2019t know was that Han Sen now had 18 sacred geno points and was practicing Jadeskin. Although not as fit as her, the gap between them was not so big either.\n\nSeeing her leg sweep, Han Sen moved to a spot where Qin Xuan couldn\u2019t reach and twisted her leg with his arms. She immediately lost balance and fell to the ground.\n\nHan Sen immediately pressed himself against her and locked her limbs down.\n\nQin Xuan hadn\u2019t expected such nifty moves from him, and when she realized her mistake, she was trapped and couldn\u2019t wriggle free.\n\nFeeling anger and shame, she struggled and failed because of the clever techniques of Ghosthaunt. If she struggled with all her strength, her arms would be dislocated or even broken. Trapped by Han Sen, she blushed and still couldn\u2019t believe Han Sen had taken her with the first move. She wanted to teach him a lesson, and everything went wrong.\n\n\"Stationmaster, did I win?\" Han Sen was secretly pleased. \"I did not expect Old Devil\u2019s teaching to work. I even beat Qin Xuan.\"\n\n\"You will never win.\" Qin Xuan raged and refused to throw in the towel.\n\nIf it was anyone else, it might be fine. But for this despicable Ass Freak, she would not bow her head.\n\nQin Xuan roared and shapeshifted into a golden lion taller than a man. Han Sen was thrown off her instantaneously, and the lion swooped down at him.\n\n\"Foul! We have agreed not to use any beast souls,\" Han Sen quickly shouted.\n\nQin Xuan paused as her lion paw was about to hit him. She did promise last time that she wouldn\u2019t use beast souls. But under the circumstances, she had completely forgotten about it.\n\n\"Alright, no beast souls.\" Qin Xuan secretly blushed, took back her beast soul and launched an attack with her fist.\n\nHan Sen still hadn\u2019t completely mastered Ghosthaunt, and his fitness and experience fell short compared to Qin Xuan. Although he resisted over 20 movements from her, he was still beat.\n\nQin Xuan did not say anything and turned away. In fact, she felt ashamed because if she hadn\u2019t used her beast soul, she couldn\u2019t have gotten rid of Han Sen. So, she had already lost at that moment.\n\n\"I\u2019m still not strong enough. My geno points and fighting skills were not even close to hers.\" Han Sen knew that he couldn\u2019t have caught up with the best in Steel Armor Shelter in such a short amount of time, while he was still a little disappointed that he couldn\u2019t even take 30 movements from her.\n\nQin Xuan was still blushing after a shower. She was truly abashed that she was put in such a tough situation by Ass Freak.\n\n\"Something is wrong. Although his wrestling skills were not bad, he couldn\u2019t have locked me down without great fitness. How did he gain so many geno points?\" thought Qin Xuan suddenly. She quickly called out the data collected in Han Sen\u2019s combat suit.\n\nQin Xuan clenched her lips and cursed bitterly, \"That bastard, he must have maxed out on his mutant geno points already. He was just playing weak to make me underestimate him. Ass Freak, I\u2019ll never make peace with you.\"\n\nFrom then on, every time Han Sen passed the teleport station, Qin Xuan would always call him into the combat room.\n\nHan Sen was glad to oblige. Wrestling skills such as Ghosthaunt really need much practice, and with a training partner as good as Qin Xuan, he could not really hone his techniques. Some pain was nothing compared to his gain.\n\nIf it was not for Qin Xuan, Han Sen could only practice when risking his life, which was far more dangerous than his fights with her.\n\nOf course, Han Sen was careful so that she didn\u2019t notice he was using her. Each time he would get on her nerves on purpose so that she would keep calling him to the combat room.\n\nQin Xuan picked on Han Sen many times but still didn\u2019t get over it. Every time she saw his smiling face, she would get mad and have an urge to beat him up. It almost became a habit of hers."
