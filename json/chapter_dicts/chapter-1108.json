As he held her, he swiftly examined her wounds to check how badly she was hurt.\n\nShe had been severely injured, and the sacred-blood armor Han Sen had lent her had been practically destroyed. Only shreds of it remained clinging to her blood-soaked body.\n\nThe garments she wore beneath the armor had also been torn and ripped away. Despite most of her body being exposed, it was unlikely you\u2019d feel horny seeing her in such a condition.\n\nHer entire body was covered in wounds and lacerations, and many areas had scabbed. Others were still fresh, oozing blood. Some cuts were so deep, you could see the bone. There was one particular cut running the length of her stomach. Had the cut been any deeper, her guts would be falling out.\n\n\u201cShe has fought hard.\u201d Han Sen believed he had gotten into a bad state before, due to pushing himself too hard, but Queen was taking the cake.\n\nHan Sen used his holy light on her damaged body. It was a simulation of the Holy Rhino\u2019s energy flow, and while it was effective for most injuries, it did little for grave wounds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to bear with me for this next bit, okay?\u201d Han Sen had to then simulate the silver fox\u2019s healing powers to heal her.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nQueen\u2019s body was consumed by fierce lightning. Her body twitched violently, but she did not scream under the duress of that excruciating pain. She merely clenched her teeth and held her vocal cords.\n\n\u201cThis lightning heals wounds better than you might think,\u201d Han Sen comforted her as he pumped the volts into her ravaged body.\n\nThe armor he had given her was burned to a crisp, but the nasty wounds she had suffered were healing quick.\n\nQueen was by far the strongest woman Han Sen had ever come to know. Whenever Han Sen was healed by the silver fox, he\u2019d end up screaming. Queen had only groaned low a couple of times.\n\nMost of her wounds were sorted by now, but the deep cut across her stomach was going to take a lot more of the charge to get fixed.\n\nAfter an hour of this lightning and pain, even Han Sen was feeling guilty over the treatment he had to give her. But like a brave soldier, she did not moan or complain once. She endured it all like a champ.\n\n\u201cYou should go bathe in the healing pools of the Alliance. You should be fit as a fiddle in a few days.\u201d Han Sen had managed to heal the worst of her wounds, but he could not bring himself to make her suffer any longer.\n\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d Queen\u2019s teeth quivered and chattered as she spoke.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no difference now between what I can give you and what you can get in the Alliance. All I can provide, in addition, is needless pain,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThis is faster.\u201d Queen was firm in her desire.\n\nHan Sen vehemently shook his head, but eventually complied with her request. Then, he started to electrocute her with the healing charges again.\n\nHalf an hour later, all her wounds had sealed and healed. All that was left was the presence of red marks where they once had been.\n\nQueen summoned a beast soul armor and said, \u201cHave you recovered?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost there.\u201d Han Sen had revealed to her he could make use of his powers, so there was no use hiding it.\n\nShe nodded and started to leave the shelter once more.\n\nHan Sen stopped her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go. There\u2019s something I need to talk to you about.\u201d\n\nQueen stopped walking and turned around.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m almost healed, I will soon be leaving this place. I\u2019m returning to my old shelter; would you like to come with me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nQueen nodded and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had expected he\u2019d have to explain, and he was surprised when she agreed so quickly.\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cWhat happened to you, anyway? How did you get hurt?\u201d\n\nQueen said, \u201cTo the west is another disheveled shelter. I had wished to make use of its teleporter, but I was attacked.\u201d\n\nShe gave him further details, and following the explanation, Han Sen retreated into deep thought.\n\nAlthough she hadn\u2019t been there long, Queen had managed to gather many geno points. With Han Sen\u2019s beast souls, she could easily escape the clutches of a sacred-blood creature.\n\nBut the creatures had managed to injure her badly, and that suggested they had to be at least sacred-blood creatures.\n\nShe had tried to flee upon seeing them, but one in particular had managed to tackle her by surprise.\n\nIt was fortunate she had been brutally hit by the sacred-blood; otherwise, she\u2019d have waltzed into the domain of a super creature.\n\n\u201cTake me to that shelter.\u201d If there really was a super creature, Han Sen would be quite pleased. Bao\u2019er, seeing Han Sen leave the shelter, swiftly followed and leaped onto his back.\n\nHan Sen had been in that shelter for a very long time, and Bao\u2019er had been bored of the area for a while now.\n\nQueen guided Han Sen west, and half an hour later, they stumbled across the remains of a slain creature.\n\nIt was a frighteningly large mantis that was around the same size as a fully-grown wolf. Its carapace was purple, and the two arms were like scythes.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the creatures that cut you up?\u201d Han Sen saw that Queen had killed it as she escaped.\n\nQueen said, \u201cDemon-Blood Mantis, yes. They were mostly primitive, but this one was mutant.\u201d\n\nThey continued walking, and there must have been thirty of the beasts all strewn about the plains there. It had obviously been a nasty fight.\n\nWith Golden Growler\u2019s speed, it only took them two hours to reach the shelter. Just like every other shelter in the area, it looked to be in disarray. It had been abandoned by spirits a long time ago.\n\nThere were no signs of the mantises though, so it seemed like the rest of the horde had retreated back into the deeper recesses of the shelter.\n\n\u201cWait here; I\u2019m going to take a closer look,\u201d Han Sen told her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Queen followed.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Protesting would be of no use, so Han Sen summoned Disloyal Knight and had it take the lead."
