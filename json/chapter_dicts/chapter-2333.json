    "text": "It had taken a lot of work for Han Sen to get into the Pavilion, and he had also risked exposure. It wasn\u2019t worth it if he had only gotten a servant girl for his efforts.\n\nBao\u2019er leaned her head to the side and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think that she has another function.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan she fight?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBao\u2019er lifted the gourd and pointed at the chair. She shouted, \u201cHit it!\u201d\n\nThe water fairy went to the chair immediately, but her watery body broke as soon as she came into contact with it. The chair moved a little, but no actual lasting damage had been done.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Bao\u2019er shook her head.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be the servant of the Sacred leader. The Extreme King\u2019s alpha surely wouldn\u2019t be this lame, leaving behind such a weak item for his children.\u201d Han Sen looked at the water fairy.\n\nBao\u2019er asked the water fairy to give her a massage. The water fairy complied with the directive immediately, so it seemed as if she lacked a will of her own. It was a high class doll.\n\nHan Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look at the water fairy, and what he saw shocked him. The water fairy\u2019s body was an energy substance, and it was very tightly constructed. It seemed to contain a deified power, the likes of which Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen before.\n\n\u201cWeird. Such strong power, but why doesn\u2019t it deal any damage? What does this thing actually do?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he looked at the water fairy.\n\nBao\u2019er was having fun with it, at least. While the water fairy was rubbing her shoulders, Bao\u2019er also instructed it to begin feeding her.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, how do I make use of this jade gourd?\u201d Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. Perhaps using the gourd himself would let him investigate it further.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy. Just put your energy into the gourd.\u201d Bao\u2019er handed it back to Han Sen.\n\nAfter the gourd left Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand, the water fairy shattered and returned to the jade gourd like liquid.\n\nHan Sen tried putting his power into the jade gourd, but he couldn\u2019t make it work. Then he tried it again, and when he put his power inside it, the jade gourd worked. The water fairy bound itself to Han Sen\u2019s will and emerged from the jade gourd.\n\n\u201cThis thing is strange, but I really don\u2019t know what she does.\u201d Han Sen tried a few commands, making sure he was able to control the water fairy. Then, he put the jade gourd and the water fairy away.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, did you get any information from your time with Lan Haixin?\u201d Han Sen asked Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er nodded and said, \u201cShe and Bai Yi had a meeting arranged for the ninth of next month. They will be opening the relic, and she says Bai Yi has the genes of another race in him. But the genes aren\u2019t complete. She says the chances that the relic will select Bai Yi are low. She thinks she will be able to control the relic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she tell you what the relic might have been?\u201d Han Sen asked further, pleased with the revelations.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Bao\u2019er shook her head and swallowed some food.\n\n\u201cGood. Keep gathering all the information you can. Once you have found something, try to find a way to reach me,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\n\u201cI promise I will do that.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked so serious, and she gave Han Sen a salute.\n\n\u201cGood. You are the pride of the people and the nation, and you are the pride of your daddy, too.\u201d Han Sen convinced Bao\u2019er to go back. Then, he got to thinking about what he himself might need to do.\n\nThe little red bird followed after Bao\u2019er, but Han Sen didn\u2019t worry about her.\n\nHan Sen was most worried about the ramifications of the previous day. He hadn\u2019t known that opening the alpha statue would cause so much trouble, and right now, the entire Extreme King society was still in the midst of dealing with their shock. Many eyes would be focused on him in the times to come.\n\n\u201cConsidering Bai Yi\u2019s pride and desire for attention, he wouldn\u2019t maintain a low profile after suddenly becoming so famous. I need to go somewhere.\u201d Han Sen got to thinking about where he should go.\n\nHan Sen looked at the blood kirin, and then his eyes turned bright. \u201cYes! I should make the blood kirin register as my royal guard. Then, I can go to King\u2019s Garden to steal a primary root king dragon. Only the princes and princesses are allowed to go to King\u2019s Garden. No one there is deified. I still can\u2019t reveal myself, but at least I won\u2019t be left exposed to the people most likely to see through my disguise. And I can steal plenty of resources. Right, I should do that. I should go to King\u2019s Garden.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen said that, he took the blood kirin with him and registered it as a royal guard. Then, he rushed to King\u2019s Garden.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, Bai Yi has left home. He took the blood kirin to register as a royal guard. And now, he is going to King\u2019s Garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Princess, Bai Yi took the blood kirin to King\u2019s Garden.\u201d\n\nThe same report was delivered to each and every palace. Many princes and princesses now raced to King\u2019s Garden.\n\nThey wanted to know what was going on with Bai Yi. The idea that he had claimed the alpha\u2019s statue was way too strange, and many royal children thought it was suspicious.\n\n\u201cHe is out? I want to see if this is actually Bai Yi, or if it is really Han Sen.\u201d Miss Mirror was holding a big mirror that reflected Han Sen\u2019s movement inside King\u2019s Garden. She paid special attention to the ring Han Sen was still wearing. Every few seconds, Miss Mirror would turn her eyes to glance at that ring. Then, she unconsciously touched the identical ring she wore on her own finger.\n\nHan Sen had gone there with Bai Wei once, so he knew the way to go. He brought the blood kirin with him to King\u2019s Garden.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t fond of the bearded dragons, and he rode the blood kirin towards the king tree. He wanted to find one of those thick, primary root king dragons.\n\nBut as soon as the blood kirin started to move, a few shadows appeared before them. Han Sen examined them and realized it was a bunch of people he had never seen before.\n\nHe recognized some of them from the information Mister White had given him, however. The first one was Prince Swordstar. He was the forty-seventh royal child, and he was Bai Yi\u2019s little brother. But he wasn\u2019t from the same mother.\n\n\u201cBrother Forty-Seven, why are you blocking my way?\u201d Han Sen asked, his expression gloomy.\n\nPrince Swordstar smiled. He looked quite handsome as he said, \u201cI am here to congratulate you, Brother Sixteen, on acquiring an understanding of the Extreme King alpha. And I am curious what the Extreme King alpha left behind in the Pavilion. I hope you will be able to tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t tell you?\u201d Han Sen asked with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cThen this little brother is going to have to teach you a lesson,\u201d Prince Swordstar said coldly.\n\n\u201cHa! You aren\u2019t worthy of challenging me. Beat my guard first,\u201d Han Sen replied haughtily.\n\nThe blood kirin roared. A red mist covered its body, exerting intense pressure on the surrounding area. A blood shadow came right for Prince Swordstar.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who has a guard.\u201d Prince Swordstar\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. Without a command, his own guard leaped out to fight the blood kirin."
