Now that Yaksha had appeared, proving formidable enough to do so and give the creatures what they desired, they had hope. But Han Sen had come along to stop Yaksha, and with only him in their way, they all thought it best to chip in and stop the meddler.\n\nHan Sen had done what he could in the time he had, but under fire from so many super creatures, he knew it would now be best to run.\n\nWhile he wished to save Xiang Yin and ensure her success, Disloyal Knight and the Blue Dinosaur were not enough to repel the assault of a dozen super creatures.\n\nEven if Han Sen did stay and fight, Yaksha would be free to fly towards that door while the super creatures kept his foe occupied. Remaining there would be a pointless endeavor, and stopping Yaksha any further would be silly.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Han Sen yelled back towards Queen and the Blue Dinosaur.\n\nBlue Dinosaur was no sharper than a bag of socks, but even it wasn\u2019t dumb enough to try to withstand a dozen super creatures. It knew it was time to run, and so it did.\n\nQueen was atop it, and she rode it back into the tunnels they had come from.\n\nHan Sen tried to veil the seven senses of the creatures, so they could neither hear nor see him.\n\nBut its effectiveness on super creatures was practically null, and it did not quell their raging stampede towards him. All Han Sen could do was focus on his flight out.\n\n\u201cYou had it coming!\u201d Yaksha coldly mocked, before turning to go for the door.\n\nThe nine steps Xiang Yin had traversed were brutal and endowed with a hungry fire that ravaged all who sought to ascend. She was little more than a shadow at this point, and that shadow was flickering faintly, as if it was about to be completely dispelled by a dazzling light.\n\nXiang Yin had been aware of what was occurring outside of the door, and she had been touched by Han Sen\u2019s bravery in trying to secure safe passage for her.\n\nWhen he fled from the attacks of the super creatures, she completely understood.\n\nNearing the end of her painful journey, Xiang Yin decided to forget about Yaksha who was now homing in on her. She now had to focus on completing what she had started.\n\nShe concentrated on withstanding the fire that sought to incinerate her. She could not allow her mind to waver, falter, or be distracted by the incoming threat. If her mind wandered for a second, it\u2019d be her demise.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is my fate.\u201d Xiang Yin was still composed, and she didn\u2019t feel hatred for the one who came for her.\n\nHan Sen had already fought on her behalf for a while, but she hadn\u2019t yet been able to make that final step. Even if Yaksha wasn\u2019t there to disturb her, she was teetering on the brink of failure.\n\nThis was a life and death moment for her. This was the single moment that would decide her future, for there would be no return to the present.\n\nXiang Yin had no choice now but to ascend. She could not return; she could only go on. Go on or fall.\n\nThe jellylike fruit would vaporize shortly after becoming ripe, so she couldn\u2019t eat it anywhere else at any other time.\n\nYaksha had now reached the door. He could tell Xiang Yin was about to fail, even if he hadn\u2019t come to meddle with her ascension.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame you have become my enemy, but I cannot allow you to go to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary,\u201d Yaksha said as he watched her burn.\n\nXiang Yin paid no heed to his words and maintained her focus on the task at hand.\n\nAlthough she looked like she was going to fail, just in case, Yaksha pulled out something to throw beyond the door.\n\nYaksha had not yet opened ten gene locks, so he was not foolish enough to enter himself. If he went inside, he\u2019d be turned into soot in a matter of seconds.\n\nSo, aware of this, he had an item. If he threw this item inside, there was a high chance it would secure her demise.\n\nWhat Yaksha was holding was a black-metal fruit called a \u201cCrimson Fruit.\u201d It was attuned with the element of fire, and it had been obtained from a king spirit tree.\n\nIf he threw it inside, it could pollute the holy, cleansing fire.\n\nThe holy fire cleansed those who walked through it. It rinsed and burned away past sins and removed your old body to provide a new one that was spotless. It was a necessary process to become a demi-god.\n\nOnce the tenth step had been reached, you would become a demi-god.\n\nYaksha wanted to pollute the holy fire, though. The dirt of the fruit was said to warp and sour the cleansing process and provide greater damage to whoever walked through it.\n\n\u201cXiang Yin, I will take your place in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary and find Ancient Devil Emperor.\u201d Yaksha smiled as he prepared to chuck the fruit inside.\n\nXiang Yin believed there now to be no hope. Seeing the fruit leave Yaksha\u2019s hand, she sighed.\n\nBut the moment the fruit was about to cross through the doorframe, it stopped. It appeared as if something was pulling it back.\n\nIn the next second, the flight of the fruit was course-corrected, and it ended up flying in the opposite direction. A hand then grabbed the Crimson Fruit.\n\nYaksha saw it happen, and he realized that someone had just claimed his fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Yaksha and Xiang Yin both exclaimed.\n\nHan Sen, all bloodied, now possessed the fruit. He smiled and said, \u201cYou are a noob who does not even have ten gene locks open. You\u2019re using this to disrupt her ascension? Cheap. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s mine now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are dead.\u201d Yaksha\u2019s face turned green. He flapped his wings and soared towards Han Sen."
