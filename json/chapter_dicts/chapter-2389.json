    "text": "Han Sen started to pull back to say something, but he saw Fox Queen\u2019s tail begin to wave back and forth. Afterimages of the tail became substance chains, and it suddenly looked as if there were nine tails swinging in the air. The tails swept up and around Fox Queen and Han Sen, trapping them inside it like a cage.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s eyes flashed silver, and strange silver symbols flared to life across her snow-white skin. They looked like tattoos, not on her skin but inside it.\n\nAt the same time, power that gushed like spring water rushed between Fox Queen\u2019s lips and straight into Han Sen\u2019s mouth.\n\nA cool air surged through Han Sen\u2019s body. His cells felt as if they had been thoroughly cleansed by a mountain spring.\n\nOnce that cool power blended into Han Sen\u2019s cells, his body underwent some peculiar changes. A perfume that he could barely smell wafted from his body, its fragrance tickling the tip of his nose.\n\n\u201cI have given you the secret Fox technique. Your body now possesses the Nine Spin Fox power. If you follow my will and use the Nine Spin Fox Perfume skill, you can temporarily wield the powers of a Fox.\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s lips remained locked with Han Sen\u2019s, but her voice sounded in Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\nHan Sen nodded slightly. Following Fox Queen\u2019s will, he let the power course through him.\n\nFox Queen sent more and more of that power into Han Sen\u2019s body. Han Sen got the power running, and it began to build. The perfume grew stronger and stronger. It felt as if Han Sen was swimming in a sea of flowers.\n\nShortly after, the perfume in Han Sen\u2019s body became lighter until it disappeared, and he could no longer smell it at all. A minute later, the perfume was coming back.\n\nThe scent kept cycling between strong and light, and it did this nine times. Fox Queen\u2019s power inside Han Sen had become very strong, and it combined with Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nA very light silver symbol appeared on Han Sen\u2019s skin. It looked similar to the symbols on Fox Queen, but it wasn\u2019t as lustrous as those. Han Sen\u2019s symbol was quite dull, by comparison.\n\nUpon seeing the silver flower symbol appear on Han Sen, Fox Queen felt incredibly happy.\n\nShe had thought that Han Sen didn\u2019t have any Fox blood, so she only expected him to absorb around twenty percent of the power she poured into the Nine Spin Fox Perfume.\n\nBut for some reason, Han Sen had been able to absorb every ounce of the Nine Spin Fox Perfume energy she had sent to him. Because of this, the Fox marking had appeared on his skin. Fox Queen was surprised, to say the least.\n\n\u201cWeird. Does his body contain some sort of Fox blood or something? How is he capable of supporting a Fox symbol?\u201d Fox Queen was confused.\n\nBut after a second or so, Fox Queen made a decision. She had originally planned to stop the skill here, but instead, she kept it running.\n\nThe silver markings on Fox Queen\u2019s skin continued to expand. The symbols slowly connected with each other, forming a nine-tailed silver fox upon her back.\n\nThat symbol was so strange. It was like a living fox lying across Fox Queen\u2019s pale skin. It had small silver eyes, and they peered right at Han Sen.\n\nThe more power Fox Queen gave Han Sen, the brighter his silver pattern became. The silver symbols flashed continually, and just like Fox Queen\u2019s, they started to connect. They soon started to resemble a nine-tailed fox that shone like burnished silver.\n\nHan Sen felt as if all the energy inside him was rushing crazily around his body. He felt like a wild horse without its reins. Things were slipping out of his control.\n\n\u201cFox Queen, stop! I cannot take it anymore.\u201d Han Sen spoke to Fox Queen through his will.\n\nFox Queen ignored him. Her arms were wrapped around Han Sen\u2019s neck, and her legs tightened around his waist. They were still kissing as silver substance chains thrust deep into Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cFox Queen! What are you doing?\u201d Han Sen demanded with his will. His face hardened as he began to struggle against her, but Fox Queen\u2019s power was able to keep his suppressed.\n\nFox Queen finally responded. She smiled. She didn\u2019t move her lips, but her voice played inside Han Sen\u2019s ears all the same. \u201cI never thought this body of yours possessed such extraordinary talent. You can generate the Fox markings. I have used all my Nine Spin Fox Perfume to help you, so that your body can naturally become a Nine Spin Fox Body. It will be great for you, and it will allow you to control the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror far more easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cFox Queen, do you really think I am three years old?\u201d Han Sen growled through his will.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s smile widened. \u201cMy good brother, why don\u2019t you just do as you are told? I will not treat you poorly.\u201d\n\nAs Fox Queen\u2019s words echoed through Han Sen\u2019s head, a silver substance chain drifted into Han Sen\u2019s mouth. Han Sen\u2019s Nine Spin Fox power was becoming stronger and stronger.\n\nThe power was almost out of Han Sen\u2019s control. It followed Fox Queen\u2019s will, running amok inside his body. The nine-tailed silver fox symbol on Han Sen\u2019s skin brightened, and it looked as if it was going to come alive.\n\nNow Han Sen was certain that Fox Queen wasn\u2019t trying to give him a technique; she was attempting to gain control of his body.\n\nFox Queen wouldn\u2019t admit to that, of course. She ignored Han Sen\u2019s attempts to reason with her as she continued pouring her power inside him.\n\nJust as Han Sen believed, Fox Queen was trying to refine Han Sen\u2019s body into a Nine Spin Fox clone. If she did that, she would be able to control Han Sen completely. There would be no need for the precariousness of cooperation. She could save herself the trouble by controlling him directly.\n\nThis idea had come to her suddenly. She hadn\u2019t expected Han Sen\u2019s body to be capable of generating a fox symbol. What she said, in the beginning, wasn\u2019t all a lie.\n\nHan Sen understood Fox Queen, and he had never really trusted her anyway. It didn\u2019t matter if she was telling the truth or not, though; he had a plan of his own.\n\nIf Fox Queen had just been honest and given Han Sen a new ability as she promised, he would have been disappointed. If she had done that, she wouldn\u2019t have given Han Sen enough power to fulfill his plan.\n\nHan Sen wanted to use Fox Queen\u2019s power to push his self-universe cogwheel. That way, he could reach King class.\n\nThis was a big risk. But compared to attempting to subjugate someone else\u2019s power in the midst of a fight, this was far easier.\n\nPower that had been summoned for combat would be far more destructive. Guiding it into his body without destroying himself wouldn\u2019t be easy. Controlling it with enough precision to move the self-universe cogwheel would be even harder.\n\nBut now, Fox Queen was sending her power directly into Han Sen\u2019s body, and the power wasn\u2019t intended to harm him. That saved him so much trouble. Han Sen knew this was the best chance he would get to borrow deified power.\n\nWhen Han Sen felt that the necessary amount of energy had built up within him, he didn\u2019t hesitate. He engaged his Dongxuan Sutra. He wanted to use that power to push his self-universe cogwheel.\n\nFox Queen felt something suddenly shift within Han Sen\u2019s body. She realized what Han Sen was trying to do, and she chuckled deep in her throat.\n\n\u201cHow ridiculous! Your weak powers cannot divert powers like mine.\u201d"
