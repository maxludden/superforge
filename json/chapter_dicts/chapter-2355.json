    "text": "Han Sen floated down until his feet rested on the surface of the water. He had no plans to escape. He looked at Nine-Headed Bird and said, \u201cI will remain standing here. You can use whatever sort of power you wish, and if my feet cause any ripples in the water, then I forfeit and lose.\u201d\n\nWhen Nine-Headed Bird heard Han Sen\u2019s declaration, he drifted down to the sea\u2019s surface as well. His bird-with-nine-heads appearance returned to something human-like again. He smiled and said, \u201cAs I should have expected from a prince of the Extreme King: you are true to your word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you Pirates are trustworthy, but the Extreme King are,\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\nNine-Headed Bird smiled and said, \u201cThere is no need to try to provoke me. If you keep your end of the bargain, I will not break the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. You strike first.\u201d Han Sen stood atop the sea, unmoving.\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll strike first,\u201d Nine-Headed Bird said, but he continued looking at Han Sen without attacking.\n\nNine-Headed Bird was certain that he could defeat Han Sen as long as the Kingese were not a factor. Making Han Sen move would be easy.\n\nBut Han Sen was a prince of the Extreme King, so Nine-Headed Bird knew better than to attack carelessly. He considered the best way to move Han Sen from his spot.\n\n\u201cWhat? You still haven\u2019t attacked. Is a half-deified being terrified of me?\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nNine-Headed Bird lifted his lips in a sneer. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Trying to provoke me won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Nine-Headed Bird looked at Han Sen and thought to himself, \u201cHis Original Water King Body cannot be destroyed. Even if I completely wreck his upper body, his legs might remain untouched. No matter how powerful my hit is, it\u2019s not guaranteed that I can move his feet.\u201d\n\nThinking of that, Nine-Headed Bird had an idea. He prepared to strike.\n\n\u201cHang on.\u201d Han Sen suddenly raised his hand to stop the man.\n\n\u201cWhat? Are you regretting our agreement?\u201d Nine-Headed Bird stared at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen laughed. \u201cI have nothing to regret, but before you strike, we should discuss our deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat game are you trying to play now? We already established the terms of our bargain; you give me the Ancient God Origin if you lose. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Nine-Headed Bird frowned.\n\n\u201cI will relinquish the Ancient God Origin if I lose, but what if you lose? If we don\u2019t sort out that aspect of the bargain, you might keep trying to take my Ancient God Origin after you lose. I have no protection here,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIf I lose, I won\u2019t try to take the Ancient God Origin again. Even if you threw it on the ground before me, I wouldn\u2019t dare to pick it up,\u201d Nine-Headed Bird said.\n\n\u201cAwesome. Come on, then.\u201d Han Sen activated his Original Water King Body, and his entire body became translucent. He stood atop the sea as if he was connected to it.\n\n\u201cSo you were planning to use the Original Water King Body to win. That was a poor choice.\u201d Nine-Headed Bird coldly hummed. He raised his hand, and a black demonic air gathered in front of his fist. It formed a ceaselessly swirling black hole.\n\nBzzt!\n\nNine-Headed Bird punched toward Han Sen, and space itself trembled around his fist. The black hole moved directly toward Han Sen, and its frightening power tugged on everything around it.\n\nHan Sen was still some distance from the black hole, but it was already pulling at him. His water body shook, as if the water of his form could break away and be sucked into the black hole at any time.\n\nNine-Headed Bird\u2019s attack didn\u2019t strike Han Sen\u2019s body directly. Rather than being intended as a destructive attack, it was meant to affect Han Sen\u2019s balance. Its magnetic force would keep pulling until Han Sen\u2019s body was sucked inside.\n\nBecause Nine-Headed Bird had greater power, Han Sen\u2019s body would be drawn in by the black hole. There was no way he could lose.\n\nHan Sen barely seemed to notice the black hole, though. He remained motionless atop the water. He was not moving into the black hole.\n\nNine-Headed Bird frowned. His attack was better than any Han Sen could unleash without using his Kingese power. He should have been falling into the black hole.\n\nBut Han Sen wasn\u2019t moving. He wasn\u2019t using the Kingese or some sort of xenogeneic treasure, either. Nine-Headed Bird stared at Han Sen in confusion.\n\nHan Sen laughed. He had suggested this bet because he knew he would win. He wouldn\u2019t take this risk on a whim.\n\nNine-Headed Bird couldn\u2019t see anything strange about Han Sen\u2019s stance, but Han Sen still could have used some sort of trick without his knowledge.\n\nHan Sen had suggested this bet because he had the Silver-Winged Dragon beast soul.\n\nKing class xenogeneic beast soul Silver-Winged Dragon: area type\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if only King class beast souls had an area-of-effect, but at that moment, it was the only area beast soul that he had.\n\nThe Silver-Winged Dragon could deploy a water area, but it was different from Bai Yi\u2019s natural water area. This water area was called the dragon area. The sea dragon had the soul of the sea, so if Han Sen used the dragon area in the water, he could become a part of the sea. His body melded with the sea itself.\n\nHan Sen stood atop the sea, using the power of the sea to keep him erect. Although he couldn\u2019t control it with accuracy, he couldn\u2019t be moved unless Nine-Headed Bird summoned enough power to shift the entire sea.\n\nA bar of iron might be easily moved, but if it was welded onto an aircraft carrier, no amount of pulling could force it to budge.\n\nOf course, a stick couldn\u2019t control an aircraft carrier. But merely remaining stable was enough for Han Sen.\n\nWith the dragon area, standing atop the sea made Han Sen effectively immortal. Nine-Headed Bird could do nothing to him.\n\nNine-Headed Bird kept increasing the strength of his black hole, but he was unable to move Han Sen. His eyes began to widen.\n\nXius watched the contest, frozen in place. She had no idea how Han Sen was pulling this off.\n\n\u201cNine-Headed Bird, can you keep going?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nNine-Headed Bird grunted coldly. He dismissed his black hole, then lowered his arms. He spoke to Han Sen, \u201cCome. If you can move me, then I lose. If I do not move, then I will attack again. We will decide the victor then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will start,\u201d Han Sen said, summoning his wings. He flapped his wings and flew far away.\n\nNine-Headed Bird\u2019s eyes bulged. Han Sen was about to disappear from his vision. He was so mad that he turned into the nine-headed demon bird again. He ran after Han Sen and angrily shouted, \u201cDisgusting Extreme King! Are you going to embarrass your father like that? You lose!\u201d\n\nHan Sen stopped. He turned around and looked at Nine-Headed Bird with a grin.\n\n\u201cWhat is this bullsh*t?\u201d Nine-Headed Bird slid to a stop. His face turned a sickly green as he realized he had just been tricked.\n\nHe had lost because he chased after Han Sen. He had fallen for the simplest of ploys."
