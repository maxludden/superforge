    "text": "\u201cHow about I tell you the secret of the chessboards, and you let me go,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cJust pretend you have never seen me before.\u201d\n\nHoly Pirate had to shake his head. \u201cEven thieves have a moral code. I accepted a job and received the sky silk picture. I cannot go back on my word and break my promise.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt depressed and replied, \u201cYou are just a thief. Don\u2019t talk to me about having morals. Does your brain have a problem?\u201d\n\nHoly Pirate preferred to not go back on his word about handing Han Sen over learning the secret of the chessboards. That really depressed Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen suddenly thought of something. He said, \u201cIf you think things are really that way, then you don\u2019t have to let me go. I will use the chessboards\u2019 secret to barter with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of trade are you thinking about?\u201d Holy Pirate did not want to give up learning the secrets of the chessboards. He looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\n\u201cI will hire you to kidnap me again.\u201d Han Sen said. He sounded like he was rapping hip-hop.\n\nStill, Holy Pirate understood what Han Sen meant. \u201cWhat you mean to say is that you want me to kidnap you back from the Extreme King once you\u2019ve been handed over, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is absolutely right,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod.\n\n\u201cThat is not something easily done,\u201d Holy Pirate quietly said.\n\n\u201cYou can easily go around the Space Garden,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cIs it really that hard to penetrate the Extreme King?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this universe, no one can enter the Space Garden freely except for me,\u201d Holy Pirate said. \u201cEntering the Extreme King is easier than going to the Space Garden, but the Extreme Kings have many elites in their ranks. And, there is, of course, that horny old man, Bai King. That guy is a true god-class guy. Stealing you under their all-seeing eyes without bringing attention to myself would be incredibly difficult. If I am exposed and they learned I stole you, I am afraid I would have to keep running for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, it doesn\u2019t work for you no matter what I suggest.\u201d Han Sen smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should call yourself Holy Pirate. Instead, you should call yourself the Crybaby Pirate.\u201d\n\nHoly Pirate was not angry. He went silent for a little while before saying, \u201cThat is fine. I might need to take a risk, but it is worth it for the secret of the chessboards. Tell me, what is the secret of the chessboards?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will trade when you\u2019ve done your part. Once you have rescued me from the Extreme King, I will tell you what you need to know.\u201d Han Sen was not going to divulge the secrets of the chessboards to Holy Pirate just yet.\n\n\u201cI would never betray a promise I made. Everyone in this universe knows I keep my word.\u201d Holy Pirate stroked his beard and looked at Han Sen. He looked angry.\n\n\u201cYou are a thief that kidnaps children, so why would I believe you?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHoly Pirate was speechless. His three-rule pirate code consisted of the fact he would never steal a child, but he did not consider xenogeneics as counting. After all, hunting xenogeneics or eating xenogeneics was perfectly normal in the universe. Holy Pirate would never have believed this xenogeneic could be so smart and possess the personality it did.\n\n\u201cIt is the same as when I go and save you,\u201d Holy Pirate coldly said.\n\n\u201cWho left the pictures of the 17 stalemates on the walls?\u201d Han Sen changed the subject and pointed at the chessboards scrawled into the walls.\n\n\u201cAn old fart monster.\u201d Holy Pirate seemed to be in a bad mood. He did not answer Han Sen\u2019s question. He went back to his rocking chair and fell asleep.\n\nHan Sen examined the stalemates alone. After researching them for a while, he was unable to open the password of the chests. Thus, he had to remember them.\n\nThe next morning, someone was outside the valley calling out for Holy Pirate. When Han Sen heard the voice, he immediately knew it was Bai Wanjie.\n\n\u201cIt really is him,\u201d Han Sen coldly grunted. \u201cWhat an annoying man. Don\u2019t let me see you again.\u201d\n\nHoly Pirate picked up Han Sen and teleported away from the valley. He threw him to Bai Wanjie and said, \u201cThat is what you wanted. This transaction is complete.\u201d\n\nBai Wanjie picked up Han Sen with confusion and asked, \u201cWhy does he have black hair and black eyes? I wanted a bald guy in red robes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could have changed clothes and grew hair,\u201d Holy Pirate replied. \u201cBesides, there was only one xenogeneic in the Space Garden that met the defined criteria. If you can find another one that looks like this, you can have my head on a plate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I believe you, Holy Pirate.\u201d Bai Wanjie checked out Han Sen.\n\nBack then, he had only seen Han Sen bring the red-robed child to save the Flower Gods. He did not see any further details.\n\nAside from Han Sen\u2019s clothes and hair, he did look like the red-robed child. And, it was a xenogeneic body. Bai Wanjie was unable to tell that it was Han Sen and not the red-robed child he was after.\n\nBai Wanjie looked at Han Sen as he asked, \u201cAre you the red-robed child from the Space Garden?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at him coldly and did not speak.\n\nBai Wanjie frowned. He was going to do something, but Holy Pirate coldly said, \u201cYou guys may go now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Holy Pirate. I am going to leave.\u201d Bai Wanjie did not want to offend Holy Pirate. He was suspicious, but he still left with Han Sen.\n\nAfter they departed the planet, Bai Wanjie returned to his battleship and locked Han Sen inside a supergravity cabin.\n\nBai Wanjie looked at the monitor for a while, but he was still unable to confirm if Han Sen was or was not the red-robed child he had seen that day.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I have to return to King\u2019s Kingdom and try to read his memories to confirm his identity.\u201d Bai Wanjie did not bother interrogating Han Sen. That was unnecessary for him to do. There were many professionals in the Extreme King that could do that for him.\n\nHan Sen was worried Bai Wanjie would opt to torture him. If that happened, he was going to suffer a lot. After Bai Wanjie locked him in the supergravity cabin, he did not come back.\n\n\u201cI wonder when Holy Pirate will come to save me.\u201d Han Sen did not place all of his faith in Holy Pirate. If Holy Pirate was scared of the Extreme King, then he would be waiting for nothing.\n\n\u201cIf my body was ordinary, I could escape this mere supergravity cabin. It could not contain me.\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. His body\u2019s power was currently unavailable. He was unable to make use of anything.\n\n\u201cFortunately, I can still use beast souls. It is not like there are any other ways.\u201d Han Sen was still wondering if there was a way for him to escape.\n\nBefore Han Sen had the chance, they were already in King\u2019s Kingdom.\n\nThis was Han Sen\u2019s second time with the Extreme King, and he was filled with a bevy of emotions. He expected he would come back to the Extreme King again, but he thought he would only have done so as some sort of king. He would have dominated the Extreme King and kept them below his thumb.\n\nNo one expected he would be returning to the Extreme King as a prisoner. The skies were familiar there, and Han Sen could not help but sigh. \u201cI cannot believe this. This is a bad stroke of luck. I am the red-robed child\u2019s scapegoat, and I have been captured and brought to his Extreme King hellhole. Furthermore, I have no power.\u201d"
