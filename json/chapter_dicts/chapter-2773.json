    "text": "After the phoenix lifted Han Sen into the air, it rocketed forward with blinding speed. This was nothing like the slow, ponderous way the bird had moved when it first approached Two Ape Mountain.\n\nBefore Han Sen could say anything, he saw that they were heading toward one of the suns in the sky. The orb glowed with power and heat as they shot recklessly toward it.\n\nThey were still some distance from the sun, but Han Sen thought that the incredible heat was about to melt his deified body. He didn\u2019t know what would happen if he entered that glowing orb, and his heart rose into his throat at the thought.\n\nThe phoenix flapped its wings, and they shot past the sun, flying deeper into the xenogeneic space. The phoenix accelerated, leaving behind the glowing suns that hung threateningly in the sky. Han Sen looked ahead and saw, in the distant sky, a giant sycamore tree that was growing upside-down.\n\nHan Sen had seen many strange trees in his life before, but he had never seen a tree growing upside-down.\n\nThe top of the giant sycamore tree was on the ground, but its roots were growing into the sky. The roots were like a dragon\u2019s beard, all tangled up like a large bird nest.\n\n\u201cPeople say phoenixes live in sycamore trees. Perhaps this phoenix doesn\u2019t live atop the sycamore tree, but rather, in its roots.\u201d Han Sen looked at the upside-down growing tree with a strange expression.\n\nThe god phoenix soared up to the roots and landed deftly among them. The creature opened its beak, letting Han Sen fall into a knot of roots that looked something like a nest.\n\nHan Sen quickly discovered that the place wasn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d a bird\u2019s nest. It really was a bird\u2019s nest.\n\nIn that bird\u2019s nest that was composed of the roots of the tree, Han Sen saw a giant egg that was around ten meters tall. The egg was burning with the same white fire as the phoenix.\n\n\u201cWhy have you brought me here? You don\u2019t think I look like a phoenix, do you? You\u2019re not going to raise me as a child, are you?\u201d Han Sen spoke to the phoenix that was now settling down in the nest.\n\n\u201cOf course I know you aren\u2019t a phoenix. Phoenixes don\u2019t give birth to ugly children like you. And this, this is my child,\u201d the phoenix said proudly.\n\n\u201cThen why did you bring me here?\u201d Han Sen let out a long sigh. If he was raised by a phoenix, he would become a phoenix man.\n\n\u201cYour body has traces of a presence that belongs to a member of my race. And I must say, it is a nice one. I\u2019m sure you must have been spending a lot of time with a youngster of my race,\u201d the phoenix said while looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cA young phoenix?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Then he thought of something. With a weird look on his face, he said, \u201cShe can\u2019t be talking about the little red bird, can she? The little red bird is a hybrid, though. It isn\u2019t actually a phoenix.\u201d\n\nNow Han Sen understood why the phoenix was treating him differently. It was because of the little red bird.\n\n\u201cWe did spend time together for quite a while. And our relationship is solid. We are kind of like brothers,\u201d Han Sen said seriously.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t going to tell the phoenix that the little red bird was a hybrid. If the phoenix was racist to the hybrid kind, then his special treatment would vanish.\n\nThinking about how cold and cruel the phoenix appeared when it started eating people, Han Sen shuddered. He sincerely hoped the phoenix wouldn\u2019t have a change of heart and became callous enough to dine on him.\n\n\u201cI thought I was the only phoenix remaining in this universe. I didn\u2019t suspect there was another one of my kind out there in the universe.\u201d The phoenix looked very happy, but then it said, \u201cIf you can, I hope you will be able to help me. Bring that baby phoenix here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that might be rather difficult. I have been separated from the phoenix for quite a while, and I\u2019m not sure where it is right now\u2026 But don\u2019t worry. If you want to see it, I will do my best to find him and bring him to you. If you guys are seeking a reunion, I will do my best to make it happen. A reunion with your family will be a beautiful thing.\u201d Han Sen could see that the phoenix\u2019s expression was growing a little rigid, so he quickly tried to make his voice sound more positive and certain.\n\nThe phoenix looked very happy again. \u201cDon\u2019t just try your best. You must bring him here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will make sure to complete this request,\u201d Han Sen agreed. He wanted to trick the phoenix and leave that xenogeneic space as soon as possible.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if the phoenix could accept a hybrid. He wouldn\u2019t risk his safety or the little red bird\u2019s by actually bringing it there.\n\nThe phoenix seemed very happy. It extended one of its wings, and Han Sen saw a feather that looked very fiery and white fall through the air. The feather seemed to have a life of its own, and it flew before Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis phoenix feather is for you. It is my gift for you. If you complete my request, I will reward you with more,\u201d the phoenix said seriously.\n\n\u201cYou are so kind. I\u2019m more than flattered to receive this,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he grabbed the fire-wreathed feather in his hand. It was a true god class treasure. Even a mere feather from the phoenix would be wildly powerful.\n\nThe feather was pure white, almost transparent. The whole thing looked as if it was made of fire, but it wasn\u2019t like a fire that Han Sen couldn\u2019t touch. It was actually solid.\n\nThis fire feather was a small piece of an actual phoenix, but it was still only one meter long. When he held it in his hands, though, it looked like a flaming sword. Han Sen grinned widely. He could use the feather as a weapon.\n\nHan Sen was lacking a decent weapon right now. This fire feather was perfect for him. The longer he held it, the more he liked it.\n\n\u201cA fire element fire feather. This should be quite powerful,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He wasn\u2019t going to try out the sword there in the phoenix\u2019s nest, though.\n\nAfter he had examined the gift, Han Sen changed the subject. \u201cWhy are you looking for a baby phoenix? I think that the baby bird is substantially weaker than you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was speaking the truth. This phoenix had pure ancestry, and it was a born-deified xenogeneic. The little red bird was just a hybrid, and it had been very weak when it was born. Compared to a true god xenogeneic, it was 180,000 miles behind.\n\nThe phoenix sighed and said, \u201cBreeding is difficult for our race. There aren\u2019t many of us left, if there are any at all. Up until now, I haven\u2019t been able to find another of my kind. I can\u2019t believe there is a baby bird alive somewhere. For me and my race, this is great news. Once my child is born, they can become a couple. That way, they should be able to breed.\u201d\n\nHan Sen froze when he heard that. The phoenix wanted to use the little red bird as a breeding machine. It planned for the little red bird to make babies and repopulate the phoenixes.\n\n\u201cHang on, I don\u2019t even know if the little red bird is male or female,\u201d Han Sen thought. \u201cIf they are the same sex, how will they make babies?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t say that aloud, however. He only agreed to the request, promising that he would bring the little red bird there.\n\n\u201cIf there is nothing else, I will go and search for the little red bird and bring it here.\u201d Han Sen just wanted to get out of there now.\n\n\u201cThere is no rush. Before you leave, there is something very important you must do,\u201d the phoenix said. Then, it spat some fire at Han Sen."
