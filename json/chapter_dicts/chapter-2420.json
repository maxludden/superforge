    "text": "When Han Sen reached the control room, Miss Mirror, Red Cloud, and Night Wind were there staring at the rock through a monitor.\n\nThe stone had been locked inside a warehouse. No one was allowed to physically approach the warehouse, though. Whenever any creature approached the stone, something strange would happen.\n\nA deified elite had suddenly been reduced to a King. That was something that had never happened before.\n\nEven Red Cloud didn\u2019t know what had happened to her. She hadn\u2019t been injured, and she hadn\u2019t felt anything invade her body. It was as if she had fallen asleep and gone back in time to a point before she had become deified.\n\nAlthough she still had a deified mind and senses, her physical power and prowess had dropped to King class. It was a very unusual phenomenon.\n\nHan Sen heard what had happened, and when he looked at Red Cloud, he examined her carefully. He could see that Red Cloud\u2019s lifeforce had significantly lowered. When he had looked at her previously, the cloudy appearance that had shrouded her power was now gone. He could see her lifeforce clearly now. She was only a King, and she was weaker than Falling Leaf.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Miss Mirror asked Han Sen, indicating the stone.\n\nHan Sen looked at the stone displayed on the monitor, and he noticed that it looked like any ordinary block of stone. It was black, and it was roughly the size and shape of a man standing on his feet.\n\nIt was only a rough shape, though. There was no discernible face. The rough outline of limbs were connected to the body, so the stone was a single lump. It looked like something that might have been crudely hewn from a greater rock by primitive individuals with their primal tools.\n\nHan Sen knew it couldn\u2019t have been constructed, though. There was no evidence that it had been created by sentient beings.\n\nEven the symbols upon the stone man appeared to be naturally generated. They didn\u2019t look like carvings, at all.\n\nHan Sen observed it for a while, and he couldn\u2019t find anything unusual about it. He didn\u2019t know what any of the symbols upon it meant, either. He had never seen them before, and they weren\u2019t like the Kingese, which he could understand by instinct.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you anything just by looking at the video,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go to the warehouse to take a look?\u201d Miss Mirror asked, glancing at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIf you guys can\u2019t determine anything about this stone, then I definitely won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Han Sen said quickly. He wasn\u2019t really interested in taking an unnecessary risk.\n\nEven a deified had been reduced to King class overnight. Han Sen didn\u2019t want to have his level lowered, especially since he had only just become King.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s answer surprised Miss Mirror. She was silent for a moment, then said, \u201cThis news has spread all across King\u2019s Kingdom. My brother told me to keep it here and figure out what it is exactly.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t surprise Han Sen. If they sent it back to the Extreme King without figuring out what it was or how to control it, the stone could end up draining the power of all the deified Extreme King. Han Sen found the thought to be rather funny.\n\nNight Wind said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how effective this item is. We will have to use another creature to figure out the nature and effective radius of its ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen, didn\u2019t you want to work? I will let you handle this,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. This was too dangerous of an endeavor, so he had no intention of trying it out himself. He would just pick some workers to go for him.\n\nIt was surprising that Miss Mirror was actually letting Han Sen handle this, though.\n\n\u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d Miss Mirror inquired.\n\n\u201cNope. What people should I use, though?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cChoose some workers to go. There are many of them, but you can only select a maximum of ten Dukes. You can have ten Marquises, too,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Han Sen agreed.\n\n\u201cThen it is settled. Get to work, and I will await your good news.\u201d Miss Mirror smiled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my Lady. I will not disappoint you,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nWhen Han Sen left, Night Wind said, \u201cMy Lady, is it suitable for Prince Sixteen to be the one to handle this? If something happens to him, what will we say to the King?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can handle that. Now, Red Cloud has lost most of her power. You will have to be in charge of the stone field. Be careful,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nHan Sen went to the stone field and selected a few people, including Ning Yue. Although it was only a test, who knew how dangerous it could turn out to be.\n\nBecause Han Sen needed to confirm how effective the stone was, he would have to send people close to the stone. The closer someone was, the more danger they would be in. Han Sen planned to keep Ning Yue as far away from the stone as possible. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t be affected by the stone.\n\nIf the furthest person was affected, then everyone in the base was already in range of the stone. In that case, it wouldn\u2019t matter who was or wasn\u2019t participating in the tests.\n\nHan Sen put together his operation swiftly. He split his twenty nobles into ten pairs, one Marquise and one Duke per team. He instructed each team to stand at a different distance from the stone. The closest team to the stone was inside the warehouse. The other teams were outside the warehouse. He spaced the teams out at regular intervals, positioning Ning Yue far in the back.\n\nThen, all Han Sen needed to do was watch the changes unfold within the ten teams. High-level members of Spring Rain observed the proceedings, making careful records of everything that happened.\n\nAfter a single night, something occurred to the team that was nearest the stone, but it was different from what had happened with Red Cloud. They didn\u2019t drop a level. Instead, they leveled up.\n\nThe Marquise became a Duke, and the Duke became a King.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as much of a surprise as when Red Cloud was reduced to King class, but it was still shocking, all the same. Now everyone was curious if the stone could be used to level up beyond King. If they could use the stone to turn a King into a deified, that would be pretty wicked.\n\nEven if the stone couldn\u2019t level people up that far, bringing Dukes up to King class was exceptional. If he could use those powers safely, and there were no adverse side effects, Han Sen thought he could raise a King class army. That would be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t allow the two leveled up people to leave their position. They remained inside the warehouse, waiting for more changes to occur.\n\nBy the third day, no further changes were observed in the two people in the warehouse. The second team outside had been affected, though. Just like those of the first team, they had leveled up.\n\nEver since that rock had been found, all the creatures that touched it leveled up once. Only Red Cloud had been knocked down a peg.\n\nHan Sen went to check out the ten teams each and every day. He also had a chance to speak with Ning Yue. Han Sen found the experience to be chilling, though. Ning Yue was really girly. It wasn\u2019t just his body anymore; his personality had changed, too.\n\nHan Sen could scarcely believe that this was the Ning Yue he used to know. Ning Yue never used to be afraid of anything, but now he really was sensitive like a girl.\n\n\u201cI was affected by that sword.\u201d Han Sen would never forget Ning Yue\u2019s face when he said that. It was like a woman that had just been married, but her husband was killed immediately after. He looked so desperate and helpless; he was pitiful."
