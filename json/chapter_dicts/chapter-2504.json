    "text": "Han Sen followed Bao\u2019er\u2019s instructions when she told him where to look. Amidst that clump of mushrooms was a small clump of grass that didn\u2019t look particularly outstanding.\n\nThe grass was only three or four centimeters tall. It was very, very small, and it appeared rugged and yellow. It looked as if it had dried up and died. If Bao\u2019er hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have noticed it.\n\n\u201cYou want to eat that grass?\u201d Han Sen looked at Bao\u2019er with shock. And he thought to himself, \u201cSince when has Bao\u2019er changed her appetite? I thought she only ate sweets.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the grass. There is something below it,\u201d Bao\u2019er said quietly.\n\n\u201cBelow?\u201d Han Sen looked at the grass and instantly realized what she meant. The grass was probably similar to the greens of a carrot. The root of the plant was the useful part.\n\nHan Sen stopped hesitating and began using his Ghost Teeth Knife to cut a path to the tiny patch of grass. He swung his knife and cut down some of the toxic purple mushrooms.\n\nKing class xenogeneic plants were nothing to Han Sen. One life, one mushroom. He even cut down apart their roots.\n\nThe toxic mushrooms released their toxic mist, but Han Sen used an icy light to block it. Although the King class toxic mist was very strong, it couldn\u2019t harm Han Sen.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Toxic Umbrella Mushroom. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was a little bit surprised. The purple mushrooms really were xenogeneics, and they were King class, as well.\n\n\u201cIf Night River King\u2019s diary\u2019s coded creatures were toxic umbrella mushrooms, then that means something must have affected them. And that was why they became King class. That might also mean they weren\u2019t originally King class. But if this is so, what affected them? Could it be that wilted grass?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Toxic Umbrella Mushroom. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Toxic Umbrella Mushroom beast soul.\u201d\n\nOnce Han Sen had killed thirty of the mushrooms, he earned a King class beast soul. That was surprising.\n\nThe mushrooms were King class, and yet, they were unable to move. Their only talent was the ability to release toxic spores that were ineffective against someone like Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen quickly cleared the rest of them out and earned two Toxic Umbrella Mushroom beast souls.\n\nThat surprised Han Sen. They were weapon beast souls, but right now, Han Sen didn\u2019t have time to stop and give them a closer look.\n\nOnce all the mushrooms were gone, Han Sen used his knife to dig around the wilted grass. He wanted to see what lay below.\n\n\u201cDo you guys know what kind of plant that is?\u201d King Bai asked, looking at the Extreme King elites around him.\n\nEveryone could tell that Han Sen\u2019s objective was to dig out something that lay below, but they all looked confused. None of them knew what the grass was.\n\nEven the xenogeneic mushrooms Han Sen had killed were unknown to them. They had no clue what they were.\n\nMany plants were oh-so-very weird, all across the geno universe, so it wasn\u2019t strange that none of King Bai\u2019s attendants could identify the mushrooms. Even deified elites were unable to recognize all the plants that they encountered.\n\nBut they were confused, too. They didn\u2019t know how Han Sen had known there were xenogeneic plants just lying around in that precise spot.\n\nAs Han Sen kept slicing and dicing, digging through the ground, he saw something purple appear below. At first, he was unable to tell what it was. But after digging for a while longer, he was able to identify it.\n\nIt was a big carrot. The skin was purple, and the root was two feet long. There was also a purple beard on it.\n\nHan Sen dug out the giant carrot and gave it to Bao\u2019er. He curiously asked, \u201cBao\u2019er, since when have you enjoyed eating carrots?\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, even if we were at home, I\u2019m pretty sure this thing would be called ginseng.\u201d Bao\u2019er held the big carrot as she spoke to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cGinseng?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. That thing looked just like a carrot. How could ginseng be that large? And Han Sen remembered that ginseng looked yellowish. This thing was purple. It was a carrot, no matter what.\n\n\u201cThen treat it as a carrot.\u201d As Bao\u2019er fondled the massive ginseng, she looked very happy. She looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cDaddy, keep digging. I am sure you can find something else in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is something else?\u201d Han Sen kept on digging.\n\nThe cameras only had video. Ice Blue Knight King and the others of the Extreme King were unable to hear what was being spoken. They watched as Han Sen dug up a big carrot and gave it to Bao\u2019er to hold.\n\nKing Bai frowned. No one around him recognized what the big carrot was.\n\nThere were too many similar plants in the universe. If they weren\u2019t famous, there wasn\u2019t much of a chance of people remembering them. The purple carrot was the same as the mushrooms, in that it wasn\u2019t famous at all. No one had heard of them before.\n\nNow, they were very curious about what Han Sen could dig out of the ground there.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what he was about to dig up, either. He just used his Ghost Teeth Knife to keep digging. It looked as if there wasn\u2019t too much to be found. He dug another meter into the ground, but there didn\u2019t appear to be anything down there below the earth.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, are you sure there\u2019s something down here?\u201d Han Sen looked at Bao\u2019er with confusion.\n\n\u201cThere should be.\u201d Bao\u2019er was still holding the giant ginseng, sitting atop a rock.\n\nHan Sen kept on digging. He dug three meters into the ground before he felt the tip of his knife strike something.\n\nBecause the hole was too deep, the camera\u2019s position wasn\u2019t right, and the Extreme King couldn\u2019t film whatever was inside the hole.\n\nIce Blue Knight King and the others of the Extreme King could only see Bao\u2019er. She was sitting atop the hole with a carrot in her hand, with rocks and soil being flung out of the hole. But they couldn\u2019t see what was going on inside the pit.\n\nIf they were there, they could use many methods to see what was in the hole. But through video, no matter how smart they were, they couldn\u2019t tell what was going on below ground.\n\nHan Sen felt something down there. He dug faster as he grew more excited. It wasn\u2019t long before he revealed what was down there.\n\nHan Sen discovered that it was a shield. It looked like a tower shield. It was forged from purple metal, which was almost like some form of copper, but not quite. If he was honest with himself, he wasn\u2019t even sure if it was metal.\n\nThe inside of the shield was facing up, so Han Sen could see the handle. The styling of it was so old, and there weren\u2019t even any insignias on it. Han Sen grabbed the handle of the shield and lifted it.\n\n\u201cWhy is it so heavy? But then again, judging by the weight, it has to be something good.\u201d The shield was so heavy that Han Sen was having trouble holding it up. Still, he managed to get it out.\n\nBoom!\n\nHe had only just lifted the shield when, before he could see what was on the front of the shield, a purple light burst from the shield like a volcano. The light flashed up into the sky.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He raised his head and looked into the sky. In that purple light, there was a beautiful woman with a fantastic body and a snake tail."
