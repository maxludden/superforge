This was beyond their wildest dreams, though, and no expected Han Sen to be capable of achieving such a feat.\n\nHe had brought down an emperor-class shelter in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. Even in the super gene era, no one had believed it to be a remotely possible endeavor.\n\nIt was an emperor\u2019s shelter, and each and every person knew how difficult conquering one could be. News spread fast, and even those who were previously unlearned about the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary were informed of how powerful they were.\n\nMany people thought the tales were preposterous, at first. But Thunder Hell Emperor was infamous and widely renowned, so the news of his vanquishing was not something that could have been faked.\n\nThere were thirty people who had been rescued by Han Sen\u2019s heroic deed. The oldest of them was a fellow who was two hundred years old. The youngest had only been at the shelter for a year.\n\nThey were each able to prove that Han Sen had done what was being told, and they each spoke in great admiration as they retold what they had witnessed. Han Sen had indeed taken down Thunder Hell Shelter, and he had killed all the super creatures and king spirits that previously existed there with his posse.\n\nHuang Tianze used to hold a title, and he was oft referred to as the Father of Warframes. He had been missing for sixty years. Han Sen had rescued him.\n\nThe Alliance went crazy as the stories of Han Sen\u2019s effortless victory over an emperor shelter began to circulate.\n\nThe Alliance usually forbade the spreading of news regarding the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary due to how horrible the place was. Most humans had to endure great suffering when they entered the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and if this became widely known, many humans would be afraid of going. No progress would ever be made.\n\nIf that happened, humanity\u2019s hopes and dreams of eventually conquering the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary would be lost.\n\nIt might have been cruel to mislead people about the dire situation in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, but it was a necessary evil. If humanity wanted to become greater, they had no choice but to go and brave the howling dark, even if that meant they would not return.\n\nIf humanity became too afraid of the cost of becoming greater, it would only be a matter of time before they were beaten and one day eliminated.\n\nWhen the news was heard, the Alliance was taken by a Han Sen fever. Propaganda, spreading word of Han Sen\u2019s deeds, was everywhere.\n\n\u201cAn Emperor Shelter?! How did he do such a thing?\u201d Old Qin was shocked, hearing the news for the first time.\n\nZhao Seven was sad, on the other hand. They had Angel Gene, but they had yet to take even a single king-class shelter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be an adventuring partner of Han Sen, that is for sure!\u201d Son of God, Liu Meng, heard the news and wanted nothing more than to group up with him. But thinking of his old man, he knew he couldn\u2019t.\n\nTang Zhenliu said, \u201cIt has been quiet for so many years, hasn\u2019t it? And now, the mad lad has gone and conquered an Emperor Shelter!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary,\u201d Yi Dongmu said, hearing the news. Then, he left.\n\nLin Feng, reading the news, immediately went back to practicing.\n\nThe whole Alliance was in fervent discussion about Han Sen and what he had accomplished for humankind, and news about the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary was released to the masses.\n\nHan Sen had become a hero, but he didn\u2019t revel in the fanfare he was receiving. Currently, he was holding something far dearer to him, and his mouth drooled all the while.\n\n\u201cThey are all mine.\u201d Han Sen was holding a number of Life Geno Essences in his hand.\n\nBao\u2019er looked at him in disdain, and she ran out, looking for Zero.\n\nHan Sen was holding them all, kissing each of them in rapid succession.\n\nHan Sen had killed six super creatures, yielding six Life Geno Essences. Two of them had left flesh behind, and another had provided him a super beast soul.\n\nStill, none of the king spirits were willing to obey a new master. Three had been killed.\n\nHe was more than satisfied with what he had obtained from that daring conquest, though. And he was particularly happy with the beast soul he had managed to get.\n\nIt was a humanoid shapeshifting beast soul called Ancient Devil Soldier. It had armor and demon wings, which increased his power and speed. He could even fly with it. Furthermore, because it was humanoid, Han Sen was able to use the skills and hyper geno arts he had learned.\n\nHan Sen did not absorb the Life Geno Essences yet, and he shared the merry time with Ji Yanran.\n\nWhen Han Sen first went to the sanctuary, he wanted his family to improve and live a better life. Now, his goal was to simply become stronger. To learn the truths he also sought, Han Sen knew there were many areas he had to become even stronger in.\n\nJi Yanran told him, \u201cNow I really want to go to the sanctuaries. I want to be there with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. And what\u2019s more, I have no idea where you\u2019d spawn. But don\u2019t you worry, I will take down the whole of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary for you. Mom and Little Yan will also be able to go there without fear of unfair death and danger,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen knew full well how dangerous the sanctuary was. Merely going to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary was a risk, as spawning in the wrong shelter could leave you at the mercy of a spirit that didn\u2019t even want you.\n\n\u201cCan you really take down the whole sanctuary?\u201d Ji Yanran asked.\n\nHan Sen placed her on his lap and slapped her bum.\n\n\u201cWhy are you hitting me?\u201d Ji Yanran blushed.\n\n\u201cYou doubted my words, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Han Sen said, spanking her once more.\n\nSuddenly, the slaps became soft. Han Sen\u2019s hands turned to a gentle caress, like velvet. Then, they rode the heat of passion like a comet burning bright.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary as a gift for you,\u201d Han Sen said, at last.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen was resting at home, after that. When Ji Yanran came back, she dropped many cards in front of him.\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cReceipts. Many people from different planets came to our shop to buy aircraft, all because they desire your signature,\u201d Ji Yanran said.\n\n\u201cThat many?! How many aircraft did you sell?\u201d Han Sen was flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we can live the rest of our lives merrily, all with the money I made today.\u201d Ji Yanran paused to give a warm smile, then she said, \u201cMy Dad did tell you to prepare, though. The Alliance has created a new title called Super Aristocrat. You will be the first to receive it. And what\u2019s more, my father will present you with medals in Levo Plaza.\u201d"
