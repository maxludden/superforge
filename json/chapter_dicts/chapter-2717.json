    "text": "The godlights that came from the wolf\u2019s eyes shot toward Gru like four bolts of lightning. Gru remained stalwart, though. He had already prepared his defense, and when the four-eyed wolf unleashed the attack, Gru lifted his mirror shield.\n\nThe green godlights slammed straight into the mirror shield, but they were reflected away. The attack was unable to damage the shield, and as he watched, Han Sen felt a little bit jealous.\n\nBefore the four-eyed wolf could gather its power to attack again, Han Sen made his move. He immediately activated the ice geno art that he had recently received. Snowflakes crusted over his body, and he unleashed snow substance chains that headed straight for the four-eyed wolf.\n\nThe four-eyed wolf had just used its eye skills, so it didn\u2019t have much of a chance of avoiding the snowy substance chains. A new light flashed across its body as it tried to block the attack. The snowy air didn\u2019t seem to be affected, though. Han Sen\u2019s icy power wrapped around the four-eyed wolf. If seen from afar, it would have looked like a half-transparent snow lady covering up the giant wolf.\n\nThe snow power didn\u2019t immediately freeze the four-eyed wolf. The green light still shone around the wolf\u2019s body, and its substance chains fought against the snow power.\n\n\u201cIs that all the strength that this ice geno art can unleash?\u201d Han Sen was disappointed. This was similar to what he could do when he had his Apollo Set. The attack was nothing special, and the ice power wasn\u2019t very strong. It fell far short of his expectations, that was for sure.\n\nHe had only attacked once, and the ice geno core\u2019s power was already exhausted. He would have to wait a long time before he could even use it again, anyway. It wasn\u2019t as good as the Apollo Set, which was far more convenient. If this was all the ice geno core could accomplish, then there was no reason for him to continue practicing with the ice geno core. He could just keep on using his Apollo Set.\n\nThe snow air seemed to be growing a little more intense as time went on, but overall, the strike was unable to freeze the four-eyed wolf. Han Sen thought it was all over.\n\nAfter all, the four-eyed wolf had easily held off the attack. When the wolf summoned more of its strength, it would obliterate the snow power.\n\nBut things developed in an unexpected way. The four-eyed wolf\u2019s attempts to fight off the snow power did not increase. Instead, they weakened. And Han Sen\u2019s icy power affected the creature more and more.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. As he watched, the wolf\u2019s four eyes seemed to flutter. It looked very sleepy. The creature was going to fall asleep any second.\n\n\u201cDoes the ice power have a tranquilizing effect as well?\u201d Han Sen was happy about this.\n\nThe four-eyed wolf could block the ice, but it couldn\u2019t resist the lulling power. Its will began to fade. The green light became dimmer and dimmer. The creature couldn\u2019t break the ice power that held it captive.\n\nThe ice power wasn\u2019t a raging, destructive attack. It just lowered the target\u2019s body temperature. The wolf grew chillier, bit by bit. Not long after, the four-eyed wolf succumbed entirely to the sedative. It closed its eyes, went to sleep, and froze like an ice statue.\n\nGru was staring at the wolf in undisguised shock. He turned and looked at Han Sen for a long while before saying in an odd tone, \u201cThis is a very powerful ice geno art. It has already generated substance chains, too. Has that geno art reached a deified level\n\nHan Sen nodded. \u201cI got lucky when I received it. I managed to get my hands on a deified geno core, and fortunately, I was able to refine it and receive this ice geno art.\u201d\n\nGru was more interested. And he said, \u201cSo the power came from a deified geno core? Deified geno cores are so rare. Even the Extreme King count themselves incredibly lucky to lay claim to one, and even then, only deified elites can learn the deified geno arts that the cores offer. Your luck is too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nothing. With the powers of the Extreme King, I am sure Brother Gru will be able to get deified geno cores easily, right?\u201d Han Sen responded coldly.\n\n\u201cI would have trouble getting a deified geno care. And even if I somehow got one, I wouldn\u2019t be able to absorb it before becoming deified.\u201d After saying that, Gru fell silent. Then, he walked to the four-eyed wolf.\n\nNow that it was solidly encased in ice, the four-eyed wolf was soundly asleep. However, the freezing power hadn\u2019t actually killed the creature. It still had a lifeforce.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I will have to ask Brother Han to kill it,\u201d Gru said.\n\nHan Sen had no reason to refuse. If he used his Apollo Set, he should have a sufficient amount of power to strike down the four-eyed wolf. Plus, the creature could no longer move. It couldn\u2019t even generate a power to block Han Sen\u2019s attack.\n\nThe power of the Apollo Set was unleashed. Han Sen slashed toward the sleeping four-eyed wolf, cutting deeply into the side of the creature\u2019s neck.\n\nNo blood leaked from the wound, however. The blood was all frozen. Despite being attacked and badly injured, the four-eyed wolf didn\u2019t even wake up. Rather than howling in pain, it remained in a deep slumber.\n\nIt took Han Sen four slashes to cut the wolf\u2019s head off. Then, the four-eyed wolf\u2019s lifeforce disappeared.\n\n\u201cDeified xenogeneic killed: Four-Eyed Wolf. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ice geno art is so powerful. It has both ice and sedative powers? It is very good.\u201d Han Sen was happy with its performance. He was now thinking about refining the two fire geno cores he had received.\n\nGru complimented Han Sen\u2019s good luck in obtaining a new, powerful deified geno art. But he also looked annoyed, and he said. \u201cI wanted to see more of your knife skills, but it seems that I didn\u2019t get the chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see the knife skills whenever. Killing the xenogeneic is what matters. According to our deal, I\u2019m getting half of this four-eyed wolf\u2019s xenogeneic gene, right?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Gru said with a nod.\n\nHan Sen used his power to cut the four-eyed wolf in half. Each of them had half of the wolf\u2019s body to take home with them.\n\nOnce their hunt was finished, Han Sen went back to where the Immortal Dragon was trapped. He found it still lying there, unmoving. It was very afraid of the knife silks. Han Sen\u2019s silks seemed to have caused the creature a great deal of pain.\n\nHan Sen removed the knife silks. After Gru said his goodbyes, Han Sen took the Immortal Dragon back to the Star Tree.While there was no one around, Han Sen brought out the black crystal and fed it to the Immortal Dragon.\n\nThe Immortal Dragon didn\u2019t want to open its mouth, so Han Sen summoned more knife silks and cinched them tight around the creature. The knife silks dug painfully into the Immortal Dragon\u2019s body, and the beast couldn\u2019t help but scream. In doing so, it opened its mouth.\n\nHan Sen tossed the black crystal into the dragon\u2019s mouth. As soon as he saw the beast swallow, he released the knife silks.\n\n\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work on a xenogeneic, I will have to use it on a creature from the sanctuaries.\u201d Han Sen watched the beast lying flat on the ground. The creature seemed to have been utterly beaten down, body and soul.\n\nAfter two days, Han Sen saw something surprising happen. The scales of the Immortal Dragon began to fall off. And then, new scales appeared across its flesh. These scales were made of crystal. And, more importantly, substance chains began to rise from the scales.\n\nAlthough the substance chains weren\u2019t complete yet, it was a very clear sign.\n\n\u201cThe black crystal can really make the Immortal Dragon deified?\u201d Han Sen was as shocked as he was happy."
