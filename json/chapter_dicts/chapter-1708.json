It is their leftover genes,\u201d Old Cat said with a slight tone of\n\nawkwardness.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean there is more than one?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nOld Cat hesitated for a moment, and then said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Han Sen frowned. Old Cat wasn\u2019t answering fully and forwardly, and it was clear he was hiding something.\n\nOld Cat retreated into thought before speaking next. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big secret Only rare Nine-Life Cats can leave behind something like that. And to the best of my knowledge, there are only ten.\u201d\n\nHearing him say this, Han Sen\u2019s mind drifted back to Zero, who had the exact same thing. He still went on to ask, \u201cHow many are there in the sanctuaries?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one. It was from Human Emperor\u2026\u201d Old Cat suddenly stopped short.\n\nHan Sen heard half of what he said, and immediately, his face changed. He looked at Old Cat and asked, \u201cHuman Emperor visited the Nine-Life Cat? Nine-Life Cat comes from the outside, so the Human Emperor got out?\u201d\n\nOld Cat smiled and said, \u201cI guess, but he didn\u2019t go out with his powers intact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIf I told you I helped him out, you wouldn\u2019t believe me. So, it would be best if you stopped asking. And if you ever do make it out, you\u2019ll hear it from him. But if you can\u2019t make it out, such knowledge is useless to know,\u201d Old Cat said.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had no idea that an Alpha Human had made it out of the sanctuaries.\n\n\u201cIs he still alive, then? Can you at least tell me that?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. When I came here, he wasn\u2019t dead. But predicting if someone is dead or alive out there is now something anyone can do. Even me.\u201d Old Cat shook his head.\n\nHan Sen thought about this for a while and said, \u201cHow did you even get into the sanctuary? As far as I know, aside from the crystallizers, no others were able to get inside.\u201d\n\nThat was what concerned Han Sen the most. If the creatures from the outside could enter, just like Old Cat seemed to have, then that could spell out something pretty bad.\n\nOld Cat seemed to see through Han Sen\u2019s thoughts, and answered, \u201cIf nothing could get in, then how could Feathers be here?\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed. Old Cat, with a cocky expression on his face, went on to say, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, if the crystallizers hadn\u2019t killed themselves, it would have been difficult for other races to enter. I came in when the crystallizers opened the sanctuaries. And yes, the crystallizers are practically all dead. They can\u2019t kill themselves anymore to open doorways.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you destroy the crystallizers?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Old Cat.\n\n\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m capable of such an act?\u201d Old Cat revealed his claws.\n\nHan Sen ignored the mocking and asked him, \u201cWell, could other creatures have made it through?\u201d\n\nOld Cat nodded. \u201cThere were others, but I don\u2019t know them. Now come on, I\u2019ve told you everything you wish to know. Will you follow me now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what for? Maybe I\u2019ll consider coming.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cBreaking a promise made to the Nine-Life Cat isn\u2019t a very wise move to make. Think about it.\u201d Old Cat squinted his eyes.\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019d consider coming along. I didn\u2019t say I\u2019d come or not come.\u201d Han Sen smiled again.\n\nOld Cat was a professional liar, and Han Sen wasn\u2019t willing to put absolute stock into everything he was being told. And right now, there was every chance he might be getting sold out.\n\nOld Cat saw that Han Sen really wasn\u2019t moving, so he went on to explain the ruins.\n\nOld Cat had discovered another lab with another race there. It hadn\u2019t woken up like the Feather had, but just in case, he wanted to bring Han Sen for help.\n\nOld Cat explained that if nothing happened, he would take the item. If something bad happened, then any treasures they found would be shared.\n\nHan Sen asked him what he expected to find, but the cat\u2019s explanation made no sense to him. It was like some sort of bone that was similar to the one Han Sen retrieved before.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point in getting such a bone?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t figure out what that other bone was for, so now was as good a time to ask as any.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re useless in the sanctuaries, but out there, they\u2019re highly sought after by all. If you can get out, you\u2019ll find out for certain.\u201d Old Cat didn\u2019t really explain anything.\n\nHan Sen mulled the idea over some more, but ultimately decided to follow. He was quite curious about discovering another race, anyway.\n\n\u201cSo, do the sanctuaries only have one of these items, brought here by Human Emperor?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt should be just one, assuming Human Emperor did not lie,\u201d Old Cat said.\n\nHan Sen asked Old Cat how Human Emperor had managed to get the bone, but he didn\u2019t receive an answer. Old Cat was afraid of telling him.\n\nHan Sen was planning on going alone, but Xie Qing King overheard them and wanted to go along. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t mind some extra help, and Xie Qing King was nearing Emperor status, too. He\u2019d be very good to have along.\n\nBut before setting out, Han Sen returned to the Alliance. He took the glove, but left the crystal shoes for Ji Yanran in case something happened during his absence.\n\nThe three of them entered the relics Han Sen had been to before. Han Sen thought the lab was the one he had previously visited, with the Feather inside. But even though Nine-Life Cat was taking them to the same ruins, that was not the lab they were headed for.\n\n\u201cWhere did you find this thing?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cThere are three other labs, and I found what I seek in one of the others. I know my way around, and if it doesn\u2019t wake up like the Feather did, we should be safe.\u201d Old Cat spoke as he led them forward.\n\nThey walked around the ruins for a while before reaching their destination. When they entered, it looked just like the one Han Sen had previously visited. There were many tools and crystal tanks.\n\nThe laboratory was damaged, though. The room was in bad shape, and much of the equipment was broken. Many crystal tanks had broken, too, leaking their fluids everywhere. There were a number of rotten bodies and bones scattered all about."
