    "text": "Once he had agreed to go with Meng Lie, Han Sen pretended to be the perfect picture of subservience. He followed along as if he had no interest in escaping. As Meng Lie headed through the Tianxia System toward the Extreme King worlds, Han Sen trailed after him without any reluctance.\n\nMeng Lie wasn\u2019t worried about Han Sen trying to run off, but after they had traveled for a short while, a lot of cloud beasts began to attack from the surrounding clouds.\n\nMeng Lie dealt with those cloud beasts easily, and not even the King class cloud beasts were a threat to him. However, his face grew increasingly serious as time progressed.\n\nHe still had no idea who was sending all these cloud beasts after him. He felt like something was watching him, and he didn\u2019t enjoy that sensation at all.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. \u201cThe same thing happened to me when I was in the sea of creamy clouds. Even weak cloud beasts charged toward me with no concern for their own lives. From what I can tell, the effect must have a radius of sorts. When the spider plant and the black cricket enter a location, the cloud beasts from that region are drawn toward them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFourth Uncle, did you kill Lando?\u201d Han Sen asked after Meng Lie killed another horde of cloud beasts.\n\nMeng Lie wasn\u2019t in a good mood. He casually said, \u201cThat kid is a brutal fighter. I wasn\u2019t interested in risking my life fighting him, so I just ditched him instead. But don\u2019t think that he\u2019ll be coming to save you. He was drawn in another direction, so he won\u2019t be able to find us for quite some time.\u201d\n\nHan Sen never thought Lando would die; he just wanted to find out where the Dragon might have been. Hearing this did bring him a bit of relief, though.\n\n\u201cYou must be kidding, Uncle. I have already promised you that I will go to the Extreme King. Even if Lando was right here, I wouldn\u2019t go with him. It\u2019s just as you said; if this situation isn\u2019t sorted out, I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life hounded and scared. Not even making it to Sky Palace will protect me from that. So, I am sincere about my willingness to go back. But you must also keep your promise to ensure my life,\u201d Han Sen said, looking as earnest as possible.\n\nWhen the Meng Lie heard Han Sen say this, he felt a bit better. He nodded and said, \u201cYou are quite smart. If you work for the Extreme King with full dedication, I will keep you alive. But Han Sen must still die, so you will no longer be able to use your real name. We cannot let anyone know you are still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand. I don\u2019t mind losing my name if that\u2019s what it takes to survive. But\u2026\u201d Han Sen looked worried.\n\n\u201cBut what?\u201d Meng Lie asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that someone powerful might not want me to work for the Extreme King. They would rather kill me than let me follow you back.\u201d Han Sen injected a liberal dose of fear into his voice.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as you follow me, I won\u2019t allow anyone to bring you harm,\u201d Meng Lie declared.\n\nBut what Han Sen said did put Meng Lie on alert. Meng Lie was sure that some powerful figure was sending these clouds beasts after them, but that person had yet to reveal themselves. The mysterious deified just kept sending wave after wave of cannon fodder after them. If the mysterious deified was unable to steal Han Sen, then he might decide to just kill Han Sen instead.\n\nAfter a few more waves of cloud beast hordes assaulted them, Meng Lie was able to confirm his worry. The King class xenogeneics seemed to be aiming for Han Sen, in particular.\n\nAs he realized this, Meng Lie grew even more cautious. He pulled Han Sen closer to him, just in case something bad happened.\n\nWhile they were traveling, Meng Lie\u2019s face suddenly changed. He pulled Han Sen to a stop and looked deep into the clouds.\n\nHan Sen stood behind Meng Lie and also looked ahead. The nearby clouds were in turmoil as shockwaves rolled through them. A purple kirin was thundering toward them through the clouds.\n\nSubstance chains swirled around the monster\u2019s body life clouds.\n\n\u201cDeified xenogeneic! The spider plant and black cricket must be incredibly important if they can attract deified xenogeneics,\u201d Han Sen thought in astonishment.\n\nAnd there were many cloud beasts following the deified kirin to boot. There was a whole host of King class xenogeneics in their midst.\n\nMeng Lie frowned and spoke to Han Sen. \u201cDon\u2019t get too close to the battleground, but don\u2019t run off too far, either. If you get into a bad situation too far from where I\u2019m fighting, I might not have a chance to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle. I truly want to go to the Extreme King with you. I would never dream of running away.\u201d Han Sen knew what Meng Lie really meant, and so he answered him with sincerity.\n\nMeng Lie nodded. He started to say something more, but the deified kirin cut him off with a roar. It brought a sky of clouds toward them. The cloud beasts\u2019 target was fairly obvious, though. It was Han Sen they wanted.\n\n\u201cHuh? I want to see what sort of person is trying this hard to keep me from bringing Han Sen back to the Extreme King alive,\u201d Meng Lie said with narrowed eyes. He turned into a gold giant and ran toward the kirin.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t flee. Instead, he entered the fight with the horde of cloud beasts.\n\nAt this point, Han Sen had no reason to run. He was carrying some dangerous goods that could attract deified xenogeneics. Now that he had Meng Lie to take the heat for him, running away would mean leaving behind his protection.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that spider plant and black cricket are, but they can attract deified xenogeneics. If things get too bad, I\u2019ll just have to throw them away. There is no point in risking my life to keep them. At least for now, though, I can use them to my advantage. If they can keep attracting deified xenogeneics, Meng Lie will have a tough time trying to escort me out of here\u2026\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he began killing cloud beasts.\n\nMeng Lie engaged the kirin, but he remained focused on how Han Sen was doing. When he saw that Han Sen had also started to fight instead of running off, it surprised him, and it actually brought him some relief.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s sincere about following me back to the Extreme King. But that makes sense, I guess. Someone wants to kill him, and he will die if he doesn\u2019t come with me. Coming with me at least gives him a chance to live.\u201d Meng Lie nodded. As he watched the cloud beasts swarm around Han Sen like mad, he became quite angry. Someone wanted to kill Han Sen and keep him from working for the Extreme King.\n\nMeng Lie wouldn\u2019t have dreamed that the cloud beasts would be drawn straight to Han Sen.\n\nHow could Han Sen, who was just a King, invoke the ire of a deified xenogeneic? Even if Han Sen attracted them, they should have attacked Meng Lie first. But these xenogeneics seemed obsessed with killing Han Sen, despite the deified opponent in the same area. That was why Meng Lie believed there had to be some mastermind hidden somewhere nearby. This mysterious person clearly wanted to prevent Han Sen from being taken back to the Extreme King.\n\nMeng Lie was a brother of the Extreme King\u2019s ruler. He was an old, scary deified. Even if he had lost his Extreme Purple Demon Dragon, it was unlikely that another deified could kill him.\n\nAlthough Meng Lie was slowly fighting back the kirin that was surrounded by clouds, it would still take a long time for him to kill the creature.\n\nHan Sen made use of his movements to go around the cloud beasts he fought. He used this opportunity to wipe out several King class xenogeneics. He was quite pleased to have earned more King class xenogeneic genes.\n\nHan Sen moved through the xenogeneic hordes, using the Purple-Eye Butterfly to check on Meng Lie. If he got the chance, he might be able to attack at the right time and get a deified beast soul out of all this, too. That would be splendid.\n\nBut killing a deified being wasn\u2019t that easy. If Meng Lie still had his Extreme Purple Demon Dragon, he could have killed another deified relatively quickly. But since he had lost his Extreme Purple Demon Dragon, he had to exhaust his own power. Killing the deified kirin wouldn\u2019t be an easy task for him."
