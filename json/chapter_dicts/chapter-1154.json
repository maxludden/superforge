And simmering beneath the surface of that innocent image was an untold power.\n\nAnd startlingly, the face was familiar to Han Sen. He knew of a person who\u2019s face looked exactly like the one on the coin. It took a while for him to remember her image, due to him having only seen this woman once.\n\nWhen the Empty Witch ascended to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, a spirit escorted her through the door that manifested in the air.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s remembrance of that spirit\u2019s face was a little woozy. A lot had been going on when he saw her, and it was a very long time ago. So, even though his memory of it was fuzzy at first, it was now coming back to him.\n\nStaring at the coin intently, Han Sen couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it really was her. The resemblance, at least, was uncanny.\n\nShe had also left the mark of a lotus on Han Sen\u2019s forehead, but it was destroyed by Dragon King. Dragon King told Han Sen that he had been marked by the Lotus Empress.\n\n\u201cThis must be her. It has to be! It has to be the Lotus Empress!\u201d Han Sen was firm in this belief. He wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure, but he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else it could have looked like.\n\nHan Sen looked around, wondering if there was anything else worth taking, but there wasn\u2019t.\n\nProper currency was worthless in the sanctuary, so coins must have been forged by the Alliance. But the hardest material in the Alliance was z-steel alloy, and it wasn\u2019t as sturdy as the material used to craft the coin.\n\nThe coin had been retrieved by the creature from below the earth, so it was also quite puzzling why it had been buried in the soil of such a random location.\n\nHan Sen had been rattled by this discovery, and it made him a whole lot more curious about the creature that had initially collected the coin. But alas, Han Sen had been lost in thought for some time, and he hadn\u2019t paid attention to how long he had been down there.\n\nHan Sen was afraid the little creature could show up any second.\n\nHe went over to hide beneath the garbage. There was a mighty shield amidst the junk, and it was perfect for him to hide behind. He masked his scent and clutched Taia tightly.\n\nHan Sen was planning to wait until the creature returned, and when it did, assassinate it.\n\nIt was a super creature, and if he was able to insta-kill it through assassination and forego the need for a drawn-out fight, that\u2019d be a mighty swell thing indeed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Han Sen started to hear sounds coming from further up the cave. They were the sounds of the creature, on its way back down as predicted.\n\nHan Sen made sure his scent was hidden. Then, he went into a state of focus, ensuring the hand that held the sword was firm but relaxed and ready to strike.\n\nTo perform the strongest assassination strike, your body had to be relaxed. It was something he had practiced extensively during his time in the First God\u2019s Sanctuary. He was very proficient in the ways of the assassin.\n\nNot too much later, Han Sen felt the little creature approach.\n\nHe could sense something scraping against the ground, and this made Han Sen think the creature was bringing a bigger item along with it.\n\nHan Sen did not very much care what the little blighter was carrying with him; he just remained focused, preparing to strike. And the closer the creature got, the more relaxed Han Sen became.\n\nA noise rung out, sounding like the creature had chucked the latest scrap of junk onto the garbage pile.\n\nHan Sen could see every movement and motion made by the creature, all through his mind\u2019s eye. He could sense it all without the need for his true naked eyes.\n\nWhen the item landed on the heap, that was the time for him to strike. And so he did; Han Sen leaped out from behind the shield with Taia, ready to plunge Taia deep into the witless super creature that was none-the-wiser.\n\nHis heart and kidneys pumped fast, as his entire body began to glow red.\n\nHan Sen knew he was performing the perfect strike, as expected. Nine gene locks of the Blood-Pulse Sutra and Taia made for a lethal combination. Super creatures would do well to fear such a combo.\n\nThe creature turned around, but Han Sen still had his eye on the prize. Being so fast and so accurate, he thought he had ticked all the boxes, and he was more than ready to see Taia plunge through the creature\u2019s throat. There was no chance the creature could react in time.\n\nDong!\n\nThe sword was aiming for the neck with pinpoint accuracy, but before a connection was made, the scales of the creature lit up with a bright green light.\n\nAn aura of light suddenly enveloped the little beast, as if it was encased in a tight bubble of impenetrable protection. The creature was sent flying, but it was dealt no harm. The creature escaped the assassination attempt unscathed.\n\n\u201cA super creature with defensive powers, huh?\u201d Han Sen was quite shocked. But while the creature was still airborne, Han Sen drew his Phoenix Sword.\n\nDong!\n\nThe Phoenix Sword was incapable of penetrating the creature\u2019s green shield.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d Han Sen used all his power to repeatedly strike the creature, keeping it airborne amidst a flurry of hits.\n\nThe Phoenix Sword and Taia beat against the shield non-stop.\n\nThe shield looked like a balloon under fire, as if it\u2019d break any second.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen batted the creature into a wall, and before it could recover, pounced on the creature like a madman. With another barrage of strikes, Han Sen went to town on the creature.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need super king spirit mode to kill a super creature!\u201d Han Sen was insanely excited.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d Han Sen was shouting as he slashed, and eventually, the green bubble shield shattered into a faint haze of dust.\n\nWithout the shield, the creature was naked and helpless. It was like a little lamb, prepared for slaughter.\n\nBut before Han Sen slew the creature, he froze in place.\n\n\u201cAw, I was just playing games with you.\u201d Han Sen suddenly looked incredibly kind and gentle, and he brought his hand down to stroke the creature.\n\nHan Sen slowly turned around, and that was when he saw a number of giant creatures behind him. They all stared at Han Sen with menacing eyes."
