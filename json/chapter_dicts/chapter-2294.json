    "text": "Crime swung his weapon, and the substance chain on his knife became a black snake king that looked as if it could swallow the sky. It suddenly lashed towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body surged with power, but the white rope tightened around him. The mysterious substance chain tangled him up, and it made it difficult for Han Sen to gather up any semblance of defense. That knife was going to slice him to ribbons.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth. He was preparing to activate his super god spirit mode when the roaring knifelight was broken.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He looked at Crime. A hand that looked like jade had wrapped around Crime\u2019s wrist. The fingers were very long and pretty.\n\n\u201cMister White!\u201d Han Sen could not believe what his own eyes were seeing. Mister White was standing behind Crime, pulling his hand back through Crime\u2019s chest.\n\nBut Mister White\u2019s hand emerged perfectly clean, without a speck of blood dirtying it.\n\nCrime\u2019s broken knife fell to the ground. He looked at the bloody hole in his chest and then looked at Mister White with disbelief. He said, \u201cYour power was said to be useless in a fight\u2026 How\u2026 How were you able to destroy my black lion body?\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is full of surprises. You should have gotten used to that by now.\u201d A beautiful white shell appeared in Mister White\u2019s hand. He opened it and held it out toward Crime. The injured Crime was sucked into the shell.\n\nWhen the shell closed up, Mister White pocketed it. He grabbed the Sky Net and the little box. He looked as if he was smiling, but he wasn\u2019t. And to Han Sen, he said, \u201cHan Sen, it looks like you have lost completely.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was still bound by the Sky Net. He gave Mister White a wry smile. \u201cYou won. So, what are you going to do with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cKill you, of course. Do you really think I\u2019d let a scary enemy like you continue to live and grow in this world?\u201d Mister White looked at Han Sen emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cMister White, you overestimate me. I am just a nameless soldier.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t move. He summoned all his power as he continued to stare at Mister White. He was going to take a risk.\n\nMister White turned to the cat statue as he gripped the Sky Net, ignoring Han Sen and Bao\u2019er. \u201cNine-Life Cat, can we go now?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Mister White knew the jade cat statue was a Nine-Life Cat.\n\nThe Nine-Life Cat statue stared at Mister White. It remained unmoving as it coldly said, \u201cIf you guys passed the test, so it is entirely up to you whether you come or go. There is no need to ask for my permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Mister White tugged the Sky Net and dragged Han Sen and Bao\u2019er out of Holy Town.\n\nThis time, the power of the town didn\u2019t prevent them from leaving. Mister White pulled Han Sen and Bao\u2019er out of the town with ease and returned to that area of dark water.\n\nMister White\u2019s other hand glowed with holy light as it held the jade stone box. The light was able to keep the darkness at bay, at a distance of around three meters from them. He eventually pulled Bao\u2019er and Han Sen safely out of the trench.\n\nHan Sen had thought Mister White would kill them in Holy Town, but he didn\u2019t. And after he left that place, he didn\u2019t try to make a quick getaway. He took Han Sen and Bao\u2019er into the big white whale, instead.\n\nFox Queen and Yisha\u2019s fight seemed to have ended, since there was no more movement in the sea. It was unclear which of the two might have emerged victorious, though. There was no sign of either of them.\n\nMister White brought Han Sen and Bao\u2019er into the big white whale. He smiled and looked at Han Sen. \u201cNow I can kill you without any worries. Have you thought up any escape ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill me in Holy Town?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\n\u201cYou really think that town hid the real treasure?\u201d Mister White asked in an amused tone.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt could have, but only if the Sacred Leader went mad. It would have taken utter insanity to spend so much power and effort constructing a place to hide his own treasure.\u201d Mister White smiled. \u201cThis place must have a secret that you haven\u2019t even imagined yet. Aside from that, the picture on your back looks pretty special.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the drawing was gone.\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\nMister White laughed and said, \u201cYou are too naive. Just because something disappears, that doesn\u2019t mean it is gone. I didn\u2019t recognize the person who drew on you, but I do know that he was drawing a creature known as Ancient Blood Dragon Lady. It is a mutant, deified xenogeneic. Her blood is her mutant xenogeneic gene. I don\u2019t think such powerful blood could disappear so easily.\u201d\n\nHan Sen heard this and was shocked. He had never thought that thing might have been a mutant deified creature.\n\n\u201cWhy? Why did he draw on me?\u201d Han Sen asked in confusion.\n\n\u201cI do not know. Perhaps ever since the beginning, you were the chosen one.\u201d Mister White\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I am going to kill you, so everything will end.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Mister White looked angry. He yanked the Sky Net, and Han Sen and Bao\u2019er were pulled in front of him. His hand reached out to grab Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen remembered how Crime\u2019s body was easily perforated by Mister White\u2019s hand. He was shocked, and he was about to activate his super god body.\n\nBut when Mister White waved his hand, the Sky Net loosened enough to release the bird\u2019s nest. The bird\u2019s nest returned to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMister White, this is\u2026\u201d Han Sen caught the bird\u2019s nest, and he looked at Mister White with confusion.\n\nMister White put away the Sky Net, and he tossed the jade box towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen caught the little jade box, his confusion growing. He had no idea what was going on.\n\nMister White smiled at Han Sen. His muscles and bones began to shift and writhe, and so too did his face.\n\nNot long after, Mister White became someone else. His presence was greatly changed.\n\nMister White now looked younger. He looked no more than twenty years old, but his body carried a special sort of presence. It gave Han Sen the feeling that this man had seen and lived through everything. He was like a person that oversaw a match of chess. Han Sen\u2019s mouth opened wide.\n\n\u201cYou! How is it you!\u201d Han Sen screamed, pointing at him.\n\n\u201cWhy would it not be me?\u201d Mister White looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you in the sanctuaries? How\u2026 how did you get out\u2026\u201d Han Sen spoke only half of what he wished to. He then suddenly thought of Blood Legion and the shura, who both had a way to leave. It now didn\u2019t seem so strange that this person had been able to leave the sanctuaries.\n\n\u201cIt is a long story. To summarize, I thought I\u2019d be able to break the vacuum and become a god in this world. But who knew that this was the place I would actually come to. It was quite a disappointment, all-in-all.\u201d Mister White shrugged, looking regretful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 I cannot believe it\u2026\u201d Han Sen mumbled, still frozen.\n\nHan Sen knew this man. They hadn\u2019t spent much time together, but Han Sen remembered him. That was because this man was the real heir of the Xuan Men. But Han Sen had only learned the Dongxuan Sutra from Dongxuan Zi. That counted for half of the Xuan Men students."
