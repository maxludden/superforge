He wanted to flee the valley, and he believed with his super armor and super king spirit mode active, he could still manage that much.\n\nHe had been unable to slay the transparent scorpion, and that was partially due to his inability to see the foe. He knew he\u2019d have to figure out a way to see it before he returned to try again.\n\nBefore Han Sen was able to escape the valley, though, he very clearly heard the sound of something cracking. And then, something falling to the ground.\n\nWhen Han Sen took a look at what he had heard, he saw a broken blue eggshell on the ground. It was very brittle and very close to opening entirely.\n\n\u201cThe blue metal dinosaur has finished its evolution now?!\u201d Han Sen was shocked, and scrambled to pick it back up.\n\nEven if the dinosaur was a super creature, though, Han Sen did not believe it could effectively deal with the scorpion.\n\nBefore he could pick up the metal egg, though, a sharp pain struck into his back. It pushed him forward, throwing him through the air until he came crashing into a rocky wall that erupted into a plume of ruined stone, sand, and haze.\n\nPang!\n\nAn invisible power trampled the egg, shattering it.\n\nThe sight of that made Han Sen incredibly angry. He had waited a long time for the egg to hatch, and when it was finally about to, it was mercilessly slain underfoot.\n\nIf he could see the scorpion, he\u2019d unleash his most furious barrage of attacks he had ever performed and slice it up into mincemeat.\n\nBut of course, he still could not see it. So, he still had to make an escape his priority.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang!\n\nHan Sen heard a clanging noise behind him, and when he turned to look, he saw an invisible power repeatedly strike the spot where the eggshell lay shattered. A hole was formed in the ground that was stomped on, over and over again.\n\nBut strangely, the vision of blue began to expand until it claimed the shape of a blue metal dinosaur.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t killed?\u201d Han Sen was given a single moment of happiness amidst this grueling ordeal.\n\nThe blue dinosaur expanded in size until it was three meters in height. It looked incredibly heavy and monstrous.\n\nThe body of the beast was so tall and heavy, it looked indestructible.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong!\n\nHan Sen could make out the fact the stinger was repeatedly striking the dinosaur. It may have been able to deal damage to Han Sen through his armor, but it was largely ineffective against the sturdy metallic hide of the dinosaur.\n\nThe blue dinosaur, unfortunately, was unable to see the scorpion just like Han Sen. When it got hit, it began to roar and run around helplessly in pursuit of the invisible aggressor.\n\nFortunately, though, the scorpion seemed to occupy itself with the dinosaur exclusively. It let Han Sen be. The dinosaur was knocked down by the repeated scorpion strikes, but each and every time it was hit, it got back up.\n\n\u201cThe dinosaur is slow, and its power may only be decent, but boy oh boy\u2014it\u2019s a tank!\u201d Han Sen knew he did not have much time to stay and admire his new pet, though.\n\nSuper king spirit mode only lasted an hour, and so he had to leave soon.\n\nHan Sen was going to command the blue dinosaur to leave alongside him, but the dinosaur roared again. And then, a blue horn sprouted from its forehead. And as if they were bright light bulbs, the eyes flashed.\n\nPang!\n\nA wretched force whacked the dinosaur and made it collapse on the ground, a deep mark etched across its hide.\n\nBut the light bulb eyes then fixed themselves in a certain direction, and then they followed something.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang!\n\nHan Sen heard more noises, as more and more wounds began to manifest across the dinosaur\u2019s body. But all that time, the eyes were fixed on something.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t balls! Can it actually see the scorpion?\u201d Han Sen was shocked at this revelation.\n\nThen, the blue dinosaur moved. It moved its arms forward as if it was hugging nothing at all. It was still receiving blows, but the dinosaur managed to open its mouth and bite down on something that didn\u2019t seem to be there. The maw of the blue dinosaur would not completely shut.\n\nThe scorpion had been bitten. It was maddened, and it unleashed a barrage of pincer snaps and stinger strikes at the dinosaur. The dinosaur was strong, but not strong enough to withstand all of those attacks. Eventually, it began to bleed blue blood.\n\nThe mouth of the beast was bleeding due to one particular hit.\n\nBut still the mouth of the dinosaur was clamped down on something, and it refused to let go.\n\nHan Sen stopped running. He held a single coin between his fingers, as a number ticked up.\n\nThe scorpion acknowledged what Han Sen had cooking, and it wanted to free itself to prevent the terrible power that was about to befall it.\n\nAnd whether or not it was aware of what was going on, the dinosaur just didn\u2019t let go. The scorpion was trapped in place, no matter how it tried to squirm its way free.\n\n\u201cHold on\u2026 hold on\u2026\u201d Han Sen said to himself, as the coin quivered and shone with a cruel power.\n\n\u201cSeven, eight, nine.\u201d As the numbers ticked up, the appearance of that coin looked scarier and scarier.\n\nThe scorpion knew about the danger, and it repeatedly stung the dinosaur in a bid to loosen its jaws and escape.\n\nThe stings were awful, though. They were wickedly powerful, and the dinosaur had to loosen its grip to scream a little every time.\n\nAnd with that small amount of leeway, the scorpion was able to escape the dinosaur\u2019s metal maw. But unfortunately for it, it was still gripped in place by the dinosaur\u2019s talons.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d Han Sen could not wait any longer, so he fired his coin towards where the scorpion had to have been."
