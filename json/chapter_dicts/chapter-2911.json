    "text": "This bird had four wings and was very big. Its feathers were very long, especially those on its back. They were like a stream of knives on the creature\u2019s back, reminiscent of a waterfall.\n\nIt had nine small necks and nine bird heads. It looked like a phoenix. Its small feathers were like small blades. It was very white and very murderous.\n\nThis strange, murderous nine-headed bird emerged from the rainbow. The two parts of the tablet were gone from the ground. Rainbow rain poured down on the weird bird.\n\nIts four wings flapped. Its knifelike feathers made \u201ckatcha-katcha\u201d noises. The sounds were like knives and swords colliding against one another.\n\n\u201cThis is the true god xenogeneic Ghost Car!\u201d a primitive deified screamed.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had heard the name of the Ghost Car xenogeneic before. Some people said the Ghost Car had phoenix blood. Some people said Ghost Car was a murderous bird, and wherever it went, chaos followed in its wake.\n\nThat was not the reason Han Sen had heard of Ghost Car before. In the legends, one of Sacred\u2019s four holy beasts was Ghost Car. That was where Han Sen had heard its name before.\n\nIn the legends, Ghost Car had black feathers. This one had white feathers like knives. It was a stone element. It had absorbed Han Sen\u2019s Under the Sky Knife light, which was why it looked how it did.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThis is a weird xenogeneic. I cut it in half, yet it did not die. Instead, it turned into the Ghost Car xenogeneic. What if I killed this thing again? Would it turn back into a stone tablet?\u201d\n\nThe Ghost Car flew around Han Sen. It did so three times before stopping in front of him. It raised its head and squawked. Nine voices broke the sky and universe. It was like 10,000 knives moaning together.\n\nAfter the scream, Ghost Car put away its four wings. Its body and nine bird heads leaned forward. It was like it was obeying Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCan I bring this bird out of God Area?\u201d Han Sen tried opening the God Area door to take the Ghost Car outside of God Area.\n\nBecause ordinary creatures could only use their own God Area door to enter the God Area, the creatures in God Area could not open a God Area door to leave.\n\nIf Ghost Car was unable to leave the God Area with Han Sen, it was pointless for Han Sen to keep it around.\n\nHan Sen did not expect Ghost Car would follow him out of the God Area door back to Space Garden.\n\nHan Sen thought it might be because Ghost Car absorbed Under the Sky Knife power. It was very curious.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! Where did this murderous bird come from?\u201d Upon seeing Ghost Car, Wang Yuhang was shocked. Ghost Car stared at him with raised feathers. It was scary. It was like a mountain of knives.\n\n\u201cIt is a pet I just claimed,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile. \u201cIt looks good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cPet? What level?\u201d Wang Yuhang stared at Ghost Car.\n\n\u201cTrue god,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\n\u201cYou and your family get all of the luck in the world for yourselves. You just went out there and came back with a true god xenogeneic pet.\u201d Wang Yuhang looked very envious and jealous.\n\n\u201cCome. Let me ride it and see what it feels like to ride a true god.\u201d Wang Yuhang got close to Ghost Car, which made Ghost Car mad. Its knifelike feathers shone. Snow white knife lights were like a galaxy rising upon him. It covered the sky, ground, and the entirety of Space Garden.\n\nWang Yuhang was frightened and fell back. He waved his hands and said, \u201cNo, no, no. I was just joking with you. I would not dare ride it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not hurt people randomly,\u201d Han Sen told Ghost Car. The knife stream on Ghost Car retreated. The bird still angrily stared at Wang Yuhang.\n\n\u201cLittle Uncle, this is a xenogeneic,\u201d Han Sen said with a laugh. \u201cIt is not a beast soul mount. You cannot just ride it.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er were holding hands as they came running forward. They looked at Ghost Car with curiosity. The Six-Eared Macaque and Holy Baby were behind them. They arrived like servants.\n\nBao\u2019er pulled Ling\u2019er next to Han Sen. She looked at Ghost Car. \u201cDad? What is this bird, and why is it so ugly?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Ghost Car and said, \u201cI do not know what it is called.\u201d\n\nAlthough its name was Ghost Car, it was a stone element that merged with Han Sen\u2019s Under the Sky Knife power. It was not the true Ghost Car. Calling it Ghost Car, therefore, was not appropriate.\n\n\u201cCall it Little Nine. I am going to pick fruit with Little Sister. Tell Little Nine to take us there.\u201d After speaking, Bao\u2019er pulled Ling\u2019er with her and jumped toward Little Nine.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Little Nine was a true god xenogeneic and could get very angry. If its anger were invoked, it would hurt Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er.\n\nHan Sen wanted to stop them, but the nine-headed bird, which had been named Little Nine by Bao\u2019er, put away its knifelike feathers. It lowered its body and allowed Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er to climb atop its neck and sit.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque and Holy Baby wanted to follow. Before they could get close, Little Nine used its knifelike feathers to threaten them. It also screamed from its nine heads.\n\n\u201cLittle Nine, let\u2019s go,\u201d Bao\u2019er said while patting it on the head. \u201cTake me and Ling\u2019er to collect fruit.\u201d\n\nLittle Nine flew into the sky. It seemed worried about Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er not being comfortable, so Little Nine flew slowly and kept its body balanced.\n\n\u201cHow does that work?\u201d Han Sen was frozen as he watched. He was the one who claimed Little Nine, but Bao\u2019er had been able to commandeer it.\n\n\u201cIt must be Little Nine knowing that Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er are my daughters. They carry my blood. Hence, they listen\u2026 I am the strongest\u2026\u201d Han Sen tried to comfort himself.\n\nAfter thinking of that, Han Sen felt calmer.\n\nAlthough Little Nine had been tamed by him, its identity was still very weird. Han Sen did not trust the thing completely. He would not leave it in Space Garden alone.\n\nHan Sen planned on taking it outside of Space Garden so it could fight for Space Garden. If Bao\u2019er could control it, he did not need to do that.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThe stone tablet was absorbed by Under the Sky Knife power. The Ghost Car xenogeneic\u2019s power has reached top-class true god. I feel safer with it protecting Space Garden. Even if people like Holy Pirate have a special power to sneak into Space Garden, it can protect Space Garden during my absence. No one will be able to do anything to it.\u201d\n\nAlthough it was a good thing to have Little Nine, Han Sen was still annoyed that he had been unable to claim any more deified xenogeneic genes.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of that, the true god materials are deified xenogeneic genes, right? Am I able to eat them?\u201d Han Sen wanted to do that, but he forgot about it. Getting true god items was harder than killing butterfly xenogeneics."
