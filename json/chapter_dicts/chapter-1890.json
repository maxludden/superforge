    "text": "Han Sen thought about it, though, and he decided that the bike was probably quite suitable for someone like Wang Yuhang. If the man could use it to escape things chasing him, then it would be useful enough. Perhaps when the armament evolved some more, it would develop other abilities.\n\nYisha learned nothing from her trip to Planet Crooked Rock. All the factions were now in search of Purgatory Heaven, but no one had turned up any leads yet.\n\nHan Sen was going to take Wang Yuhang to explore the Red Mist Valley, but Yisha gave Han Sen a call and told him they needed to talk about something important.\n\nHan Sen went to meet with her, all the while thinking over any trace of evidence he might have left suggesting what had really gone down on Planet Crooked Rock. He didn\u2019t think he had, though.\n\nWhen they met, she said, \u201cBuddha Ambassador will be visiting Narrow Moon, and there will be a meeting. If you have nothing important that requires your immediate attendance, I suggest you attend,\u201d Yisha said.\n\nHan Sen felt some relief, hearing what she wanted. She didn\u2019t want to talk about Planet Crooked Rock and the missing Icebird Duke. Knowing this, he felt much more at ease.\n\n\u201cQueen, why would the Buddha visit Narrow Moon? What is all this going to be about?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nYisha said, \u201cThe Rebate are quite friendly with the Buddha. We are close allies. The meeting is a formality to sustain our friendship and exchange geno arts. The people who can join the get-together are usually the best of the best.\u201d Yisha paused for a moment, before going on to say, \u201cThe Rebate usually send in members of the Moon Garden. You may not be one of them, but you can still observe the proceedings. The geno arts of the Buddhas are fairly unique, and it might be quite useful for you to learn them. Even if you cannot try them out, you can watch them, at least.\u201d\n\nYes, my queen; I will take a look.\u201d Han Sen did not know what the point of going there actually was, but if Yisha was telling him he should go, he thought there had to be more to it.\n\nBut Yisha didn\u2019t explain any further, so he didn\u2019t ask.\n\nYisha spoke about the Buddha, though. And it jogged Han Sen\u2019s memory about something.\n\nAfter Buddha King was killed by Guya, Han Sen had found two items. One was a Buddha necklace, and the other was a scroll.\n\nThe scroll was scrawled in the text of the Buddha. After its translation, Han Sen learned that it was about a geno art called Unlimited Sutra.\n\nHan Sen checked it out. The main part of the text pertained to evolving, which was practically useless where Han Sen was concerned. He wasn\u2019t interested in a technique that could generate a geno armor.\n\nWhat did interest him, though, were the additions of smaller techniques around the main body of text. It was interesting, and it helped Han Sen understand more about the Buddha.\n\nThe Buddha necklace was a high-class treasure, but Han Sen could not use it. Maybe the user required a certain blood lineage or a special power of some sort.\n\nYisha was allowing Han Sen to participate in the event, and Han Sen thought it might give him a look into Unlimited Sutra. That would only further his knowledge about the Buddha.\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter Han Sen left, Yisha picked up a book and got to reading it. She was in a foul mood. Icebird Duke was still missing, someplace on Planet Crooked Rock. And Yisha had no clue whether she was alive or dead.\n\nThe spots for properly taking part in the event were only available to members of the Moon Garden. But now, the ten Kings of Narrow Moon\u2014aside from two Kings that did not have any students of their own\u2014could allow their students and children to attend.\n\nIt was only Yisha\u2019s student that wasn\u2019t allowed a spot in the proceedings. Hers was relegated to spectating. It made her feel quite poorly.\n\nYisha still allowed Han Sen to go there, though, because she wanted Han Sen to learn more.\n\nThere was something else that made her eager for him to go, too. Han Sen was not a member, so if he was challenged by one of the Buddha students, the challenge couldn\u2019t happen.\n\nHan Sen went back to the base and got back to reading Unlimited Sutra. Then, he gave Wang Yuhang a call. He also called the others and told them all to rendezvous at Red Mist Valley.\n\nThe mist in Red Mist Valley was thick. It could be clearly seen from as far as ten miles away. The mist resembled fiery clouds.\n\nFortunately, it was Planet Eclipse. The magnetic storms and vortexes in the sky were scary. No one could see such things from the sky, and so many of the planet\u2019s secrets had yet to be discovered.\n\n\u201cLittle Uncle, all of this hinges on you,\u201d Han Sen told Wang Yuhang as he pointed down into the valley.\n\nWang Yuhuang was wearing the Marquise armor, and he confidently gave Han Sen a don\u2019t worry gesture. \u201cI will handle this. I\u2019m good at this sort of thing.\u201d\n\nWang Yuhang summoned his bike and rode it towards the valley.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speed straight in. At first, he skirted the entrance before spinning around. He shouted out towards the valley, \u201cEveryone hanging out in this mist, listen! Grampa Wang is here! If you guys don\u2019t come out of here, I\u2019ll destroy you!\u201d\n\nWang Yuhang shouted, and then a sudden chorus of screams erupted from within the mist. And then, many fiery shadows started to emerge, coming straight for him.\n\n\u201cMama mia!\u201d Wang Yuhang put his foot down on the pedal and escaped with his bike. The bike\u2019s speed was very good for a Baron armament, but compared to the fiery shadows, it was actually quite slow. He had only made it a few meters before the shadows had caught up with him.\n\nThere was a pang and Wang Yuhang crashed his bike. He was sent flying a dozen meters before he hit the ground. He rolled quite a bit before coming to a total stop.\n\nLuckily, Wang Yuhang was wearing the Marquise armor. If he hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have been a dead man by now.\n\nBut even though he had the armor, he still felt very dizzy. He picked himself up off the ground, and soon enough, a fiery shadow was before him again. It knocked him away once more.\n\nHan Sen, Gu Qingcheng, and Xie Qing King finally noticed that the fiery shadow was a beast shrouded in red mist. It looked a mink, with three eyes.\n\nThe red mist looked as if it was actually under the red beast\u2019s control. Every time the creature attacked, though, it left marks across Wang Yuhang\u2019s armor.\n\n\u201cQuick! I\u2019m going to die!\u201d Wang Yuhang screamed as the creature happily tossed him around. The beast could not break the Marquise armor, but the force with which it shook him was still enough to have him spewing blood.\n\nHan Sen put on his rabbit shoes. Without hesitation, he leaped towards the little monster and swung his Ghost Teeth Knife, which was swirling with purple light.\n\nThere was no one else around, so he did not have to hide anything. He used his Jadeskin\u2019s godlight\u2014which was Viscount class\u2014with the Ghost Teeth Knife\u2019s knifemind, and struck the beast. It cut through the shadow and left behind a cleft on the creature\u2019s skin."
