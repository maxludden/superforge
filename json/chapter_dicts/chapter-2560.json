Many deified elites noticed its presence, and their faces were all drawn in shock.\n\nAs he watched through a video screen, Ji Yang Sheng noticed the white dot. The white dot was too small, though. It didn\u2019t necessarily mean that Barr was deified yet, so he wasn\u2019t sure what it meant.\n\n\u201cA substance chain\u2026 That is a substance chain! Barr is going to become deified\u2026\u201d Moldo, who was next to him, saw the white dot. His face warped, and he could barely believe his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat? What did you say, Mr. Moldo?\u201d Ji Yang Sheng thought he might have heard that incorrectly. So, he asked Mister Moldo to repeat what he had said.\n\nBefore Moldo could reply, Ji Yang Sheng was answered in an unmistakable way.\n\nThat white dot grew quickly, and the black Destroyed power became white all of a sudden. It was like fire as it wreathed around Barr\u2019s body.\n\nOnly Barr\u2019s black bones remained, but those bones were now becoming white. And that white Destroyed power started to rebuild his flesh.\n\nBoom!\n\nBefore Barr could emerge from that white Destroyed power, the fabric of space seemed to twist and tear. It was like the universe was falling apart. Barr\u2019s body fell into that space and vanished.\n\nWhen Barr disappeared, the scary collapse of space stopped.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? I don\u2019t think Barr had finished changing. Why did he vanish?\u201d Many people were confused by what they saw. They didn\u2019t know why space had seemed to collapse around Barr.\n\n\u201cHe became deified. The core area doesn\u2019t allow deified elites to enter. Once he became deified, he had to be kicked out of the core,\u201d said someone who understood.\n\n\u201cBarr\u2026 became deified\u2026\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was shocked. And then, he felt so annoyed and jealous. If he had paid the two thousand genes that had been requested of him, he was the one who would be deified right now.\n\n\u201cReally? Barr became deified?\u201d Someone in the audience didn\u2019t believe what they had just witnessed.\n\n\u201cHe is deified? This has to be a hoax. Come on, are you telling me Han Sen made another deified?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anyone mind explaining to me how this could happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is God\u2019s Daddy. That\u2019s why, and this is further evidence. He really can do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo thousand King xenogeneic genes? You only need two thousand King xenogeneic genes to be made deified? This world has gone mad. Or am I the one that has been driven insane? Since when did deifieds become so cheap?\u201d\n\nAt that moment, the whole universe seemed to go crazy. Everyone that looked at Han Sen no longer saw a person. They saw a god statue that people could make wishes before. They all wanted to go before him and bow, hoping to have their foreheads touched and be made deified.\n\n\u201cBarr really became deified?\u201d The Sixth Uncle stared at his screen with a gaping mouth. He struggled to close it. Up until Han Sen departed the core area, he looked strange.\n\n\u201cIt will be easy enough for us to find out if Barr really did become deified. All we have to do is send someone over to the Destroyed and learn the truth right from the horse\u2019s mouth,\u201d Meng Lie said.\n\nEvery race leader was doing the same thing as the Extreme King. They wanted to learn about Barr\u2019s condition. Barr didn\u2019t remain hidden for long, though. He stood before everyone, not hiding the power he received by becoming deified.\n\n\u201cHe really did become deified.\u201d There was no doubt about it now. Every person of the higher races looked at Han Sen as if he was mad. Everyone was waving their xenogeneic genes, hoping they could draw Han Sen out to bless them.\n\nTwo thousand xenogeneic genes was a high number, but compared to being a deified, it was nothing. It was peanuts. Exchanging two thousand King xenogeneic genes to become a deified was more than worth it.\n\nIf Han Sen was willing to give more blessings, every high race would pay for blessings until they bankrupted themselves.\n\nArthur had watched Barr become deified. He was so happy about the result. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes had been handed out in return for a deified Barr. This was so f*cking worth it.\n\nEven Dia Robber was surprised. He thought Han Sen\u2019s blessing would only reinforce Barr\u2019s genes. He hadn\u2019t expected Barr to become a deified straight away.\n\n\u201cThis man is too scary.\u201d Dia Robber wasn\u2019t that surprised about Barr becoming deified, though. He was worried more than anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Dia Robber feeling this way, either. Many elites of the higher race were scared of Han Sen. This was a fear that they had never experienced before.\n\nA King class being was manufacturing deified beings. It was almost too shocking to believe. He was able to take the whole universe and flip it on its head.\n\nOrdinary Kings and nobles didn\u2019t think much of it, though. They just thought what Han Sen had done was something of a miracle.\n\n\u201cMr. Godfather is too strong, but I don\u2019t have two thousand King class genes. Maybe if I did, I would ask him to bless me so I could become deified.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo thousand xenogeneic genes are far beyond what I have. Would he take women, instead? I would pay with my body if I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop dreaming. Look in the mirror. Are you as pretty as those two women the Godfather has?\u201d\n\n\u201cF*ck! He has all the good stuff, and he has sick power. He even has insanely pretty women. He has it all.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was randomly bestowed this Godfather title. Before, many people referred to Han Sen as God\u2019s Daddy. But that title was a secret one, and not something they would refer to him as in public.\n\nAfter this event, though, the Godfather title became quite common. It made him sound like a clergyman, but it didn\u2019t mean that.\n\nJi Yang Sheng was the most depressed of all now, though. He had pulled the rickshaw for Han Sen for a very long time. He even gave him five hundred King class xenogeneic genes. He received nothing in return. Instead, Barr was made deified.\n\nIf God gave Ji Yang Sheng the chance to do things over, he would tell Han Sen, \u201cYes, I will give them to you.\u201d\n\nIf he had known that Han Sen could really make people deified, he would have been willing to pay more than two thousand King xenogeneic genes. He would have been willing to pay double that sum.\n\nThe only issue was that no one had believed Han Sen could make others deified before this. After all, it did sound a little ridiculous.\n\nWhen Han Sen entered the core area, the Kings of every race came out and shocked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTeacher Han, I brought you two thousand King xenogeneic genes. If you are willing to bless me, I will give them to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet lost! What is this about two thousand King xenogeneic genes? You are being that cheap before the Godfather? I have 2500 King class xenogeneic genes. I should be blessed first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have 3000\u2026\u201d\n\nEven Ji Yang Sheng had brought two thousand King class xenogeneic genes to Han Sen, but when he saw how busy things were, he didn\u2019t fancy his chances. He felt so sad."
