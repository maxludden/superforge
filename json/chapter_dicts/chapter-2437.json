    "text": "\u201cMy Lady is a princess of the Extreme King, and you are the king\u2019s sister. You are the leader of Spring Rain. Are you really going to believe in the truthfulness of this \u2018prophecy\u2019? Tell me the real reason you want to kill her,\u201d Han Sen said coolly as he eyed Miss Mirror.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t continue trying to attack him. She looked at Han Sen for a while before saying, \u201cProphecies can have very real power. Not many elites can actually predict the future, but there are some. Most notably, the Very High are very skilled at prophecy. They are able to predict events in a similar manner to how the pictures on that screen seem to function.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that isn\u2019t the real reason that you want to kill her,\u201d Han Sen said, shaking his head.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t deny the accusation. \u201cRight now, her body is weak, so weak that any noble could kill her. But the powers that she displayed earlier were very strong. Even Night Wind, a deified elite of the Extreme King, was brought down in a single blow. This strangely fluctuating power reminds me of someone from an old legend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Han Sen raised his eyebrow.\n\n\u201cSacred Leader,\u201d Miss Mirror said slowly.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? Sacred Leader led so many powerful elites. If he had a weakness that was so obvious, I\u2019m sure he would have died many times over,\u201d Han Sen replied skeptically.\n\nIf Sacred Leader\u2019s body was that weak, he would have had great difficulty keeping himself alive, let alone ruling an empire. He commanded a multitude of people with incredible power; such people would have discovered his weakness quite easily. There was no way Sacred Leader could have led Sacred for so long with such a blatant flaw.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is only a legend. Although Sacred Leader\u2019s body was sometimes weak, he was always wearing a magical set of armor. Even those closest to Sacred Leader never saw his face. Plus, he was extremely skilled with the powers of time and space. Ambushing or trapping him would have been impossible. I don\u2019t know exactly what it means, but this girl\u2019s power is very abnormal. Maybe she is somehow connected with Sacred Leader. Even if they aren\u2019t related, I must still take the precaution of killing her. I am not risking my life for her.\u201d Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen and went on to say, \u201cYou should leave now, as this is your last chance. If you try to stop me, I will kill you. I won\u2019t let you escape if you oppose me here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had questions he needed to ask the girl, many of which he desperately wanted to know the answers to. He didn\u2019t want her to die just yet.\n\n\u201cI am sorry, but I\u2019d like for her to live,\u201d Han Sen murmured quietly.\n\nMiss Mirror said nothing. She merely slashed towards Han Sen, letting her actions speak for her. She had made a decision. And if Han Sen was going to stop her from killing the girl, she would no longer try to avoid injuring him.\n\nBased on the power in Miss Mirror\u2019s attack, it seemed that she was no longer playing around. And Han Sen knew it. He took this threat seriously. His Purple-Eye Butterfly kept spinning, analyzing Miss Mirror\u2019s sword skill.\n\nHe could use his Dongxuan Area to stop Miss Mirror\u2019s area and power, but that skill was part of his identity as Dollar. If Han Sen used it in this situation, then his identity would be exposed. He didn\u2019t want to have to do that unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s sword skills were strangely unpredictable. They were not Causal sword skills, but they were still hard to dodge. As he saw Miss Mirror coming, Han Sen moved again to avoid her blade.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s movement was fast. He was faster than Miss Mirror, but somehow, the broken sword still hit him and sliced into his arm.\n\nHan Sen had the undying Original Water King Body, so even if his body was cut open, he could heal immediately. Normal injuries wouldn\u2019t really hurt him. When he took a strike from that broken sword, however, his Original Water King Body wasn\u2019t healing.\n\n\u201cIt looks like this broken sword might have been quite the infamous weapon. Even the Original Water King Body cannot stand against it. You better think about how much you really want to stop me. The next hit won\u2019t land on your arm,\u201d Miss Mirror promised, and then, she swung her sword. The sword arced like a rainbow, seeming to disappear mid-swing, like usual.\n\n\u201cI understand your sword skills.\u201d Han Sen moved, and Miss Mirror\u2019s attack hit nothing.\n\nMiss Mirror froze. She swung her sword at Han Sen again. Many sword rainbows came down, but Han Sen was like a butterfly. He fluttered back and forth, weaving between the sword rainbows. He was still holding the girl, though, and so he couldn\u2019t fight back. But he dodged each and every one of Miss Mirror\u2019s attacks.\n\n\u201cThis must be a combination of your Mirror Area and your sword skills. Sword skills that go across the Mirror World can\u2019t really be dodged. It flips the world, allowing an attack to travel through space that shouldn\u2019t exist. That keeps your opponents from discerning where a sword is coming from because they can\u2019t follow the blade along its path. It is a very powerful move, but it is useless against someone like me,\u201d Han Sen said, continuing to speak calmly as he dodged Miss Mirror\u2019s attacks.\n\nMiss Mirror finally forced herself to accept that Han Sen could see through her Mirror sword skills. Continuing to attack would be pointless, so she lowered the sword.\n\n\u201cCan we actually talk now?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want to fight with Miss Mirror. Doing that would lead them right into the prophesied scenario.\n\nMiss Mirror gently laughed. \u201cYou think you have escaped my Mirror sword skills?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I not?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIf you insist on getting in my way, I will let you see the real Mirror Area,\u201d Miss Mirror said, before lifting the sword in her hand again.\n\nHan Sen knew Miss Mirror was an annoyingly powerful woman, so he hadn\u2019t let his guard down when she stopped attacking.\n\n\u201cI will use this sword to blind your left eye.\u201d Miss Mirror swung with the broken sword, but this time, no sword rainbows appeared, twisting sinuously through space itself. This power, power slammed into Han Sen with no warning.\n\nPain shot through Han Sen\u2019s left eye like it had been stabbed by a needle. Blood squirted from it, then the eyeball exploded. Han Sen didn\u2019t even see how she had managed to get his eye.\n\n\u201cThis attack will break your right eye,\u201d Miss Mirror said simply, then she slashed again with her broken sword.\n\nHan Sen focused, pushing his Purple-Eye Butterfly to the max. He still couldn\u2019t identify the power that was pushing the broken sword.\n\nA ripping sensation came from his right eye, as if it had been cut by a blade as well. It exploded like the left eye, and blood poured from the socket.\n\nBecause of the broken sword\u2019s weird power, his eyes kept bleeding. The bleeding wasn\u2019t going to stop, and his blood wouldn\u2019t crystallize, either.\n\n\u201cLet go of that girl, or my next strike will kill you,\u201d Miss Mirror said in a hard tone.\n\nHan Sen was now blind, but that didn\u2019t affect what he could feel. He still looked incredibly calm as he said, \u201cI should have known this was the real Mirror Area. My eyes reflected you and your sword, so you could break my eyes using your mirror. Now that my eyes are destroyed, what else will reflect you and your sword? How are you going to kill me?\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror sighed. \u201cYou are too young. You think that\u2019s all my Mirror Area can do?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Miss Mirror raised her hand, and an old mirror appeared next to her. It was as tall as she was. That old mirror was pointed at Han Sen, and it reflected Han Sen\u2019s image.\n\nMiss Mirror thrust her blade toward the mirror. The broken sword shoved through the mirror, but the mirror wasn\u2019t broken. Han Sen felt a surge of pain in his chest, and a bloody hole appeared not far from his sternum.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful Mirror Area! Thank you for not killing me, my Lady.\u201d Han Sen knew this sword Miss Mirror wielded could have penetrated his heart or sliced his head off."
