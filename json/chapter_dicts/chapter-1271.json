When Han Sen emerged from the bushes, he did so drenched in water.\n\n\u201cFriend, what are you talking about? What fruit?\u201d Han Sen played dumb.\n\n\u201cHuman?\u201d The man\u2019s intimidating look turned to one of legitimate surprise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re of the same kind, are we not? My name is Han Sen. What is your name, friend?\u201d Han Sen thought this was the perfect opportunity to gather the information he wanted.\n\nThe man answered, \u201cI\u2019m not your friend, buddy. And I have never been a friend of humans, so don\u2019t have the audacity to declare us one and the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not a human,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThe man said, \u201cDon\u2019t mistake me for one of you mud-blooded low-lives. Pah, you talk too much. I was going to let you live, but now\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter that, the man immediately threw a punch in Han Sen\u2019s direction.\n\nHan Sen did not expect his eagerness to fight, and he didn\u2019t think the man would have a disdain for humans and believe himself to be so different.\n\nBut Han Sen was certain the man was a human.\n\nAs much as he would have loved to mull the situation some more, he didn\u2019t have the time to think. The fist was in front of his face, and he had little time to react.\n\nHan Sen opened the nine gene locks of his Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt like he had tried to deflect an oncoming train, and the force sent him staggering backwards a number of steps. Han Sen came to a stop after planting his feet and creating a pair of hundred-meter-long skidmarks in defiance of the force.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s bones had cracked, and his arms had been utterly broken.\n\n\u201cSo strong!\u201d Han Sen was in shock, particularly so given that the man\u2019s punch was one derived of pure, raw strength. There was no element associated with the hit.\n\n\u201cThe Blood-Pulse Sutra? Are you from Blood Legion?\u201d The man was visibly surprised.\n\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Han Sen asked. Earlier, the man had said he was a member of the Blueblood Special Forces. Now, was he suggesting he was a member of Blood Legion?\n\nThe man smiled and said, \u201cI was afraid there weren\u2019t any more true descendants in this day and age, but if you practice the Blood-Pulse Sutra, you must be a genuine disciple of Blood Legion. You must have heard the tale of the thirteen members, then? I was one of them; I was God\u2019s Retribution.\u201d\n\nThe man went on to say, \u201cWho is your master? And why is your Blood-Pulse Sutra so weak?\u201d\n\nHan Sen took a chance and said, \u201cI am a student of Qin Huaizhen. He taught me this before he died, so I do not know too much about the legion.\u201d\n\n\u201cQin Huaizhen?\u201d The man paused, as if in thought. Then he said, \u201cIs Blood Legion doing that poorly? Are they teaching\u2026 outsiders now?\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not respond. If he spoke, he knew he\u2019d have to choose his words carefully. He did not want to incite the ire of this man any further, as a mistake in what he said could result in his death.\n\nThe man said, \u201cIt is difficult to find someone who can learn this, and you must be the first of your lineage to carry this skill. You should use a title, but you are far too weak right now and thus cannot. Down the line, a few generations ahead of you, when your descendants become Blueblood, they can bear a title.\u201d\n\nHan Sen suddenly understood a lot more.\n\nBlood-Pulse Sutra was used to strengthen your genes for those further down in your lineage. Each generation would be stronger than the last. The Xuan Men successor said the Blood-Pulse Sutra was a frightful thing, and that their fitness was far above everyone else\u2019s.\n\nAnd now, this man had just told him that each new generation in a lineage would be stronger than the last. And what\u2019s more, their blood would become blue. In turn, that meant every true member of Blood Legion should have blue blood.\n\nTime was what strengthened the Blood-Pulse Sutra above all else. Vigorous practice of its teachings did not allow for much in the grander scheme of things.\n\nThe best thing about the Blood-Pulse Sutra was the evolution of genes from generation to generation. Many generations down the line, family members would become incredibly strong.\n\nIts ineffectiveness for the first generation was why Han Sen, despite his vigorous study of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, had yet to become much stronger than a super creature.\n\nPeople like God\u2019s Retribution were the elite of the elite when it came to Blood Legion.\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \u201cIf the thirteen members were the ones who were born from families whose lineage reached back into ancient times, Han Jinzhi must have been one.\u201d\n\nBut Baby Ghost told Han Sen he had been kidnapped. If this new learning was true, why would he have been kidnapped? And the Qin family\u2019s blood was red and not blue, too.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mind was drowning in a vat of questions.\n\nBut if Han Jinzhi was not one of the thirteen members, he could not have been Han Sen\u2019s great-grandfather.\n\nNo one in the Han family had practiced the Blood-Pulse Sutra, that was true, but it\u2019d take a few generations for the strength and potency of a Blood Legion lineage to lessen. Han Sen should have still had some amount of blue blood.\n\nHis father should have most certainly had some, for sure. Han Sen knew his family had nothing to do with the blue-blooded, and he knew he couldn\u2019t have been a part of Blood Legion.\n\nIf the Han family had nothing to do with Han Jinzhi, though, why would he possess the nine-life cat item?\n\nThe man suddenly said, \u201cThe two Aqua Fruit you possess can be kept. Consider them a gift, from one member to another.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the man turned to leave."
