    "text": "Through the opening was a square hole which held a wooden box around the size of a football. Han Sen pulled the box out, and the statue returned to how it had been when he first saw it.\n\nHan Sen returned to sit in front of the statue. It didn\u2019t have the sense of life that it had possessed before. It seemed that the statue really had become what it was supposed to be: a statue. There were no further hidden meanings to its existence, and the gourd in the statue\u2019s hand didn\u2019t summon that feeling of familiarity that it once had.\n\n\u201cThe statue really can only be activated once.\u201d Han Sen was looking at the wooden box. He thought to himself, \u201cThis is what the alpha of the Extreme King left behind. It cannot be anything lame, surely. It must be a deified weapon or something of the sort.\u201d\n\nThe box wasn\u2019t locked, and when Han Sen opened it up, he was given a shock.\n\nThe wooden box held a jade gourd about the size of Han Sen\u2019s hand. It looked like a green crystal. The crystal seemed transparent, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t see what was inside it.\n\n\u201cThis jade gourd must have been carved. It isn\u2019t a creature. Perhaps it\u2019s a bottle shaped like a gourd?\u201d Han Sen took the jade gourd out the box, but the gourd was entirely whole. There was no hole or seam that he could find.\n\nJudging from the weight and feel, it didn\u2019t seem hollow, though. It was made of solid jade.\n\nHan Sen looked at the green gourd, and when he looked at its bottom, his fingers trembled. The bottom was flat, and a few words were carved on it.\n\n\u201cFor the leader of Sacred only.\u201d Han Sen was given a proper shock after reading those words.\n\nAs far as Han Sen knew, there was only one \u201cleader of Sacred.\u201d And this thing was from the Extreme King alpha. This couldn\u2019t have been some nameless, meaningless item.\n\n\u201cIs the alpha of the Extreme King connected to the leader of Sacred? Otherwise, why would the Extreme King alpha have an item that belonged to the Sacred leader? Perhaps the Extreme King alpha received it sometime after the Sacred leader died. I still think they are related, though,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen turned the jade gourd over in his hands to study it. He couldn\u2019t tell what it did.\n\n\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll just take it with me for now.\u201d Han Sen put the jade gourd in his chest pocket. Then he picked up the wooden box and exited the Pavilion.\n\nHe knew many people would be watching the Pavilion, but he had no choice but to leave. He couldn\u2019t stay there forever. He had to make an exit eventually.\n\nEven though he had gone through a lot of things, in the face of something like this, even Han Sen was quite nervous. He couldn\u2019t be certain of avoiding exposure now, with all the eyes watching him and his disguise of Bai Yi.\n\n\u201cBai Yi! He is the one who\u2026?\u201d When Han Sen walked out of the Pavilion, all the Extreme King elites were surprised.\n\nMany high level people knew that Bai Yi had used Return to Origin on Han Sen. The only people that didn\u2019t know Bai Yi now looked like Han Sen were the few who didn\u2019t read the news.\n\nEven if they knew he was Bai Yi, though, they were still stunned. Even King Bai and Ancient Abyss were frightfully shocked. They hadn\u2019t expected Bai Yi to have been the one to understand the statue.\n\n\u201cThat is a rare occurrence, indeed,\u201d King Bai said, as he watched. That was all he said, and no one knew exactly what he meant by the cryptic remark.\n\nAncient Abyss looked at Han Sen. Then, he turned back to King Bai. \u201cHow lucky. Congratulations, your majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuck has nothing to do with it,\u201d King Bai said in a cool voice.\n\nThe other elites were even more shocked than King Bai. When Bai Wei looked at Han Sen, she felt a complex flurry of emotions.\n\nBai Ling Shuang\u2019s face kept changing and twitching. When Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, she frowned in thought.\n\nAmong the Extreme King, that day would be remembered for its stunning revelation. Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, had claimed the alpha\u2019s statue. It was like a miracle.\n\nThe alpha\u2019s statue had been there for billions of years, and no one had been able to understand what was inside it. And Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, who already had a bad reputation, had been the one to claim it. Everyone had their socks blown off.\n\nWhen Han Sen rode the blood kirin back to Planet Water Zone, even the Princess Lan Haixin couldn\u2019t help but stare at him from atop the palace.\n\nLan Haixin didn\u2019t understand how Bai Yi had been able to claim the alpha king\u2019s statue. She found it a very hard thing to believe.\n\nHan Sen returned to his little building, closed the door, then started to play with his jade gourd. Aside from the words mentioning it was for the Sacred leader only, there was nothing else special about it. He couldn\u2019t feel any special power residing inside it, despite searching it as thoroughly as he could.\n\nHan Sen had a look at it with his Purple-Eye Butterfly, and there was nothing to witness. But, that did prove that the jade gourd was unusual.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame Bao\u2019er has gone undercover with Lan Haixin. It would be great if she was here. The statue\u2019s gourd is so similar to Bao\u2019er. Perhaps the jade gourd really is related to her,\u201d Han Sen mused.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d As Han Sen was lost in thought, Bao\u2019er came jumping toward him, holding a variety of packages in her small arms.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, why are you back?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Bao\u2019er was holding lots of food, and none of the goodies looked cheap. Her clothes were very pretty, too, and they obviously followed the fashion trends of the Siren.\n\n\u201cI missed you, Dad!\u201d Bao\u2019er leaped into Han Sen\u2019s chest and rubbed her face against Han Sen\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDad missed Bao\u2019er, too. But Bao\u2019er, did Lan Haixin\u2019s people see you coming?\u201d Han Sen was hoping Bao\u2019er had been able to get some information while he was away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one saw me.\u201d Bao\u2019er gave the food to Han Sen. \u201cYou must have been eating bad food while you were alone. Allow me to give you the good stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood good! You are so nice. You are the best daughter that a daddy could ask for.\u201d Han Sen merrily accepted the food and started eating. Filled with curiosity, he handed Bao\u2019er the jade gourd. \u201cBao\u2019er, do you recognize what this is?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er accepted the jade gourd and shook it. Then, she turned it upside-down. Something like water poured out of the jade gourd.\n\nHan Sen was given another shock. He had thought the jade gourd was solid. He hadn\u2019t realized that there was something hidden away inside.\n\nThe liquid that came out of the gourd looked like water, but it wasn\u2019t. When the liquid came out, it didn\u2019t flow out onto the floor. It floated in the air, and it looked like a floating fairy. Rather than dividing into droplets, the fairy held together in a single floating pool. It looked similar to Han Sen using the Original Water King Body.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Han Sen was given another shock.\n\n\u201cHelp Daddy to shower,\u201d Bao\u2019er directed the water fairy as she held the gourd.\n\nThe water fairy came over to Han Sen and stripped all his clothes off. Then she twirled her finger, and a water air wrapped around Han Sen\u2019s entire body. It made him feel as if he was in the embrace of a natural spring."
