In less than a minute, his lifespan had increased by half a millennium.\n\n\u201cI wonder how many years he has taken from the Extreme King? This cannot be all, surely.\u201d Han Sen asked the black crystal armor, directing a greedy stare at where the man\u2019s body had been.\n\nThe black crystal armor ignored him. It turned around and returned to his Sea of Soul. Just like before, it hung in a corner of the Sea of Soul without moving an inch.\n\n***\n\nThe moment the guy that called himself God was destroyed, far away, in a mysterious palace, a man frowned and said, \u201cEmpty God\u2026 Even if my god doll offended you, you could have just taken his eyes. Instead, you actually killed him. Do you think I am afraid of you?\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn the streets, the fortune-teller looked at the broken article of underwear in his hand, then let it go. It was reduced to dust. He sighed and said, \u201cWhat a shame. It was hard to get my hands on that item.\u201d\n\nHe picked up his bowl of noodles that had fallen to the ground and wiped the bowl clean with a cloth. Then, he put the bowl away. Picking up his sign, which read \u201cDestiny,\u201d he walked down the street and disappeared amidst the crowds.\n\n***\n\nHan Sen watched the man turn to dust, and as he did, he realized that his time was up. He quickly ran down through the tower. As he ran, he thought to himself, \u201cIf the Extreme King finds out the statue is destroyed, they won\u2019t come after me, will they? I won\u2019t admit I was the one to destroy it, but even if I said I did, they wouldn\u2019t believe I was able to, would they?\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen reached the sixth floor, he saw that the paintings were still hanging on the walls. But the meaning and influence behind them had disappeared. They were just ordinary paintings now.\n\nIt was like this all the way down. All of the paintings had lost their god minds. They were nothing special anymore.\n\n\u201cWeird. Fox Queen said the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror was inside this tower. How come I haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d With that thought, Han Sen checked the time and realized that he still had one hour left. So, he decided to look around the tower.\n\nHe had walked up and down the tower many times over the past month. Aside from the paintings, the man had been the only other thing there. There were no mirrors.\n\n\u201cWas Fox Queen lying to me? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Lying to me about the mirror wouldn\u2019t benefit her in any way.\u201d Han Sen frowned and thought to himself, \u201cDid someone manage to trick Fox Queen herself? Maybe give her bogus intel? If that is the case, then that might mean Fox Queen\u2019s identity has been exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Fox Queen is smart. Tricking someone like her would be difficult.\u201d Han Sen was both intrigued and a little worried, so he looked into every corner of Destiny\u2019s Tower with complete thoroughness.\n\nThere was no Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. There was nothing inside the tower at all. Han Sen could see each floor clearly with just a look. If there was a mirror, he would have seen it. Searching should have been unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anywhere to hide things in this tower. Aside from the statue man that looked like a human but wasn\u2019t actually a human, that is.\u201d Han Sen suddenly thought of the man who had been sitting atop that pedestal. He returned to the seventh floor.\n\nIf something was hidden anywhere in this tower, it had to be inside that pedestal.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t returned to the seventh floor in order to help Fox Queen, though. If there really was a treasure like the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror, he would take it for himself. After all, the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror would be a powerful item. The Foxes thought that regaining the item would let them take back a prominent place in the universe.\n\nBack on the seventh floor, Han Sen looked at the platform the man had been sitting upon. It was just an ordinary stone pedestal. There was nothing special about it. It was made of the same stone that composed the rest of Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nHan Sen reached out his hands and pressed against the pedestal. The platform had taken no damage at all. It clearly wasn\u2019t something that would break easily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that I used all my Nine Spin Fox Power. Otherwise, I could try to use that power to summon the mirror.\u201d Han Sen went silent for a moment, then extended one of his fingers over the stone. He allowed a droplet of blood to fall down onto the pedestal.\n\nThat blood was infused with the power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra. Han Sen wanted to see if the platform was spiritual in some capacity.\n\nWhen the blood splashed onto the stone, the platform began to shake. The blood then blended into the pedestal, and it shook even harder.\n\nSuddenly, the platform floated up into the air. It hovered, its stone enamel cracking and flaking off from the violent tremoring. Soon, the real face of the pedestal began to be revealed.\n\nA while later, the stone surface shattered completely, revealing the stone mirror inside. When Han Sen let another droplet of blood bleed onto the stone mirror, silver light glowed from the mirror. Within the reflective surface, Han Sen saw the shadow of a silver nine-tailed fox. Those nine tails swayed softly, as the small fox eyes regarded Han Sen.\n\nBuzz!\n\nThe stone mirror started to fly, spinning around Han Sen. The stone mirror was the size of a mortar and pestle, but it shrank until it was around the size of Han Sen\u2019s hand. It landed in his palm, and then the light completely disappeared. The shadow of the nine-tailed fox in the mirror was gone.\n\nHan Sen lifted the mirror, and he realized that it no longer reflected anything. It was just a piece of grayish-white stone. Even if he tried to polish it with a soft fabric, the mirror refused to show a reflection.\n\nBut on the back of the stone mirror, Han Sen found an engraving of the nine-tailed fox. It was just like the shadow Han Sen had seen when the mirror was glowing.\n\nThe droplet of blood had vanished. It seemed to have disappeared when the stone mirror activated. Han Sen played with the stone mirror for a while, but he was unable to find out how to use it. He couldn\u2019t activate the stone mirror\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cI can try to use my blood to gain control of it. Maybe it will come to recognize me like the jade drum did.\u201d Han Sen put away the stone mirror and waited until the departure time was upon him. When that time rolled around, Destiny\u2019s Tower opened. Quickly, he rushed out of there.\n\nThe Extreme King didn\u2019t seem to know anything about what had transpired inside Destiny\u2019s Tower, which made him feel very relieved. He said his goodbyes and returned to Planet Water Zone\u2019s Underwater Town.\n\n\u201cIf you were that powerful, you should have just done it sooner. If something like that happens again, you don\u2019t need to wait around before cutting the bad guy down. Kill a few more Gods, and we\u2019ll live a lot longer,\u201d Han Sen said to the black crystal armor in his Sea of Soul once he had returned to his room.\n\nBut the black crystal armor didn\u2019t move. It behaved as it always did, like a dead object.\n\nWhen the black crystal armor didn\u2019t react, Han Sen left it alone. He rested at home for a few more days, waiting to see if the Extreme King noticed any changes in Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nLuckily, the Extreme King was none the wise. They didn\u2019t seem to have a clue that the man statue inside Destiny\u2019s Tower had been destroyed. It made Han Sen feel much safer.\n\nHan Sen: super god spirit body\n\nGeno Battle Body: Mutant Blood (Duke), Spell (Duke), Dongxuan (King), Jadeskin (Duke)\n\nLevel: King\n\nKing Genes: 22\n\nDeified Progress: 12%\n\nLifespan: 1787\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t dead?\u201d Upon learning that Han Sen was alive and had visited Destiny\u2019s Tower, Fox Queen was amazed."
