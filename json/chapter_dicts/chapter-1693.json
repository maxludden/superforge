    "text": "Han Sen put the item in his hand. It was around ten centimeters long, and it looked like a bone. But it didn\u2019t feel like a bone; it actually felt heavier than metal.\n\nIt was obscured in a lot of blood, so it was hard to discern its original appearance. He wiped it all away to reveal its true form.\n\nIt was part of a small bone, but it was red and a little purplish. It was different from the Feather\u2019s other bones.\n\nHan Sen kept looking around the dead body. Aside from that little bone, the rest were white and of the correct weight. They were a little heavier than a human\u2019s, but not like the way the purple one was. That was way heavier.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen asked Old Cat, holding out the bone.\n\nThe cat looked bored, like he could not even muster the energy to answer. \u201cA bone? What else could it be?\u201d\n\nOld Cat didn\u2019t answer him straight, so Han Sen didn\u2019t bother asking him again. If the cat wasn\u2019t going to tell him anything, it was pointless trying to get answers from him.\n\nHan Sen investigated the bone himself, but he found nothing truly special about it. Or at least, he couldn\u2019t at the moment.\n\nSo, he put the bone away and turned to ask the Old Cat, \u201cOld Cat, do you know how I can get back to the Alliance?\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not want to be there for long. God\u2019s Organization might have found his home, he would need to return as soon as he could. There was no time to waste.\n\n\u201cFind a teleporter in a shelter. You can get back that way,\u201d Old Cat said casually.\n\n\u201cIf I teleport, where will I end up?\u201d Han Sen asked. The teleporter of a shelter would send a person back to the point they entered from. But the Nine-Life Cat tattoo had pulled him in from nowhere specific. He hadn\u2019t used a teleporter, and thus, he didn\u2019t know what would happen to him if he used one now.\n\nOld Cat sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. You might end up somewhere random.\u201d\n\nHearing Old Cat say this, Han Sen\u2019s face fell. Teleporting randomly was bad. If he ended up somewhere far from Planet Roca, he couldn\u2019t make it home in any short jiffy.\n\nHan Sen asked how he could leave the ruins he was currently in and if there were any shelters nearby the cat was aware of. Then, he left.\n\nOld Cat didn\u2019t want to leave yet, though. He still wanted to unearth more items.\n\nBut Han Sen had to go and so he left the ruins via the directions given to him by Old Cat. He proceeded to the nearest shelter.\n\nHan Sen had been in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary for a long time, but he was in an area he had never ventured to before. He had only heard Old Cat tell him that there was a shelter around. Old Cat had never been there, though, and it had been taken over by creatures. To Han Sen, that sounded like a super shelter.\n\nHan Sen used his Death Armor Swordsman on his way there.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fitness was ten thousand. Using the super shapeshifting beast soul would burden his body. Before, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have been able to use it for very long. But his body had changed after the ascension, and shapeshift beast souls did not tax him like they used to.\n\n***\n\nBlack Sky Demon Shelter was around that mountain someplace. Xie Qing King frowned and leaned forward. He saw a humanoid creature with black horns. \u201cBlack God, why are you blocking my way?\u201d\n\n\u201cXie Qing, I\u2019ve heard you have been cocky.\u201d Black God looked at Xie Qing King and spoke.\n\n\u201cThat is none of your business,\u201d Xie Qing King said coldly.\n\nBlack God laughed and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t any of my business, but you have been cocky around my Black Sky Demon Shelter. I will give you a decision to make. The first is that you die. The second\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore he finished speaking, Xie Qing King\u2019s body flashed with a silver light. He threw a punch towards the foe.\n\nBlack God was so mad, and the demonic aura he had blasted towards and against Xie Qing King\u2019s fist.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe silver light and the demonic force collided, creating an explosion. Xie Qing King did not move, but Black God was knocked back ten meters.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder you have such a reputation. You are cocky,\u201d Black God said darkly. Then he went on to say, \u201cSince I am here, you can still choose to obey me. The choice is yours.\u201d\n\nWith Black God\u2019s booming voice, the entire mountain was shrouded with a menacing presence. It became tangible, as many forces started to surround Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, there is only one word. And that is: fight.\u201d Xie Qing King\u2019s eyes were on fire, and the silver light erupted like a volcano.\n\nHis entire body became silver as he ran towards Black God.\n\nBlack God grunted. The demonic aura summoned a black geno core sword into his hands. He immediately slashed towards Xie Qing King with both hands.\n\nThe demonic force came out like a rippling flash in the air. It looked as if it was going to sunder the skies.\n\nXie Qing King clenched his fists and went against the demonic force. Then, a silver glove appeared upon his fist\n\nThey collided in mid-air. The silver light, however, was indestructible. The demonic force was easily broken, and the silver glove came down on the sword.\n\nA katcha noise sounded as the sword snapped easily. Black God was sent flying into a nearby mountain, breaking it.\n\n\u201cKill him!\u201d Black God staggered back from the mountainside, shouting. His face was drenched with blood.\n\nSix scary presences surrounded Xie Qing King. They were all as strong as Black God, and they all started to attack at once.\n\nThe silver light was so bright on Xie Qing King\u2019s fist, and the super creatures did not dare face it directly. The color of the sky changed, and it looked like the end of the world.\n\nBlack God looked ill. He had brought six super creatures to attack Xie Qing King, and while they managed to hurt him, he had managed to hurt them back. The seven of them were injured, with one being severely wounded.\n\nPang!\n\nXie Qing King hit Black God and crushed his armor. Black God\u2019s chest caved in.\n\nJust as he was about to finish him off, a scary power appeared. Xie Qing King heard a cold voice.\n\n\u201cHurt one of my blood and you are dead!\u201d"
