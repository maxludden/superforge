    "text": "As Exquisite stood in the arena, she looked more like a piece of machinery than a living being. Her expression was utterly placid, as if she could see through everything. Even sages and prophets wouldn\u2019t be so calm and controlled.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times I see this, I\u2019m always struck by both the power and the cruelty of the Very High Eye. They have managed to combine the sky with their body. They should be the real Sky people. But combining with the Sky makes them a part of the universal ruleset. Does the real Exquisite still exist?\u201d Sky Palace Leader looked at Exquisite and sighed.\n\n\u201cOur alpha worried about that, too. That was why he insisted on interbreeding with another race to create an entirely new people It brought about very special changes for the Very High Eye. Our Very High Eyes might have weakened now that they are no longer perfectly aligned with the universal ruleset, but the changes did open the door for other, grander opportunities. It has more possibilities than the Very High Eye.\u201d The woman paused and went on to say, \u201cBut anyway, we are part of the universe. There is no way for us to disconnect from it, no matter what we do. From that perspective, the path of the Very High is the correct one. They are the race that is closest to the weave that composes the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight or wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter. We should just take the path we feel is right. Results are something only time can tell us,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said with a shrug.\n\nHan Sen was admiring Exquisite\u2019s power. He watched her use this ability once before, but seeing it again was just as moving.\n\nPeople weren\u2019t perfect; everyone had their flaws. When Exquisite opened her Very High Eye, however, she no longer seemed like a mortal being with failings and frailties. It was as if she wasn\u2019t even a person. She was like some art piece created by none other than God himself.\n\n\u201cUse all your strength, or else you won\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d Exquisite told Han Sen. Her words might have sounded cocky, but there was no cockiness in her tone. It was more like she was just speaking facts.\n\nHan Sen smiled. He lifted his hand like a knife and used Fang to slash toward her.\n\nThe last time they fought, they had been using the water of a nearby pond. It was like a practice session for him, and Exquisite hadn\u2019t used all her Very High power.\n\nThis time, it was different. She wasn\u2019t holding back. Exquisite\u2019s battling power was firing on all cylinders.\n\nPurple knife air flew out of his palm like the fangs of a toxic snake that was leaping forward to bite her. It was a quick, cruel, and accurate slash. The strike was almost too fast to track.\n\nYisha saw Han Sen use Fang, and she couldn\u2019t help but nod. Han Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife was different from her own, but it had already reached the skill ceiling. This display of his had asserted his position as one of the greatest Teeth Knife elites.\n\nSky Palace had many elites that made use of knives, and when they saw Han Sen\u2019s attack, they were surprised. Even people who didn\u2019t know about knives could tell how strong that attack was. It had reached an unbelievable level. It was no worse than the skill of a deified elite.\n\n\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t want to admit it, talent really does determine how far a person can go. Like Brother Han, for example. He can perform a knife skill as impressive as that. In Sky Palace, I am afraid only Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin can be compared to him,\u201d a Sky Palace student said with a sigh.\n\nThe next second, that same Sky Palace student felt his eyes widen. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s shocking strike had missed.\n\nAs the attack flew forward, Exquisite stood where she was and didn\u2019t move. Han Sen\u2019s attack just flashed right through her, and it didn\u2019t even ruffle her hair.\n\nExquisite\u2019s white clothes didn\u2019t even flutter in the wind as she calmly looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cContinue. Use all your power.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t move. Then he summoned his power and began to use all of his skills from Teeth Knife.\n\nTo be honest, Han Sen never really focused on knife skills, but he had tried very hard to practice them. All of his skills had become very powerful, and not many people at his level were so skilled.\n\nBut over the next few minutes, he used every Teeth Knife-derived skill that he knew. And that entire time, Exquisite stood where she was. She was unmoving. She didn\u2019t even wiggle her toes. Han Sen\u2019s knife airs flew past her harmlessly.\n\nThe Sky Palace students knew the Very High were strong, but they were still frozen. They couldn\u2019t imagine what sort of skill was being used against Han Sen. Exquisite had somehow made her opponent miss every strike without moving a finger. She hadn\u2019t been damaged in the least.\n\nNo one would think that Han Sen would make the mistake of missing his opponent, but even if he did, there was no way that all of his knife skills would fail to touch her.\n\n\u201cBrother Lone Bamboo, what power is Exquisite using? How can she avoid taking any damage when she\u2019s just standing there?\u201d Yun Suyi asked Lone Bamboo, who was beside her.\n\nLone Bamboo waited for a while before saying, \u201cShe might not have moved, but in a way, she\u2019s still hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference?\u201d Yun Sushang couldn\u2019t help herself from asking.\n\nLone Bamboo thought for a minute and then said, \u201cWe know that movement is relative. When you\u2019re flying a ship and you look out the window, it might look like the things outside are going backward instead of the ship going forward.\u201d\n\nYun Sushang heard this, and with a trembling body, she said, \u201cDo you mean Exquisite isn\u2019t the one moving, but it is actually the whole world?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that. Since she is only a ninth-tier King, her ability isn\u2019t that powerful yet. But the arena is shifting because of her, at least.\u201d Lone Bamboo nodded.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is being altered by her. That must mean that Brother Han is going to lose,\u201d Yun Suyi said with worry.\n\n\u201cMaybe not. I was just explaining what she\u2019s doing. Exquisite is still only a King class fighter. She isn\u2019t as strong as a deified creature. There is a limit to how much she can influence the world. If Han Sen goes beyond that limit, he can be the train that stops moving in a scene,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\n\u201cThey are both ninth-tier Kings? Can Brother Han\u2019s power exceed what Exquisite\u2019s strength can control?\u201d Yun Suyi looked at Lone Bamboo, expecting an answer.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lone Bamboo answered with certainty.\n\nAfter Lone Bamboo said yes, Han Sen cast Fang again.\n\n\u201cRepeating that same geno art? There\u2019s no point in using it twice,\u201d Exquisite still stood where she had started. But as she said that, she suddenly stopped and looked down.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The arena echoed with the sound of clothing being torn. Exquisite\u2019s left sleeve had been ripped off. Purple Teeth power spread across her garment.\n\n\u201cYou said using the same skill wouldn\u2019t work?\u201d Han Sen smiled at Exquisite as he spoke."
