    "text": "Han Meng\u2019er and the others finished off the remainder of the Shadow Bees effortlessly. They managed to collect a lot of xenogeneic genes through the effort, and many of them earned Shadow Bee beast souls.\n\nThe beast souls were arrows that wielded a toxic fire. When Han Meng\u2019er killed the second Duke Shadow Bee, she earned a Duke toxic arrow beast soul.\n\nWhen he saw the last of the Shadow Bees get destroyed, Night River King knew his plan had failed. In his rage, he smashed the screen he had been watching to pieces.\n\nAfter Han Sen returned to Planet Eclipse and learned of what had unfolded with the Shadow Bees, he guessed that Night River King had been behind it. Planet Eclipse did not have any Shadow Bees that were native to the place.\n\n\u201cThank God I left the Demon Bug Bai Sema behind. Otherwise, even though Han Meng\u2019er and the others would probably have survived the assault, many of my other Nobles would have been killed,\u201d Han Sen thought, relieved at how things had turned out.\n\nHan Sen knew the bee queen was still around, though. So, he assembled expeditions to go out in search of it.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee\u2019s nest was not difficult to find. She made her home in a large mountain, and the entrances that the bees had carved were clearly visible.\n\nMany Shadow Bees had been slain only a few days prior, and the Shadow Queen Bee didn\u2019t produce Shadow Bee eggs fast enough to have replaced them yet. So, Han Sen entered the beehive easily to locate the ruby-looking Shadow Queen Bee.\n\nHan Sen perused the information he had compiled on her, and he knew exactly where she had come from. Seeing the Shadow Queen Bee now made him a happy fellow.\n\nHe recognized instantly that it was a mutant Shadow Queen Bee, which was a very rare being to procure.\n\nThat being said, Han Sen had already guessed that the queen would be a mutant after hearing about the Dukes that had assaulted his base. But still, seeing the mutant Shadow Queen Bee in the flesh made him super happy.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong!\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee moved incredibly quickly. It flew around like a solidified shadow, leaving behind trailing shadows of its own. Her wings flapped so quickly, Han Sen could hardly keep track of her.\n\nMany toxic lights shone on her back, and they launched themselves at Han Sen. But each strike just landed on his Bai Sema and was rendered moot.\n\n\u201cA Duke mutant xenogeneic. So strong! This Duke\u2019s speed and the toxic light attacks, in combination with the crazy breeding speed\u2026 This would be very difficult to kill without the Demon Bug King shield,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee kept flying around Han Sen, firing her toxic darts. But against the Demon Bug Bai Sema, it was nothing.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t attack the creature, though. He figured it would be a shame to kill the mutant Shadow Queen Bee. Han Sen wanted to keep it alive so it could produce more Duke and Marquise offspring. That way, some of the scarcity of high-level resources offered by Planet Eclipse could be alleviated.\n\nSo, Han Sen hadn\u2019t gone there with the intent of killing the mutant Shadow Queen Bee. Instead, he wanted to take it and use it for himself.\n\nIf Han Sen had been a Duke, it would have been far easier for him to claim her. But he was just a Marquise, and his speed and power weren\u2019t as good as hers. It would take much effort to collect her.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee launched attacks at Han Sen furiously, but they slid harmlessly off his shield. After a while, the creature exhausted itself. Her attacks became far weaker and far slower.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee wasn\u2019t an intelligent creature, and it was a very territorial being. Although it was exhausted, he was still in her nest, and she would never consider fleeing. She still tried to fight Han Sen.\n\nSeeing her growing frustration, Han Sen decided to put away his Demon Bug Bai Sema.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee, upon seeing the Bai Sema disappear, flapped her wings to resume attacking Han Sen. She was much slower now, though.\n\nHan Sen brought out his white Jade Drum and hit it. A very deep boom of sonic power ripped out of the Drum. It clipped the tired Shadow Queen Bee and brought her down.\n\nThe Duke Jade Drum\u2019s sound shouldn\u2019t have affected a mutant Duke like her very strongly, but she was too tired by this point, so she couldn\u2019t withstand the force of that sonic shockwave.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee dragged herself off the floor, intent on going after Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was still holding the Jade Drum. He hit it another two times. The shockwaves made her roll and writhe around on the ground again. It looked as if she was in pain.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to my commands, I will spare your life,\u201d Han Sen told the Shadow Queen Bee that was now on the ground.\n\nThe Shadow Queen Bee lacked intelligence. When the Drum stopped, she tried to attack Han Sen again\u2014the intruder that had invaded her space.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what to do except continue pounding the Jade Drum, which made her roll around on the ground over and over. Some of her bee blood began to pour from her mouth. But Han Sen didn\u2019t want to kill her. Killing her would be pointless.\n\nSeeing that the Shadow Queen Bee was about to die under his repeated torture, he decided to exit the hive.\n\nA xenogeneic without proper brains had to be broken-in by slow torture over time.\n\nHan Sen stationed people to keep an eye on that beehive. If the Queen Bee made bees, they would go and kill them. That would teach her a lesson. They hoped that after a while, she might actually listen to Han Sen and obey his commands.\n\n\u201cWe will never be safe for as long as Night River King exists,\u201d Han Sen thought grimly. He considered how he might dispose of Night River King.\n\nWith the current limits of his power, Han Sen couldn\u2019t go after Night River King just yet. He needed to become a Duke, and he needed to own a lot more treasures.\n\nIt would have been best if he could use the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. That would be the only weapon he\u2019d need to take down someone that was a higher level than he was.\n\nBut even if he was able to kill Night River King, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it while he was in Narrow Moon. If they fought, the Rebate would rally behind Night River King. An outsider would never earn their favor.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I need to become a Duke quickly and find a way to take him out elsewhere.\u201d Han Sen calmed himself down and tried to think things through rationally.\n\nAllowing his anger to make him rush wouldn\u2019t solve anything. If anything, it would just reveal weaknesses for his enemies to exploit. He needed to be calm if he was going to do this.\n\n\u201cNight River King, I am going to kill you.\u201d Han Sen kept practicing. The first and fifteenth day of each month, he went to Cold Palace to absorb moon and cold powers, hastening his ascension to the rank of Duke.\n\nHan Sen dropped his blood onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum every day, too, slowly letting his essence sink into it. He wanted his blood to become one with the scorpion. Han Sen felt that he was slowly building a connection with the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. Claiming it would only be a matter of time.\n\nOne day, Black-Moon King dropped in on Han Sen unexpectedly. \u201cHan Sen, the Extreme King will be hiring knights from Narrow Moon. Are you interested in going?\u201d\n\n\u201cExtreme King recruits elites. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d want a small Marquise like me,\u201d Han Sen answered, confused. He thought they were only interested in elites like Yisha. That would require him to be at least a King.\n\n\u201cThe Extreme King will only grow and care for future elites that are showing great potential. We have a good relationship with them. When the Extreme King hire knights, they offer a few slots to us. If you would like to join them, I can get you in,\u201d Black-Moon King said."
