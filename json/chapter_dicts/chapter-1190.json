When he turned around to take a look, he saw an eight-year-old child squirming and writhing around on the ground as if in pain.\n\n\u201cBaby Ghost?\u201d Han Sen was surprised to see him there.\n\nHe was glad he was alive and had not been killed. He didn\u2019t have any green sproutlings popping up all over him, but there was definitely something wrong with him.\n\nHe used to have the face of a child, but now he was a child completely. The head was still frighteningly large, however. His lifeforce was weak, almost as weak as a newly-spawned Golden Growler.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cTalk later. For now, we should get moving.\u201d Baby Ghost clearly did not know Sky King had returned to the tree.\n\nHan Sen grabbed Baby Ghost and returned to the underground shelter with him. Then, he ordered Moment Queen to move the shelter.\n\nLittle Angel and Han Sen were weak, and in their current state, they no longer had the ability to combine together and fight Sky King. As such, they decided the best course of action was to leave.\n\nHan Sen spoke to Baby Ghost and asked, \u201cI thought you went looking for Sky King after I told you the truth of matters. What happened to you?\u201d\n\nBaby Ghost answered, \u201cI told Qing Jun, and we only went and spoke to the others. We didn\u2019t consult Sky King, but we were going to. But before the opportunity arose, the tree began to revive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, and what happened to you?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBaby Ghost explained, \u201cFortunately for me, I had Ghost Baby to escape. I abandoned my vessel and sacrificed a portion of my spirit stone to survive. I say fortunately loosely, as now I\u2019m only a shadow of what I once was. My progress has been wiped; I don\u2019t even have a single gene lock open.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust being alive is enough, Baby Ghost. Even if you\u2019re weak, being alive is more than worth the sacrifice.\u201d Han Sen smiled softly to comfort him.\n\nQing Jun was in even worse condition, though. Those that had escaped into the Cruel Bottle were all alive, but they were stuck inside the bottle and unable to exit. If they left the confines of the bottle, the Sky Tree would finish the job and absorb them. Being unable to get rid of the vines meant they\u2019d possibly be stuck inside the bottle forever.\n\nThe Cruel Bottle was like a room that operated independently to everything else, but it had to be sealed and had to remain sealed. It could not be opened, lest the Sky Tree finish what it had already started.\n\nAside from destroying the Sky Tree, Han Sen had no clue how he might proceed. There didn\u2019t seem to be any other way Han Sen could remove the vines. The creatures and spirits had each consumed too much lifewater, too, so the core of a Sky Fruit would be largely ineffective.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Han Sen decided to return to the Alliance. Little Angel and Han Sen were both still too weak, and for the time being, they wouldn\u2019t even have the strength to tackle a super creature.\n\nHan Sen rested there for two days, and after that, he started refining the Life Geno Essence of the Sky Peacock.\n\n\u201cLife Geno Essence absorbed: super geno points +1.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was delighted, hearing the announcement chime more than once. In total, the Life Geno Essence provided him four points in total.\n\nSuper creatures in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary were different. Some could give eight to nine super geno points, whereas others could only give three to four. Han Sen guessed it had something to do with the generation of a super creature, but he hadn\u2019t had much time to test and prove such theories.\n\nSky Peacock was a mount beast soul, and Han Sen considered it to be fairly useless.\n\nWhen Han Sen\u2019s condition and health improved, he didn\u2019t jump back to start hunting super creatures again. He realized he still needed a lot more strength to fight an emperor, though; he had to be careful where he next ventured.\n\nIf he combined powers with Little Angel, the cooldown period was extreme. The boost didn\u2019t last very long, either, so he knew he couldn\u2019t rely on that trick very often. It had to be used as a last resort.\n\nWhat Han Sen wanted to do most right now was research the vines and find a way in which he might remove them without destroying the Sky Tree. If he saved all the creatures and spirits inside, they\u2019d all owe him one, and they might end up following him. If that was true, he\u2019d more than have what it took to take down a king-class shelter.\n\nDragon King gave Han Sen a number of ideas, but Han Sen didn\u2019t dwell on many of them. He didn\u2019t think he should trust Dragon King as much, anymore.\n\nThat being said, Han Sen understood Dragon King never wanted to bring harm to him. Dragon King had made a simple blunder, and the results of his time in Immortal Shelter did not come about through some evil machination or scheme the spirit had hatched, as Moment Queen might do. After all, if something bad happened to Han Sen and he was killed, that would be game over for Dragon King, too.\n\nSo, more than anything, Han Sen had just called Dragon King\u2019s overall intelligence into question. It boggled Han Sen\u2019s mind how someone so dumb might have once been an emperor.\n\n\u201cPlease have faith in me. I have a plan. This could really work.\u201d Dragon King felt sorry for what had happened and desperately wanted to get back into Han Sen\u2019s good books.\n\nDragon King was relying on Han Sen to find him a vessel, after all.\n\n\u201cThe Asura Sutra can get rid of those vines,\u201d he said, but Han Sen struggled to believe it.\n\n\u201cIf you practice the Asura Sutra, you can fix them. Back then\u2026\u201d Dragon King realized he had said something he should not have mentioned.\n\n\u201cBack then what?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King knew, if he didn\u2019t play his cards right and only do good for Han Sen, he\u2019d be trapped in the ring for all eternity.\n\n\u201cAsura was one of the generals who beat Sky King. His Asura Sutra is bad for the tree, but you would need to find a spirit of that bloodline to perform it,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say Sky King was an emperor? And Ancient Devil Emperor beat Sky King himself? So Asura was just a general, but he was able to defeat Sky King, too?\u201d Han Sen thought there were inconsistencies in the spirit\u2019s tales, and he wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he should give Dragon King the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut Dragon King then explained, \u201cFolk of the Asura bloodline can defeat Sky King. Besides, he betrayed Mister Ancient Devil. You remember Devil\u2019s Realm and Ancient Devil Shelter, don\u2019t you? That was the consequence of his betrayal.\u201d"
