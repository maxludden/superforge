    "text": "Han Sen took a closer look and saw that there were holographic images of weapons in the making, which proved that the weapons were all handmade\n\nAfter reviewing the images, Han Sen dialed the number on the webpage.\n\nSomeone answered, but didn\u2019t allow video chat. Han Sen could only hear his voice.\n\n\"How can I help you?\" the owner asked in a low male voice.\n\n\"I saw on the forum that you sell weapons. Do you have arrows with higher percentage of Z-steel?\" Han Sen did not expect that the content of Z-steel could really reach 1.2 percent. He\u2019d be happy if it reached 0.8 percent.\n\n\"I have two arrows made by myself. 1.2 percent Z-steel. Three hundred thousand each,\" replied the man.\n\n\"I want one. Where can I check it out?\" asked Han Sen.\n\n\"I\u2019ll tell you the address,\" the man gave him an address and hung up.\n\nHan Sen followed the address to a red-light district. Although it was already the middle of the night, the streets were still crowded.\n\nHan Sen waited for a while at the agreed spot and saw someone waving at him across the street. Hansen warily walked over to him.\n\n\"You want to buy an arrow?\" asked a guy in sunglasses and hoodie. Han Sen could only tell he was a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Yes,\" Han Sen nodded.\n\nThe man took out a box and placed it in front of Han Sen. He opened it up and there was a black steel arrow inside.\n\n\"Can I test it?\" asked Han Sen.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" replied the man casually.\n\nHan Sen took the arrow out and tested its balance. If an arrow wasn\u2019t balanced, it didn\u2019t matter what material it was made from.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Han Sen found this arrow had better balance than Saber arrows. If the bow was strong enough, this arrow would always maintain stability.\n\nThe man nodded and did not say anything.\n\nHen Sen pulled out his broadsword and asked the man, \"Can I test it with my own weapon?\" Without his permission, Han Sen didn\u2019t dare to test it that way. But technically speaking, if the arrow contained more than 0.7 percent Z-steel, his broadsword wouldn\u2019t even leave a mark on it.\n\nThe man looked at the broadsword in Han Sen\u2019s hands and again said, \"Suit yourself.\"\n\nWith his permission, taking the arrow in one hand and the broadsword in the other, Han Sen fiercely slashed the broadsword at the arrow.\n\nClang!\n\nHan Sen checked the arrow and was pleased to see there were no mark on the arrow, while his broadsword was chipped.\n\nAlthough he wasn\u2019t sure if the Z-steel content reached 1.2 percent, he knew it was great stuff.\n\n\"Great stuff. I\u2019ll take it.\" Hansen took out the three hundred thousand dollars he had brought with him and paid the man.\n\n\"Of course, it was made from the bearing steel of old interstellar warships, hence the Z-steel content is a standard 1.2 percent. Also the machine-made weapons are no match for my products. Let me know if you need something in the future,\" the man said and disappeared in the back lane.\n\nHan Sen returned home and tested the arrow more thoroughly. It was truly great, similar to the name-brand arrows, and only one-tenth of the price.\n\n\"I was really lucky to find a true craftsman.\" Han Sen hadn\u2019t had high hopes because a lot of sellers of handmade weapons only produced mediocre products. For weapons like arrows that required a lot of skills to make, it was even less likely to find good ones from independent sellers.\n\nHan Sen was very satisfied with this arrow. Just the tip of the arrow showed incredible craftsmanship, as it must have been manually polished to be so sharp. Han Sen had briefly learned weapon-making at school, but his work was not the high caliber of this weapon maker.\n\n\"It is a good arrow, but unfortunately I can only afford one. If I don\u2019t hit the target, there won\u2019t be a second chance.\" Han Sen checked his bank account and found he had less than one hundred thousand dollars left.\n\n\"I wish I could buy something with it tomorrow.\" Han Sen slept for a while and teleported to God\u2019s Sanctuary early in the morning.\n\nIn Qin Xuan\u2019s Steel Armor Gang, Bullseye was the smallest team. Few people among civilians were interested in archery, so most Bullseye members had military background and could enter military schools if their scores qualified.\n\nWhen they entered God\u2019s Sanctuary, they would report with the military force into the shelter they were assigned. Qin Xuan's Steel Armor Gang was the military force in Steel Armor Shelter.\n\nThe Alliance didn\u2019t have much power over God\u2019s Sanctuary, but it still maintained some control. In each shelter, the largest gang typically had military background.\n\nQin Xuan led her people to the agreed place, and Son of Heaven\u2019s gang was already there. Compared to Steel Armor Gang, Son of Heaven\u2019s gang seemed rather unorganized.\n\nLuo Tianyang gave Han Sen, who was in the crowd, a cold stare and judging by his look, Han Sen knew their business was not finished.\n\nAfter the two sides joined, Son of Heaven\u2019s gang led the way, marching into the mountains. Bullseye\u2019s place was at the end of the line, and Han Sen and Su Xiaoqiao were walking behind everyone else.\n\n\"Sen, I think we should each bring a shield, to protect ourselves,\" Su Xiaoqiao said.\n\n\"You're rich. Just buy a suit of Z-steel armor,\" said Han Sen.\n\n\"Z-steel is so heavy and not as portable as beast soul armors. And even primitive beast soul armors are tougher than Z-steel armor, unless the Z-steel content exceeds 10 percent. You know we could only find weapons with at most 1 percent Z-steel. So beast soul armors are in general much better.\" Su Xiaqiao continued to say, \" How nice if I could have the same beast soul armor as Dollar\u2019s. That\u2019s the only sacred-blood beast soul armor I\u2019ve seen in Steel Armor Shelter. I wonder what beast soul it was.\"\n\n\"From its look, I think it must be a fierce and mighty beast soul,\" another Bullseye member jumped in.\n\n\"That goes without saying. It must be a from phenomenal sacred-blood creature,\" others agreed.\n\nHan Sen chuckled silently and wondered what they would say had they known the armor was from the weakest creature, black beetle."
