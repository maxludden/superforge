Although the knights were all Kings who had powerful areas, most of the knights weren\u2019t using their powers.\n\nThey had been split up into teams, and every team had a leader. Under the leader\u2019s command, the Kings released their powers and areas one by one. The process was smooth, and there were no errors or faults. The knights worked together like a well-oiled machine, and the fight was precise, tidy, and unhindered.\n\nHan Sen had allowed Bubble to take on his appearance and play chess. Meanwhile, he snuck into the battleground. He hid between the asteroids so he could watch the crazy fight unfold.\n\nHan Sen had to compliment them. There were many elites in the Extreme King. For every one hundred Kings, there were twenty to thirty half-deifieds. They had all kinds of powers, which could be used in any way they deemed suitable.\n\nThe half-deifieds that could use Galaxy Teleportation were the types that Dia Robber and Dragon One had spent so much time looking for. The royal knights had two soldiers with those powers.\n\nThe powers of the various knights were utilized very well. They trapped the giant blue gem eyeball within their circle, and no matter how many times the blue gem eyeball released its blue light, it couldn\u2019t break out of its cage. It was unable to hurt the members of the royal knights.\n\nThe power that bound the creature was completely silent, and Bai Wan Jie hovered to the side as he watched the fight. He didn\u2019t even participate in the actual battle. But Han Sen had noticed that the leader of the knights seemed to have a heart. The man used his heart to command the knights, and that was why their performance had been so flawless.\n\n\u201cSo strong. The Extreme King\u2019s geniuses are too strong compared to the geniuses of other races. Any of their Kings that awaken their king bodies have a great chance of becoming deified. Compared to the other high races that must practice for so long, having a king body is like using a cheat code.\u201d Han Sen sighed. He was very hopeful about humans.\n\nEvery human that came from the Sanctuary had a super god body. If their development was spurred and humans eventually developed an army, it would be stronger than any army of the Extreme King.\n\nHowever, in this fight, even the powerful Extreme King knights surrounding the Sea Sky Eye were unable to hurt it.\n\nThe Sea Sky Eye kept dancing and releasing blue lights. Although it couldn\u2019t escape the circle of knights, its enemies were still unable to hurt it.\n\nHan Sen continued to watch the battle proceed for a while longer. The reason the Extreme King knights couldn\u2019t injure the Sky Eye was simple; the Sky Eye had a special eye skill.\n\nNo matter how complicated the attacks of the Extreme King knights were or how perfectly they cooperated, the Sky Eye was impervious to all their attacks. It wouldn\u2019t allow any powers to land on it.\n\n\u201cIf this continues, the royal knights are going to lose,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nAfter all, the Sea Sky Eye casually brushed off every attack of the royal knights. The knights had much more difficulty resisting the eye\u2019s attacks, by comparison. Using group Galaxy Teleportation was particularly exhausting for the Extreme King soldiers. Casting that geno cost a lot of energy, and after a few uses, the caster would grow tired.\n\n\u201cBai Wan Jie must have another trick up his sleeve, right?\u201d Han Sen was still hiding, not yet planning on doing anything. He just watched the scary fight play out.\n\nThe powers being used in the fight were flashing across space, causing the darkness itself to shake. Normal people would see it all like a rainbow light in space, with a few shockwaves causing the light to ripple and jump. They wouldn\u2019t see anything in detail.\n\nHan Sen was so far away, but he had his Purple-Eye Butterfly and Spell sniper rifle. His view of the battle was crystal clear, which allowed him to keep up with every attack and parry. As he watched, he was learning a lot.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that ice element skills could be used that way\u2026 And that must be a metal area\u2026\u201d While Han Sen watched with interest, the Sea Sky Eye suddenly became brighter. The moon-like Sea Sky Eye lit up. It was now like a sun that was releasing blue light.\n\nA blue glow spread along its substance chains, breaking the areas of the knights effortlessly. They were completely helpless to stop it. The blue light was everywhere, and there was nothing they could do to evade it. From the looks of it, one hundred royal knights were about to be killed on the spot.\n\nBai Wan Jie, who was watching the fight, finally moved. He was holding a staff that looked as if it had been made of platinum. A crystal ball was mounted on the top of the staff, and when Bai Wan Jie raised his staff, the crystal ball began to shine. It released some transparent substance chains, which shielded the royal knights with a screen of crystal.\n\nWhen the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s blue light struck that layer of crystal, the light disappeared. It was actually unable to break through that layer of crystal.\n\n\u201cWhat is that staff? How does it possess so much power?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Bai Wan Jie was just half-deified. Even if he was wielding a deified weapon, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to trigger a deified substance chain.\n\nBut now, Bai Wan Jie was using his staff to protect all the royal knights from the attacks of the Sea Sky Eye. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what to make of the sight.\n\n\u201cAttack!\u201d Bai Wan Jie raised his staff. The transparent substance chain kept buffing the knights, and the knights surged forward like a legion of the undead. Suddenly, none of them were afraid of the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s power anymore, so they stopped defending themselves and focused all their strength on attacking.\n\nThe Sea Sky Eye was strangely enraged. The blue light it wielded was so strong that it looked like an angry blue star. Han Sen could barely look in the creature\u2019s direction. But even so, the Sea Sky Eye couldn\u2019t break the defense of the transparent substance chain.\n\nThe powers of the knights finally landed on the creature, but they weren\u2019t very effective. They could barely damage the Sea Sky Eye.\n\nHan Sen used his sniper rifle to aim at Bai Wan Jie. The man\u2019s body was releasing a white light. The staff sucked in the light he was producing, then pumped out transparent substance chains in return.\n\n\u201cWeird. Bai Wan Jie is fueling the staff with his own power, but he\u2019s obviously producing way more power than a half-deified should be capable of. At the rate that the staff\u2019s draining his strength, even Dragon One would only last for a few seconds. But Bai Wan Jie is maintaining that output, and he has yet to look exhausted. That isn\u2019t normal,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBai Wan Jie did look pale, but he wasn\u2019t about to collapse.\n\nBzzt!\n\nAs Han Sen watched Bai Wan Jie, something happened to the Sea Sky Eye."
