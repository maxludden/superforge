    "text": "\u201cLeave me here and go on.\u201d Han Sen could see that Exquisite\u2019s face was drenched in sweat, and the energy flows in her body weren\u2019t circulating correctly. He knew she had used Galaxy Teleport too many times. Her body had a limit, and she was almost tapped out.\n\nBut Exquisite ignored what Han Sen told her. She thought for a minute, then said, \u201cI have found a way. We will teleport to Bao Lian. Bao Lian won\u2019t let himself be trapped in the same God Spirit Storm he placed on you. So, if we followed where he went, we might be able to find a way to erase the power he put on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is useless. We won\u2019t be able to find him now.\u201d Han Sen shook his head with a tired smile.\n\nExquisite teleported away again, and her eyes slowly changed color. Her eyes darted here and there, but she couldn\u2019t latch onto an image of Bao Lian.\n\n\u201cStop searching. He must have left the god area. He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to go down with us,\u201d Han Sen said. He had already figured as much, and this simply confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\u201cThere must be a way.\u201d Exquisite\u2019s face looked different from how it usually did, and that was because she was out of options. She could not control a place like the god area.\n\n\u201cSeriously. You should go. The God Spirit Storm is coming after me, and I\u2019m the one that challenged Bao Lian to a deathmatch. This is my responsibility,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cYou are my silkworm. I\u2019m not going to let you die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that to the Very High, silkworms are just instruments to you. If I was to die, you would just find another one,\u201d Han Sen said, meeting Exquisite\u2019s eyes.\n\nExquisite shivered. It was just as Han Sen said; silkworms were little more than tools used in the progression and ascension of the Very High. And Han Sen wasn\u2019t the only person who thought that. The Very High who studied the Very High Sense thought that silkworms were nothing more than toys of the universe. They looked at most people and creatures of different races like that.\n\nRight now, Exquisite was caught in an inner conflict. According to what she had been taught by her people, her course of action was clear. She should simply leave and select another silkworm.\n\nBut for some reason, Exquisite didn\u2019t want to do this. She knew it wasn\u2019t helping, but she kept teleporting Han Sen away, again and again.\n\nShe didn\u2019t go to Li Keer, either. Doing so would have been pointless. It would just force Li Keer to flee with them, and things would continue to go downhill.\n\n\u201cHe is such a powerful silkworm. I will never find another one like one. If I\u2019m to succeed in this life, I need someone like him. I must do what I can to save him.\u201d Exquisite said all this to herself. Every time she teleported, she looked for a way in which she might be able to help Han Sen.\n\nBut no matter what she tried, there didn\u2019t seem to be a way out of this predicament. There was nothing she could do to escape. Although the Very High were considered incredibly powerful, only a deified could sort this out. Exquisite was far too weak right now.\n\nExquisite\u2019s aura became more and more disrupted, and her eyes were deeply bloodshot. Her face was colored a deep scarlet. Han Sen knew she had reached the end of her rope. She looked exhausted.\n\nHan Sen felt so touched by her dedication, but he was also in a hurry. For reasons that he didn\u2019t dare think about while she was nearby, he needed Exquisite to leave him alone for a moment.\n\nBut Exquisite was too stubborn to leave him by himself. Her lifeforce was messed up, but she still used Galaxy Teleport to haul Han Sen around.\n\nAfter using Galaxy Teleport again, Exquisite fell into a coughing fit. Blood speckled her lips. She had used too much energy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for your determination, but you should leave. I will find a way to survive,\u201d Han Sen murmured, supporting Exquisite\u2019s shaking body as she coughed.\n\nExquisite wiped the blood from her mouth. She looked at the sky and saw the black clouds and the thunder. Her face was expressionless as she said, \u201cIf I cannot even save my silkworm\u2019s life, how can I unlock the full potential of Sky and Man Combine Together?\u201d\n\nWhen he heard her say that, Han Sen felt even more worried. Despite their dire situation, Exquisite was still refusing to leave.\n\nAs the God Spirit Storm formed again, Exquisite grabbed Han Sen and used God\u2019s Wander to teleport away.\n\nBut this time, when they reappeared, Han Sen realized they weren\u2019t far enough from the God Spirit Storm to reset the cycle. Exquisite had simply used up too much of her power, and she didn\u2019t have enough juice left in her. Jumps like this wouldn\u2019t take them far enough.\n\nExquisite noticed they were still under the same God Spirit Storm, and her face went grey. She tried to use more power to teleport again, but as soon as she moved, she coughed up even more blood.\n\nHer body was too exhausted to use Galaxy Teleport any longer.\n\nAs Exquisite\u2019s body shivered and shook, Han Sen felt sick. If Exquisite had left, he could have easily sorted out this situation. But Exquisite\u2019s strong will was causing him more and more trouble.\n\nEven so, Exquisite\u2019s determination touched Han Sen deeply. After all, the whole reason Exquisite had stayed by his side was because of her desire to save him.\n\n\u201cHow many people exist who would truly sacrifice themselves on behalf of another? The Very High are a very complicated race, but why do people claim they are heartless?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nExquisite sensed what Han Sen was thinking, and an unreadable expression passed over her face. She looked at the sky and the God Spirit Storm coming, but she couldn\u2019t move away.\n\nExquisite suddenly turned to him. \u201cHan Sen, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be leaving here alive today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to die,\u201d Han Sen said quietly. He used the small jade figure to stop the sync of his seven senses. Exquisite could no longer feel his mind and emotions.\n\nExquisite kept talking as if she hadn\u2019t heard what Han Sen had said. \u201cI used to think that my little sister\u2019s choices were ridiculous. I thought that the Very High Sense was the pride of the Very High, the legacy of our race. Little Sister wasn\u2019t proud of our legacy. She always found ways to get around practicing the Very High Sense, too. She even got lazy, and I could never understand why.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen could respond, Exquisite carried on by saying, \u201cBut now I seem to understand; having a heart that connects to the entire universe feels rather empty. The Very High forget about love. This teaching has been with our race for as long as we can remember. But despite all that, each one of us is just another creature of the universe. We aren\u2019t machines. Sometimes, having a little heart can be quite attractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to practice the Very High Sense,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cI have no choice. Your fate within the Very High is determined for you when you are born. Li Keer didn\u2019t have a choice. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I thought Liyu Zhen was sad, considering that he would never have the chance to practice the Very High Sense. But now I envy him and the others. If I had the choice, I would prefer to be like them. I don\u2019t want to practice the Very High Sense. I want to be like a normal member of the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d Exquisite said coldly, watching the God Spirit Storm sweep toward them. She sounded very calm. She almost sounded relieved. Either way, she didn\u2019t fear death."
