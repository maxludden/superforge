    "text": "The little cat was only around the size of a man\u2019s hand. It looked very cute, and its legs were pink in color. The contrast between the pink fur of its legs and the white fur of its body was quite lovely.\n\nThe woman picked up the cat from the ground and placed it in her hands. Han Sen could see the woman\u2019s hands in the video. Her fingers were long and delicate, and her skin was flawless. Her hands were beautiful. She didn\u2019t have long nails or any adornments or accessories like rings.\n\nShe placed the little white cat inside a transparent container. Then she put on a pair of disposable gloves, the type commonly used for doing experiments, and brought out a needle. She injected an unknown fluid into the little white cat.\n\nAfter receiving the injection, the little white cat quickly fell asleep. The video then remained trained on the sleeping cat. It was like the woman was just standing still, holding the camera steady.\n\nBut after a while had passed, Han Sen realized that the woman couldn\u2019t have been standing there all that time. She must have put the device in a corner and left it running.\n\nBecause nothing much was happening on the screen, Han Sen fast-forwarded through the video file. He noticed something shocking at the video sped forward. The sleeping white cat grew twice as big overnight. The video ended like that.\n\nHan Sen opened the second video. The image seemed to be the same. He could see the little white cat inside the transparent container. But shortly after, the little white cat woke up, and the woman wearing disposable gloves reappeared. Once again, she gave the little white cat an injection.\n\nThe little white cat, who had just woken back up, was put to sleep again. The woman stroked the little creature\u2019s head and said in a soothing voice, \u201cMy good child. You must make it. Mama believes in you.\u201d\n\nInjection\u2026 sleep\u2026 injection\u2026 sleep\u2026\n\nThis process seemed to go on forever. And in this cycle, for seven days, the little white cat grew to the size of an adult tiger.\n\nAs it grew larger, the little white cat began to look more and more familiar.\n\n\u201cIs that actually the white tiger outside?\u201d Han Sen wondered. Honestly, though, he was not too surprised by the revelation.\n\nAnd then, the cycle continued. The little white cat didn\u2019t spend much time awake. For most of the video, it slept under the influence of the injections.\n\nBut its body was continuing to grow. It was now much larger than the mushroom-headed white tiger that inhabited this island.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, the woman discovered that the little white cat had a small and delicate mushroom on its head. Although the mushroom was just the size of a bean, the woman was surprised and said, \u201cKid, you made it.\u201d\n\nAfter that day, the white cat and the mushroom continued to grow bigger and bigger. The woman\u2019s tests also continued.\n\nOn the thirty-seventh day, the white cat had become a mammoth-like beast. The container was no longer big enough to contain it. While it slept, she opened the container and stood next to the giant white cat\u2019s head. It was like she was taking a selfie. She filmed herself and the little white cat together.\n\nThis was the first time Han Sen had seen the woman\u2019s face. Previously, he had only heard her voice and seen her hands and arms.\n\nWhen he saw the woman\u2019s face, he couldn\u2019t help but scream, \u201cIs that her?\u201d\n\nThe woman in the video was wearing a white lab coat. She had a ponytail, and she was wearing black glasses. She was the woman that had been trapped in Two World Mountain. But she seemed to be a very different person here than she had been when Han Sen met her. She was softer here, although compared to the average person, her personality would still seem distant and reserved.\n\n\u201cIs that her ship? Has she been here before? How did she get out?\u201d Han Sen thought excitedly.\n\nIf that woman had come here and managed to escape, then he should be able to get out, too. But Han Sen didn\u2019t know how the woman had managed to get out.\n\nAnd Han Sen was a little confused about why the woman hadn\u2019t taken her guinea pig with her when she left.\n\nHan Sen needed to find answers to the questions that the video had raised, but the videos came to an end there. He had watched the last one. The final video ended with her and the little white cat sharing a selfie.\n\n\u201cD*mn it! Couldn\u2019t you have filmed a little more?\u201d Han Sen thought in frustration. But at least he had found out that escape from this realm was possible. So that was good news, at least.\n\nHan Sen watched the video to the end, but he didn\u2019t learn anything else. The video just filmed the white cat, and the camera remained in a fixed position. Aside from the selfie at the end, it was almost all filmed from the same angle.\n\n\u201cCaptain! This is so bad\u2026 Captain! Something is climbing up the island!\u201d a pirate shouted as he knocked on Han Sen\u2019s door.\n\nHan Sen switched off the video, exited his room, and went straight to the command deck. There, he saw that creatures were emerging from the black sea. They were like black snakes. They were as thick as barrels, and their heads were serpentine. Their mouths were oddly squarish when they opened, but they possessed many fangs. They looked very scary.\n\n\u201cThere are living creatures in the black sea?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. The corrosive powers of the black sea had been beyond even the deified white whale\u2019s ability to withstand. It was hard to imagine how such creatures could survive in that sea.\n\nWhen those weird snakes emerged, they started to eat the mushrooms on the land.\n\nAlthough there were many mushrooms, there were many black snakes, too. It wasn\u2019t long before they had eaten a few acres\u2019 worth of mushrooms.\n\n\u201cMeow!\u201d came a sharp cry. The white tiger swooped in from the sky, slashing with its claws. The bodies of numerous snakes were ripped apart.\n\nThe injured snakes bled a black juice, but their broken bodies still tried to bring down the white tiger.\n\nThe white tiger slammed its paws down to squish the heads of the snakes into jelly.\n\nThe white tiger didn\u2019t seem to possess area attacks, but its power and speed were very impressive. Its abilities seemed to be deified.\n\nThe white tiger shifted, and it suddenly became a group of white tigers that descended on the horde of weird snakes.\n\nHan Sen knew from the white tiger\u2019s speed that these were not doppelgangers. The tiger was simply moving so quickly that it was leaving behind afterimages. His vision couldn\u2019t follow the speed at which the creature went.\n\nEverywhere the white tiger went, black heads were torn from serpentine bodies. A few minutes later, the ground was littered with the broken bodies of a few hundred weird snakes. The surviving snakes returned to the depths of the black sea.\n\nThe dead black snakes rotted very quickly. They dissolved into black juices on the ground. Most of them slowly trickled back to the black sea, whereas others dried up on land.\n\nAfter all the weird black snakes returned to the black sea, the white tiger roared at the sea, then turned around and went back to the mushroom forest."
