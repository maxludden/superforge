    "text": "The woman seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. She smiled at Han Sen, but she did not say anything. Quietly, she continued eating her meal.\n\nHan Sen thought that the woman was definitely a suspicious character, but he could not be sure if she was the traitor of the Destroyed or not.\n\nHan Sen thought of something, but a Dragon man was already approaching his table. He sat down next to Han Sen, then looked at Zero and the rest of the girls. \u201cMarquise Han, I have heard that one of your female Marquises used one arrow to almost completely obliterate Barr. That is a most impressive feat. I must wonder which of your companions were able to do such a thing? Could you tell me?\u201d\n\nWhen the Dragon man spoke, the whole restaurant became deathly quiet. Everyone turned to look at their table.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Dragon man with a quizzical expression. He had obviously been sent to verify and confirm the identity of Han Sen\u2019s companions. Han Sen wasn\u2019t surprised by this, but it was strange how a connection was drawn via the attack on Barr.\n\nWhen Barr heard the Dragon man speak, he did not move. Obviously, Barr had to be afraid of the figure.\n\nIf the man next to Han Sen was able to stay Barr\u2019s hand through fear, though, then he had to be someone of profound notoriety.\n\nHan Sen kept his gaze on the Dragon man. \u201cThis is my daughter Han Meng\u2019er. Those two are my sisters. And this is Flower King\u2019s daughter from Narrow Moon. Her name is Qing Li. As for this Feather friend, I must admit I do not know her.\u201d Han Sen introduced the rest on his table, but he didn\u2019t mention Little Silver or Little Star.\n\nAfter the Dragon man heard what he said, he turned his eyes to the Feather woman. He looked at her and asked,\n\n\u201cWhere have you come from? What business brings you here?\u201d\n\nThe Dragon man\u2019s behavior made Han Sen certain that the Destroyed traitor was in-fact a woman. Either that, or the traitor at least had the ability to present themselves as a woman. If this was not the case, then the Dragon man would have been sure to ask for the identity of Little Silver and Little Star. His interest remained fixed on the women, though. His sudden focus on the Feather woman made it very obvious. Han Sen didn\u2019t think he was even bothering to hide it.\n\nThe Feather woman smiled and looked at the Dragon man. \u201cI know of you, Dragon Six. Your title is Toxic Dragon Old Six. And while you are a Dragon Duke, I don\u2019t have to answer your questions. This place does not belong to the Dragon.\u201d\n\nToxic Dragon Old Six froze. He looked at the Feather woman and smiled. \u201cIf you know who I am, then you must be aware of what I can do. You should spare yourself the trouble and cooperate. I would not like to destroy a woman.\u201d\n\nBut that Feather paid no mind to Toxic Dragon Old Six\u2019s threat. She smiled and said, \u201cIf I am the person you are looking for, killing me wouldn\u2019t get you what you want. And if I am not the correct person, and you did kill me, you won\u2019t get what you want and people will become suspicious. They will think that perhaps you were the one that took it. I don\u2019t think there is any sound reason for you to kill me here. So, why should I cooperate with you? I might be mistaken, of course. Are you cruel enough to slay me right here? If that is the case, then so be it.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the Feather woman elegantly returned to eating her dish. She totally ignored the simmering anger of Toxic Dragon Old Six.\n\nThe muscles in the Dragon\u2019s jaw tightened, and he laughed darkly. \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. There are ten thousand ways to make you wish you were dead. That is what I am going to do to you.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Toxic Dragon Old Six\u2019s dragon hand clutched a dragon knife. He slowly moved to grab the woman\u2019s head.\n\nBut the Feather woman kept eating as if she hadn\u2019t seen it coming. Either that, or she was willing to concede. She ignored Toxic Dragon Old Six\u2019s hand completely.\n\n\u201cDragon Six, this is where you eat. This isn\u2019t where you sh*t. Even if she was the traitor of the Destroyed, you should allow us, the Destroyed, to do this ourselves. This is none of your business,\u201d a Destroyed Duke said coldly.\n\nWhen Dragon Six heard that intrusion, his hand stilled. He looked at the Destroyed Duke and grinned. \u201cYou want to get me mad and goad me into killing her, just so everyone turns their attention to me? Good idea, but I\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Toxic Dragon Old Six returned his gaze to the Feather woman. He lowered his hand, got up, and returned to sit with the rest of the Dragon.\n\nHan Sen was entertained. Whether or not the woman was the Destroyed traitor, she was a powerful character. If she wasn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t have remained so chill.\n\nHan Sen could see that Dragon Six wasn\u2019t going to kill her right there, but she was very calm. And it only took her a few sentences to talk down suspicions of her identity. She made people uncertain of what to do with her. She seemed rather dangerous, but it brought an air of balance to her character. There were not many people that were able to do such a thing.Read comics on our ReadReadNovelFull.live\n\nThere were too many suspicious things about her, though. Even if she didn\u2019t say anything more, she was still attracting every eye in the establishment. But no one would do anything to her before they figured this out. There were too many factions present with too much at stake.\n\n\u201cI am full. I appreciate you allowing me to sit here. I believe we will meet again.\u201d The Feather woman smiled at Han Sen, then she got up and went upstairs. She was living there.\n\n\u201cPowerful woman. Might she really be the traitor?\u201d Qing Li pursed her lips.\n\n\u201cWho knows? Maybe she is. Maybe she isn\u2019t.\u201d Han Sen looked around him, and he noticed all the other races were staring at them.\n\nThat woman had established a connection between him and her. And because they were suspicious about her, the association made them suspicious about him and his own companions.\n\nAfter eating, Han Sen took his companions outside. He noticed that every elite was now gathered in Steel City. The whole town was locked down. You could only get in, and you could not get out. Apparently, the authorities believed that the traitor was indeed located somewhere in Steel City.\n\nThat was a fairly sensible conclusion, or at least, Han Sen thought so. The only place to hide on Planet Sodi was in its sole city, and finding the traitor amongst the hordes of Marquises there would be a very trying task.\n\nBut Han Sen had to wonder why the traitor had selected Planet Sodi. And he pondered what the traitor\u2019s escape plan might be.\n\nIf the traitor was really there, the person might be very difficult to locate. Of course, it was only a matter of time. They would find the traitor, sooner or later. And if the traitor came here, she had to have been prepared. And if the traitor was prepared, then she had to have an escape plan. Han Sen could not think of a way in which he might manage that, though.\n\nHan Sen was giving the matter a lot of thought because he now wanted the Destroyed Bible for himself. If he was able to find the traitor before everyone else, he could take it without anyone noticing. He could throw it back into the sanctuaries, and that way, no one would ever find it. It would remain hidden even if people thought he was the culprit.\n\nBut right now, not even Han Sen knew who the traitor was. He did not know if the traitor had brought the Destroyed Bible with them, either."
