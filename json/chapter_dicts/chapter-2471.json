    "text": "\u201cTwo more hits!\u201d Lando said, plumes of icy air flowing over his lips. He behaved as if nothing had happened at all.\n\n\u201cThis guy is really scary, but I have only unlocked the first tier of Jadeskin. If I was also half-deified, he wouldn\u2019t be acting so cocky.\u201d Han Sen took two steps back and frowned.\n\nAfter pausing, Han Sen had an idea. He gathered up power in his fist once more.\n\nBut this time, he didn\u2019t punch Lando once. He cast a continuous punch, but the power was unleashed at an extremely slow speed. It was as if it was crawling like a snail.\n\nAll of a sudden, Han Sen cast countless punches. The power of each punch was like a wave, and as they swept forward, they gathered together to become a terrifying force.\n\nAs Han Sen kept attacking, the waves built up. The scary powers were multiplied. It was like a tsunami was now headed for Lando.\n\nThe sea of clouds all around was shoved out of the way by Han Sen\u2019s waves. They created a large vacuum zone. The scary power coming for Lando was like the wind blowing through the galaxy.\n\nLando\u2019s muscles tightened up. The muscles in his body were moaning with the groans of the Dragon. He didn\u2019t attempt to avoid it. He simply endured the power unleashed by Han Sen\u2014power that had been multiplied several times.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s power came down on Lando\u2019s body, annihilating his armor. That multiplied force of the attack was mind-blowing. Lando\u2019s King class armor was turned to dust, and the remaining fragments were scattered everywhere. They glittered around him like a cloud of tiny stars.\n\nBut when the scary power came crashing against Lando\u2019s muscles, the blood vessels were highlighted so well that they looked like tattoos. The shockwave-like attack struck Lando\u2019s muscles, and the attack crumbled. Lando\u2019s body remained uninjured.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful body.\u201d Han Sen looked at Lando in shock. Although Han Sen hadn\u2019t expected to defeat Lando with that hit, he expected it to send the man staggering back. He didn\u2019t even twitch, though. That made Han Sen feel afraid.\n\n\u201cYou only have one strike remaining.\u201d Lando\u2019s body was completely naked. His strong chest was emblazoned with a tattoo of a dragon. His face was impassive as he spoke.\n\nHan Sen went silent for a bit, and then he pulled out his Thunder God Spike. \u201cIn that case, it\u2019s time to bring out the big guns. I hope you don\u2019t blame me later for what\u2019s about to happen.\u201d\n\nThe Thunder God Spike wasn\u2019t a very destructive tool, but its paralytic power was difficult to withstand. Even a deified being would feel a blow from this weapon. No matter how strong Lando was, he couldn\u2019t be any stronger than a deified.\n\nThinking of all this, Han Sen placed his power into the Thunder God Spike. Power crackled across the Thunder God Spike, bursting into waving colors like the northern lights.\n\n\u201cYou really aren\u2019t going to dodge this thing?\u201d Han Sen asked, lifting the Thunder God Spike and looking at Lando.\n\nLando didn\u2019t respond, but there was an obvious, albeit unspoken desire for Han Sen to just hurry up and get on with things.\n\nHan Sen was fine with that. He lifted his Thunder God Spike, aiming it to strike Lando in the head. He knew he would be unable to crack the man\u2019s head open, but the sheer amount of power that the spike could deliver should be enough to make Lando move.\n\nPang!\n\nThe lightning crackling all around the Thunder God Spike connected with the side of Lando\u2019s head, and the streaks of silver power went straight into his skull.\n\nLando\u2019s head jerked back. Han Sen was so happy about this, and he thought this was sure to be the one. But Lando only moved his head. His entire body didn\u2019t move.\n\nSilver light streaked over Lando\u2019s head, and white smoke streamed from his hair, but he didn\u2019t seem to react to the hit. He straightened his neck out, and while lightning still flashed across the Thunder God Spike, it didn\u2019t seem to bother him.\n\nHan Sen was frozen. He couldn\u2019t summon words to speak. His body was strong too, but even he couldn\u2019t have endured the hit he had just dished out. Lando\u2019s complete lack of reaction was stunning.\n\nLando used his fingers to touch the Thunder God Spike. He pushed it aside and said, \u201cMy body is already destroyed. There is no sensation within me. Pain, numbness, and dizziness don\u2019t exist in my body. The numbing effect brought on by lightning is ineffective against someone like me. All that did was give me a tiny buzz of electricity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. No wonder the Thunder God Spike didn\u2019t work on you,\u201d Han Sen said with a wry smile.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lando turned around to leave.\n\nHan Sen hesitated a moment, but he did follow. He had no plans to escape.\n\n\u201cYou planned to keep your promise.\u201d Lando looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cNot really. But I knew trying to escape from you would be futile.\u201d Han Sen shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cYou are an honest man,\u201d Lando said with surprise.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything, but inside, he thought to himself, \u201cI can\u2019t even tell which direction we are headed. I don\u2019t even know where Bao\u2019er is. Running around the Tianxia System won\u2019t solve anything. There must be many people like Lando after me. It\u2019s best to follow him now. If I run into any trouble up ahead, he will protect me. This isn\u2019t a bad idea for the time being.\u201d\n\nHan Sen followed Lando. Since the Dragon noticed that Han Sen didn\u2019t seem likely to run off, he didn\u2019t tie Han Sen up. They flew through the clouds in a direction that Han Sen decided to call \u201cup,\u201d and after a while, they saw a group of people in front of them.\n\n\u201cLando!\u201d the people screamed upon seeing Lando.\n\nAnd when they saw Han Sen, they were even more shocked.\n\n\u201cLando, why are you with Han Sen?\u201d the King class leader asked Lando.\n\nLando ignored him and kept flying.\n\nThe King\u2019s face reddened with the snub, but he didn\u2019t complain to Lando.\n\nThe people that were in Lando\u2019s way all backed off. They formed a path for him, with not one person trying to stand in his way. They knew better than that.\n\nBut Han Sen wasn\u2019t so lucky. He tried to follow Lando, but the people circled around him, blocking his way forward. They clearly intended to take Han Sen down together.\n\n\u201cLando, why are you going so fast? Come and deal with these guys. They\u2019re starting to annoy me,\u201d Han Sen said with disdain.\n\nThe people had been preparing to beat Han Sen up, but when they heard him say this, they seemed shocked. They glanced between Han Sen and Lando.\n\nHan Sen had just spoken as if Lando was his subordinate.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get in his way!\u201d Lando commanded without even turning his head.\n\nFor the first time, Han Sen started to realize how much fear Lando inspired in the people of the geno universe. The moment he spoke, all the others backed away from Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen just flew by one hundred Kings. They all just watched him go, not doing anything to him.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do? Why is Han Sen with Lando?\u201d one of the Kings asked their leader with confusion.\n\n\u201cHuh! No matter how strong Lando is, is he stronger than a true deified? With all the people that have come to the Tianxia System, there must be someone who is stronger than Lando. If we release this nugget of news, we might be able to take advantage of the ruckus.\u201d The leader laughed darkly."
