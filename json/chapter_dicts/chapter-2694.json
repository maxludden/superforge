    "text": "Aside from providing him with healing geno fluids, she gave him other kinds of geno fluids as well. They could help with all sorts of things involving his body and his practice. They were fluids synthesized by the Very High themselves. Due to the wealth of resources available in Outer Sky, Han Sen was being given access to resources that few Kings could ever hope to get their hands on.\n\nThe Very High didn\u2019t have a large population. They didn\u2019t have many people devoted to producing healing geno fluids, but they also rarely used healing geno fluids themselves. So, most of the time, the Very High created the geno fluids quite slowly. They kept enough on hand for ordinary use, but as Han Sen stubbornly continued to fight the Red Blood Demon, he had created a situation that the Very High were uniquely unprepared for.\n\nWithin a month, Han Sen had almost cleared out their geno fluid reserves. If he wanted more, he would have to wait for more to be created. That meant one every few days.\n\n\u201cWhy are there no more healing geno fluids?\u201d Han Sen saw the geno fluids Exquisite had brought him, and he noticed they weren\u2019t the same geno fluids he usually used. Rather than the healing fluids that he really needed, these other geno fluids would merely reinforce his genes and physical power.\n\n\u201cEven if there was a whole warehouse full of healing geno fluid, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to support the amount you keep consuming,\u201d Exquisite said. She pointed toward a box with six red geno fluids and went on to say, \u201cThis is a high-class healing geno fluid. They only offer it to deified fighters. Since there are no more of the weaker fluids available, you are being gifted these. Do not go through them willy-nilly. If you use up these, you won\u2019t be granted any more for the next two weeks.\u201d\n\nExquisite didn\u2019t know that Blood Marrow Geno Fluid had the xenogeneic genes of the Red Blood Demon in it. After all, few people knew exactly what was inside a medicine when they took it. The Red Blood Demon\u2019s xenogeneic genes were just one element of these fluids. They weren\u2019t even the primary ingredient.\n\nEven if Exquisite had known the xenogeneic genes were in the fluid, she wouldn\u2019t have known about the potential side effects in this situation. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng knew about this because one of their elders had used a large amount of Blood Marrow Geno Fluid before going into the Jail Demon Hall to kill the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon had instantly gone into a fury.\n\nLuckily, the man had been a larva class deified. Despite the Red Blood Demon\u2019s rage, he had been able to kill it. Only a few people who were close to that elite knew about this. Exquisite and Li Keer didn\u2019t know much about that elite, so they didn\u2019t know how taking the geno fluid would affect the monster inside the hall. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng wouldn\u2019t have come up with this plan if the creature\u2019s reaction to the geno fluid was generally known.\n\nHearing that there was an even better geno fluid that he could use, Han Sen was more than pleased. If he could recover faster, he could spend more time fighting the Red Blood Demon.\n\nAlthough he was unable to beat the Red Blood Demon, he was honing his talents as he fought the creature. That was because the Red Blood Demon had been continuously suppressing him. Han Sen had gained a huge amount of experience by being so determined.\n\n\u201cThis kind of wound really hurts.\u201d Han Sen looked down at his chest and saw his exposed heart, which had come close to being shredded. He had a wry smile.\n\nIf Han Sen had lacked his impressive abilities of recovery, such a strike would have likely killed him.\n\nOpening a Blood Marrow Geno Fluid, Han Sen quickly gulped it all down. He felt a warm sensation race through his body. A numb, itchy feeling passed over his wounds, and Han Sen\u2019s injuries began to heal. He watched in amazement as his wounds sealed closed.\n\n\u201cThis is good stuff. No wonder this is considered a superior item usually reserved for deified elites. The effects are ten times stronger than what I was using before.\u201d Han Sen grinned widely when he saw the wounds heal so quickly.\n\nHis wounds would have taken half a day to heal previously, but now they took less than an hour.\n\nBut the Apollo Set hadn\u2019t recovered yet, so Han Sen had to keep waiting. Without the Apollo Set, his body wouldn\u2019t last.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t waste a single second of his free time, though. He practiced Very Real Body and God\u2019s Wander for a bit. Those two geno arts were very beneficial for him to practice with. They could be used at any time.\n\nWhen the Apollo Set had finally recovered, Han Sen decided it was time to enter Jail Demon Hall again.\n\nBut to Han Sen\u2019s surprise, the Red Blood Demon was sitting on the stairs staring at him when he entered. It didn\u2019t attack him as soon as it saw him.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen wondered. It seemed odd that on this random day, the Red Blood Demon\u2019s temper had improved so much.\n\nWhile Han Sen wondered what it was doing, the Red Blood Demon\u2019s body flashed with a bloody light. Its bug wings opened. The strange horn on its head flashed with a crimson that looked like a sun.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! What is going on with this guy? Why has it suddenly exploded with a scary power like this?\u201d Han Sen was very confused. He had fought the Red Blood Demon for a very long time now, but he had never seen it so enraged. And it had suddenly gained a frightening amount of power.\n\nBefore Han Sen had time to consider his situation, he saw the Red Blood Demon\u2019s evil-looking crimson eyes light up like lightbulbs and turn to stare at him. Han Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He just wanted to teleport away from Jail Demon Hall.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t fight the Red Blood Demon at its normal power level, but now, it was a raging version of itself. For all he knew, this thing could destroy his body in one punch and cripple him, leaving him no chance of teleporting away.\n\nBut the moment Han Sen ripped space open to leave, he saw all of the markings across Jail Demon Hall light up in a single, brilliant flash. The whole of the Jail Demon Hall was covered in a holy light.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen bounced out of space and almost hit the ground. He descended into a nice roll, which was how he managed to maintain his balance.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Why have Jail Demon Hall\u2019s restrictions flared up and sealed the entire structure with me inside?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face changed. He looked around frantically, and he found that wavy beams of light covered every surface of the hall. The whole building was sealed up tight, and there was no getting out now.\n\nHan Sen realized that he was in a scary and dangerous situation. Jail Demon Hall was sealed, and he couldn\u2019t use God\u2019s Wander to leave. He was trapped inside with the beast.\n\nFurthermore, the Red Blood Demon had become far more dangerous than usual. When Han Sen had fought the Red Blood Demon previously, he could only last a few minutes. But now, the Red Blood Demon was in a scary mode.\n\nThinking of this, Han Sen turned his attention back to the Red Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon\u2019s eyes were giving off red light. It looked like a small flashlight\u2014the beam of which landed on Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026 I thought we were friends! I\u2019m just taking a break here, you go and do your stuff\u2026 No need to worry about me\u2026\u201d Han Sen forced a smile at the Red Blood Demon as he spoke.\n\nThe Red Blood Demon actually smiled back at Han Sen. But that smile sent a chill down his spine. The jagged, razor-like teeth that lined its maw were particularly menacing to see. It was like a demon that could destroy and devour anything.\n\nThe next second, the Red Blood Demon let out a strange screech. Its body was like a red shadow, and it was coming straight for Han Sen. Han Sen\u2019s eyesight couldn\u2019t read its movements, either. He saw the flash of a red shadow, but the Red Blood Demon remained where it was. Then, another Red Blood Demon appeared in front of him. Its sharp claws were already digging into his chest."
