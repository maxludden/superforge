    "text": "Bai Wan Jie hadn\u2019t expected that Dragon One and the others would make a serious effort to kill Gold Armor General. But based on what he had just learned, it seemed that Dragon One and Dia Robber really intended to take on Gold Armor General.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, Dragon One and Dia Robber didn\u2019t seem to be joking. I think they\u2019re actually planning to fight Gold Armor General. Should we prepare? Should we steal the kill before they arrive?\u201d Nightmare Knight asked Bai Wan Jie.\n\n\u201cWe need to prepare, but there\u2019s no rush. Just let them go ahead if they want to. Do they really think that this Dollar, who came out of nowhere, can truly help them defeat Gold Armor General? How naive.\u201d Bai Wan Jie laughed and went on to say, \u201cEven if I wanted to take down Gold Armor General, I\u2019m afraid I would have to request Yu Shanxin\u2019s aid, which would be expensive. I would also need to rally every half-deified at my disposal if I was to have any hope of defeating Gold Armor General. Dragon One and Dia Robber are too weak.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Bai Wan Jie laughed and said, \u201cLet\u2019s let them go ahead. When they are beaten, we can resume the fight in their place. It will save us a lot of work. Why don\u2019t we do that? Let\u2019s find out when they are going to attack the beast. Then, we\u2019ll know when we can tune in to watch the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I will make preparations,\u201d Nightmare Knight said as he left.\n\nIn the base of the Dragons and the Destroyed, Dragon One and Dia Robber explained their plan for taking on Gold Armor General to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWith our power, we should be able to restrict the Gold Armor General for two to three seconds. During that time, we need you to use this dagger to stab the Gold Armor General\u2019s eyes. You will not have much time, and you only have one dagger. It is crucial that you get close to him during this window of opportunity and blind both of his eyes. If you fail in this task, all our efforts will have been in vain. Can you do this?\u201d Dragon One asked very seriously, passing a snow-white dagger to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to blind his eyes?\u201d Han Sen accepted the dagger and ran his fingers curiously over it.\n\n\u201cGold Armor General\u2019s body is encased in gold armor,\u201d Dragon One explained. \u201cIts defense is too hard for us to penetrate. Even a top dog half-deified couldn\u2019t pierce that monster\u2019s armor, so it will be difficult to damage. The Gold Armor General\u2019s weakness is its eyes, where it lacks the protection of the gold armor. The eyes are only protected by crystals. Even so, ordinary half-deifieds cannot break them. The only way to break through the crystal that shields the eyes is if a half-deified wields the deified Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger, a Dragon treasure.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Dragon One continued speaking. \u201cAccording to those who hunted Steel Armor General and Silver Armor General, they are deified beings, but their senses aren\u2019t too strong. They depend solely on their eyes. If its vision is destroyed, Gold Armor General won\u2019t be as dangerous as we fear. Plus, once the eyes are destroyed, we can continue attacking the wounds and kill the fiend easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means you have another weapon to kill him?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger.\n\nThe dagger was snow-white. It glistened like jade, and both sides of the dagger were engraved with the shape of an icy dragon. The engraving was beautifully detailed.\n\nWhile Han Sen held the dagger, he felt cold. He could feel the soul of an undying dragon roaring within the weapon.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t one of the universe\u2019s top deified treasures, the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger suited Han Sen. Using it wouldn\u2019t require much strength, as the dagger was sharp enough to tear through space.\n\n\u201cYes, the dagger will only be enough to injure Gold Armor General\u2019s eyes. It isn\u2019t strong enough to kill the creature. We are prepared for that, but your mission is to take out his eyes. You only need to complete this objective. Whether or not we manage to kill Gold Armor General in the end, you will receive your one thousand xenogeneic genes just for blinding the creature,\u201d Dragon One said.\n\n\u201cSure. Let\u2019s do that, then,\u201d Han Sen said while putting away the dagger.\n\n\u201cAhem, Brother Dollar. You can hold onto the dagger for now, but this thing is a treasure of the Dragon. You cannot take it too far away from us,\u201d Dragon One said with a cough.\n\n\u201cUntil I kill the Gold Armor General, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThank you for understanding, Dollar. There is something you must remember, also. You must use this dagger to strike the eyes. Skills like swordlights will not be effective on the eyes of this being,\u201d Dragon One said.\n\n\u201cSure. I will keep that in mind.\u201d Han Sen nodded absently, spinning the dragon tooth dagger around his hands in intricate arcs.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t have to practice when it came to killing creatures. Any weapon could serve the purpose. This time, he was hunting a deified creature, though. It might be weaker than outside deifieds, but he knew that was no excuse to be sloppy. He couldn\u2019t risk recklessness, and so, Han Sen knew he would have to get himself in tip-top shape.\n\nOf course, he wasn\u2019t just doing this for the one thousand King-class xenogeneic genes that were on the line. He wanted to test his mettle and see if he could kill the deified xenogeneic to earn its beast soul.\n\nXenogeneic treasures were great, but for the people who came from the sanctuaries, beast souls were even better.\n\nHan Sen kept his promise and didn\u2019t leave the base. He stayed there and spent each day practicing with the dragon tooth dagger. Dragon One was pleased to see this. No matter how he saw it, Dollar was very respectful of the job he had signed up for.\n\nDragon Three approached Dragon One and joined him in watching Han Sen. They remained silent for a while as Han Sen practiced.\n\n\u201cBrother, do you think this Dollar will succeed? He needs to get close to the Gold Armor General in a short amount of time and blind him. So far, not even an Extreme King half-deified has managed to do something like that. And Dollar is still King class\u2026 Brother, if you need me to, I can ask Yu Shanxin to help out. With him here, our chances of success would be much higher.\u201d\n\nDragon One shook his head. \u201cHiring Yu Shanxin wouldn\u2019t be that easy. Even if the Extreme King sought to hire him, they would have to pay a high price. That sort of cost would be considerable to the Extreme King, and we have far fewer resources.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Dragon One\u2019s eyes drifted over to Han Sen, who was still practicing. His expression became strangely distant, and he said, \u201cDollar might be the next Yu Shanxin. Perhaps even stronger.\u201d\n\nDragon Three looked at Dragon One with shock. He turned back and stared at the practicing man. There was no trace of humor in Dragon One\u2019s tone.\n\nDragon One was comparing Dollar to the great Yu Shanxin, and he was even suggesting that Dollar might be stronger. That was an incredible compliment from someone like Dragon One.\n\nWho was Yu Shanxin? He was the scariest half-deified in the universe, and it was a fact admitted by everyone. Not even the Extreme King had a single half-deified on par with Yu Shanxin.\n\nDragon One himself wasn\u2019t equal to Yu Shanxin. If he could say something like this with certainty, he was also admitting himself to be inferior to Dollar. It was hard to imagine the proud Dragon One making that sort of admission.\n\nSeeing the stunned expression on Dragon Three\u2019s face, Dragon One laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying he might be stronger than Yu Shanxin when he levels up. He isn\u2019t that strong right now. But we cannot hire Yu Shanxin, and so, we must settle for him.\u201d"
