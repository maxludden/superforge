    "text": "The two beautiful women looked like flowers made of jade, and Han Sen couldn\u2019t turn his back on either of them. He wasn\u2019t their enemy, so he couldn\u2019t simply choose which one should die.\n\nBut when he thought about the arrogant, perfectionist, blood-thirsty being they combined to become, he knew that he had to do something. It wasn\u2019t just the other races of the universe that would fall under their wrath\u2014eventually, they would go after humans as well.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and then at Elysian Moon. They looked extremely similar to each other. Their presences, however, were different.\n\nGu Qingcheng was mysterious, but she didn\u2019t distance herself from everyone. Elysian Moon was as cold as ice, and looking at her gave people the feeling that they were being shut out. Han Sen could tell the two apart, though, and he would never mistake one for another.\n\nWhen they both combined and became one, their presence was completely different. The woman they made felt like a fairy. She was a being that didn\u2019t care about anything in the world. That coldness was chilling to see.\n\n\u201cWhich of us do you choose to kill?\u201d Elysian Moon asked when Han Sen remained silent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not killing anyone. To be honest, even if I agreed to kill you, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something I could make myself do.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\n\u201cThen would you prefer to watch us fight each other to death or die of old age?\u201d Elysian Moon asked emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. I think there might be a road out of this mess. It is worth a try, at least,\u201d Han Sen said hesitantly.\n\n\u201cWhat road do you mean?\u201d Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng looked up with interest.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Han Sen said, \u201cThe aging problem is being caused by the flaws in your genes. If you can fix these flaws, then there is no reason for you to fight to your doom.\u201d\n\nGu Qingcheng shook her head. \u201cIf things were that simple, we wouldn\u2019t have been fighting in the first place. My genes are included in Elysian Moon\u2019s spirit stone. And Elysian Moon\u2019s genes contain the sword fairy I created. We both have a part of each other, and because of that, parts of ourselves are missing. We can\u2019t use the genes of other creatures to fix problems that are inherent in our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Han Sen nodded, sighed, and said, \u201cMy method isn\u2019t for you to combine with the genes of another creature. My method can fix your genes as they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? If we could fix our genes, we wouldn\u2019t be stuck in this situation,\u201d Elysian Moon said, tilting her head to the side.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re both missing a part of yourselves, and the parts you\u2019re missing are the parts you gave to each other. That means you aren\u2019t complete. But, you both still contain the missing components of each other. All you need to do is fill in the gaps. I can try to activate both of your gene potentials, which might allow your incomplete genes to repair themselves. I\u2019m not sure if it will work, but it is something we should at least try.\u201d The method Han Sen was proposing would require the power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s area. He would push their self-cogwheels in an attempt to force their genes to evolve.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s area power was little more than a nudge. Whether or not it worked would be determined by the possibilities harbored by the genes that required fixing. Therefore, Han Sen couldn\u2019t promise that he would succeed. It was a chance for them, though. It was something they had to try before they resorted to the more sordid solutions.\n\nIf it worked, they could both live.\n\n\u201cYou can fix the flaws of our genes?\u201d Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon\u2019s beautiful eyes were staring at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise you it will work, but there is no harm in trying,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cTry it, then,\u201d Elysian Moon said immediately.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll test it on you first. Come over here,\u201d Han Sen said, looking at Elysian Moon.\n\n\u201cIs there a risk to this process?\u201d Gu Qingcheng asked.\n\n\u201cThere is no risk. While there is a chance that it won\u2019t succeed, failure shouldn\u2019t result in any harm to your bodies,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nElysian Moon walked over to Han Sen. Her voice was completely level as she said, \u201cA long time ago, you were rather unfond of me, weren\u2019t you? It is good that I\u2019m in danger, is it not? If I am dead, then you can be free.\u201d\n\nElysian Moon was saying this to Gu Qingcheng, not Han Sen.\n\nGu Qingcheng moved her lips, but no words were spoken.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, only good things can happen to you. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t want to try this.\u201d Han Sen understood what the two women wanted. He smiled at Elysian Moon.\n\n\u201cStop talking crap. Let\u2019s get on with it. Even when I was a spirit, I was never afraid of death,\u201d Elysian Moon said, meeting Han Sen\u2019s eyes.\n\nHan Sen smiled, lifted his right hand, and pressed his fingers to Elysian Moon\u2019s forehead. Then, he started to cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He made his self-cogwheel connect with Elysian Moon\u2019s self-cogwheel. Then, he started to spin them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to resist my power. Try to accept it and move with it.\u201d A blood godlight formed on Han Sen\u2019s hands, and the light seeped into and melded with Elysian Moon\u2019s body.\n\nWhen the blood light entered her, Elysian Moon\u2019s self-gene power was activated. The dusty self-cogwheel started to spin a little.\n\nElysian Moon\u2019s self-cogwheel was blue. It had old-fashioned symbols inscribed upon it. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what they meant, but he knew that it was the source of Elysian Moon\u2019s power.\n\nWhen Elysian Moon\u2019s self-cogwheel began to accelerate, the old-fashioned symbols shone brightly. They were like a sun. The light blurred as the self-cogwheels spun.\n\nBlue lights rose from the cogwheel, dyeing Elysian Moon\u2019s flesh and cells a weird shade of blue. The woman looked like a blue crystal statue.\n\nThe color was rather ghostly, and Elysian Moon no longer looked like a person. She was like some sort of phantom, or the crystal statue of a witch. And before long, the crystal started to melt.\n\nNo, rather than melting, it was like dirt was being washed off of the crystal statue, layer by layer. It was like a flower shedding its wilted petals.\n\nGu Qingcheng watched Elysian Moon and Han Sen. Her face was always impassive, but right now, she looked nervous.\n\nThe crystalline Elysian Moon\u2019s blue light began to fade. The blue light dissolved into dust, and Elysian Moon\u2019s body changed as the light peeled away. She was starting to become someone different from who she was before.\n\nHan Sen was so happy. Elysian Moon\u2019s genes were starting to change. That meant his Blood-Pulse Sutra was working. Even if he was unable to fix them entirely, this process was still going to benefit Elysian Moon\u2019s body.\n\nBut Elysian Moon wasn\u2019t like Lando, who was a top half-deified. Rather than leveling her up, Han Sen\u2019s power simply improved her genes. Her talent and powers were increasing.\n\nBuzz!\n\nA strange sound came from Elysian Moon\u2019s body, like a sword was being unsheathed. A scary swordmind blossomed from her, and the ghostly air shifted around her. The weird blue light faded further.\n\nDescribing Elysian Moon was difficult, because she now looked like a ghost woman from hell. Right now, Elysian Moon looked like a cold fairy in the moonlight. She seemed distant, but not in a way that would frighten people."
