After hearing what Elysian Moon said, many angry eyes focused on Han Sen. Countless young men wanted to beat up Han Sen to save those two pretty girls.\n\nOf course, young men who thought that way generally didn\u2019t have the necessary rank to visit the core area. The Kings that were watching from inside the core area didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cIs what you said true?\u201d Autumn Wind asked with excitement, his eyes looking bright.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then why are you asking me?\u201d Elysian Moon smiled.\n\n\u201cI believe you, my Lady.\u201d Autumn Wind nodded, then he turned to Han Sen. \u201cCan you please fight me? Don\u2019t worry; I will only beat you on behalf of the lady\u2019s request. I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy is pretty confident,\u201d Han Sen thought, suppressing a laugh. He looked at Autumn Wind and said, \u201cI can fight you. If you win, you see the girls. If I win, what do I earn?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Autumn Wind said, nodding his agreement. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected Autumn Wind to say something like that. He looked at Autumn Wind, thinking he was a funny guy.\n\nHan Sen went silent and said, \u201cIf you lose, why don\u2019t you pull the rickshaw just like he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Autumn Wind didn\u2019t even think about it before he agreed. He probably never expected that he might actually lose.\n\nHan Sen stood up and climbed off the carriage. He stood ten meters away from Autumn Wind.\n\nAutumn Wind looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cUse whatever attack you want. If you can hurt me, you win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThi guy is saying crazier things than I usually do\u2026\u201d Han Sen thought, looking at the man. Autumn Wind had a bow on his back, and seeing it prompted Han Sen to say, \u201cLoan me your bow. I will shoot at you a few times. If you can\u2019t dodge my arrows, then you lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSh*t, this guy is obscene! He must know Autumn Wind\u2019s bow is the Aichi\u2019s deified treasure Wind String. He wants to scam the treasure off of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would dare do such a thing? Does he think Autumn Wind is stupid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot many people would happily hand over a deified treasure to someone else. Even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t hand it to an enemy.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhile everyone complained, Autumn Wind took the bow and quiver off his back. He threw them to Han Sen. The Kings around them stared blankly at the two.\n\n\u201cHe really did loan it to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSh*t! Han Sen just scored big. Run!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he really going to shoot the bow? Autumn Wind just handed it to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead. Shoot me any way you want until you are satisfied.\u201d Autumn Wind appeared lackadaisical, and he spoke to Han Sen in a very casual manner.\n\nHan Sen picked up the bow and quiver. He noticed that the quiver contained ten arrows. He spoke to Autumn Wind and said, \u201cThere are ten arrows. I will shoot at you ten times. If I miss them all, then I lose.\u201d\n\nAutumn Wind nodded and said, \u201cSure. If you can get one arrow to touch my body, then I lose.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything more. He just gripped Autumn Wind\u2019s bow tightly.\n\nThe bow looked very ordinary. Its body appeared to have been constructed from old vines. It looked like a very old-fashioned longbow. The string was a half-transparent, and it was as thin as a hair. It was very tightly strung, though. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what kind of creature\u2019s tendon it came from.\n\nThe moment Han Sen grabbed the bow, Autumn Wind\u2019s face looked glum. That was because when Han Sen picked up the bow, Autumn Wing could tell that he was proficient with the weapon. Han Sen was doubtless an excellent archer.\n\nHowever, Autumn Wind hadn\u2019t given Han Sen his bow because he was stupid.\n\nIn fact, Autumn Wind was very smart. There weren\u2019t many that could make use of Wind String. It was one of the Aichi\u2019s secret treasures, and only the blood of the Aichi could activate it.\n\nThe Wind String was a very spiritual item, and Autumn Wind had already earned its approval. Even if someone took it away from him, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. Han Sen\u2019s attempts to shoot the bow would be pointless. The weapon wouldn\u2019t help him, and he might even end up getting hurt by it.\n\nAutumn Wind being so polite simply because he wanted the two women to have a good impression of his character. If Han Sen used Wind String to shoot him, he wouldn\u2019t even have to move. Han Sen would miss and end up getting hurt by Wind String himself.\n\nWhen he saw how comfortable Han Sen seemed to be when he handled the bow, Autumn Wind realized that Han Sen must be very good at archery. An elite like that shouldn\u2019t have been clueless about Wind String, though. So, it begged the question why Han Sen would request to borrow it.\n\nHan Sen stroked the Wind String\u2019s body. Then, he slipped two fingers around the string and tried to pull it.\n\nAs everyone observed, that silk-like, half-transparent string didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cPfff!\u201d The Kings and nobles who saw this almost spat out whatever was in their mouths.\n\nAfter half a day, Han Sen was unable to move the bow\u2019s string. There was no need for the competition. Han Sen couldn\u2019t even fire a single arrow.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is too naive. Did he really think Autumn Wind was letting him the bow out of the goodness of his heart? This is the Aichi\u2019s Wind String. Without the blood of an Aichi, it cannot be used.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. How could I forget that? That is Wind String. When the Aichi were going through their roughest period of history, their final deified passed away. They haven\u2019t had a deified since that time. The race of the Bonas attacked the Aichi and stole Wind String from them. Then, the Bona\u2019s king tried to show off Wind String at a party. It was given to a general who was a master with the bow. He took the bow, and the king asked him for an archery performance. But that general, despite trying all sorts of different powers, couldn\u2019t get the bow\u2019s string to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe king of the Bonas saw this, and he commanded another general to work with the first general. One of them held the bow while the other pulled back the string. They tried to force Wind String open. They did manage to draw Wind String, but after they drew it, the string came to life like a thunderstorm. Wind String started to move by itself, and somehow, the string cut the heads off both of the generals. Ever since then, no one who owned Wind String was able to wield it. They all ended up getting hurt by it. It was even said to bring bad luck. That was until Wind String was brought back to its rightful place. The Aichi elite who retrieved it killed many people with Wind String and eventually became deified. It brought the Aichi race back to life and relevance. As a result, Wind String\u2019s name became very famous across the universe. But aside from the Aichi, no others dare to use the bow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder Autumn Wind was so quick to give the bow away. It really is the Wind String.\u201d"
