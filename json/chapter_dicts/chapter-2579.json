The Six Core God Snake had beat him up earlier, and so he gnashed his teeth now in rage. His body unleashed a black light, and even more heavy substance chains thudded into the Six Core God Snake. The Six Core God Snake\u2019s movements slowed to a crawl. There was no way that it could escape the planet now.\n\nTwo of its cogwheels were destroyed now, and it was heavily injured. It moved with snail-like speed. The small Crocodile God\u2019s gravity substance chains were pinning it in place, keeping it from avoiding Han Sen\u2019s attacks.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang! Pang!\n\nThe gold general flew over to the Six Core God Snake that was pinned to the planet. Instead of pulling out the pillar that was pinning the snake, he used his fists to strike the creature. Gold energy carried each swing. It was like a glowing storm was raining down on the captured snake.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake remained pinned in place. The small Crocodile God\u2019s substance chains had it trapped, and there was nothing it could do to defend itself. Under the gold general\u2019s continuing barrage of attacks, the cogwheels broke one after another. In seconds, another two had crumbled to dust.\n\nAs this went on, the Six Core God Snake was suffering horrendously. It cast countless space substance chains. They rose like an infinity of venomous snakes and tried to wrap themselves around the gold general.\n\nHan Sen was running his gold general at max capacity. Still, he couldn\u2019t free his fist from the substance chains. He was trapped and could no longer move.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Six Core God Snake\u2019s tail slammed into him, sending the gold general flying again. Its anger fueled that scary attack, caving in the gold general\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cThe Six Core God Snake is so powerful! It is gravely injured, and yet, it can still fight. No wonder it is considered one of the best in the core area.\u201d The gold general tore a trench across a long section of the planet\u2019s surface before Han Sen could regain control of the machine.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake\u2019s tail coiled around the Sky God Pillar and pulled the pillar out of its body. It wanted to move, but the small Crocodile God appeared in front of it. The little creature struck one of the two cogwheels the snake had remaining.\n\nThere was a snapping noise. The small Crocodile God managed to destroy the cogwheel, and it was a painful blow for the Six Core God Snake. The agony made the snake\u2019s long body shiver and shake, and it tried to swing its tail toward the small Crocodile God instead.\n\nPang!\n\nThe small Crocodile God flew away like a ball, and the Sky God Pillar drifted away as well.\n\nHan Sen drove the gold general to reclaim the Sky God Pillar. With his weapon in-hand, he thrust his arm toward the Six Core God Snake. While the snake was still contorted in pain, Han Sen penetrated the creature\u2019s final cogwheel.\n\nThe Six Core God Snake thrashed and twisted. It tried using its tail to smack the gold general away again, but the small Crocodile God was furiously returning to the fray. A heavy substance chain landed across the snake and slowed it even further.\n\nThe gold general approached as this occurred. Han Sen\u2019s fists angrily pummeled the wounds of the Six Core God Snake. A frenzy of gold punches hit the snake like a crazy and wrathful storm. The Six Core God Snake\u2019s body was slowly driven into the planet. Chunks of rock flew everywhere.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen continued to punch, and the Six Core God Snake and the planet exploded. The scary explosion spread through space like a beautiful firework.\n\n\u201cCore deified xenogeneic hunted: Six Core God Snake. Deified xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Six Core God Snake beast soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the beast soul!\u201d Han Sen grinned.\n\nFar away in space, Exquisite and Li Keer were frozen. They had used their Very High Sense to watch the entire battle unfold. They thought Han Sen was quite amazing when he turned into the gold general, but then he cooperated with the small Crocodile God to defeat the Six Core God Snake with relative ease.\n\n\u201cIt really was Dollar that stole the Sea Sky Eye and the Sky God Pillar.\u201d Li Keer\u2019s heart was a confused mess of emotion at that moment. She had thought from the beginning that the Gold Armor General had some connection to Dollar, but she hadn\u2019t suspected that Dollar himself could have been that gold general.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Exquisite\u2019s normally emotionless face looked shocked. She recognized the gold general, but she didn\u2019t understand how Dollar was able to become the foe he had once defeated.\n\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d Li Keer shook her head with a wry smile. She knew that was the gold general, but she didn\u2019t know how Dollar could transform into it. She could not imagine what forces could allow that.\n\nThe small Crocodile God ran to the Six Core God Snake\u2019s corpse. It kicked and bit it savagely. It was a shame that the little creature didn\u2019t eat meat. And the Six Core God Snake\u2019s body was like metal, anyway. There was probably nothing worth eating there regardless.\n\nHan Sen put away the gold general that had been badly damaged. The Six Core God Snake was strong. Even the gold general\u2019s powerful defensives had taken a lot of nasty damage. Some parts of it were broken entirely. If the small Crocodile God hadn\u2019t used his gravity substance chains to restrict the snake, the gold general would have been cut to pieces.\n\nDigging out the Six Core God Snake\u2019s core xenogeneic gene, Han Sen noted how it was a jade green cogwheel. It was only around the size of a fist, and it had spun continuously in the Six Core God Snake\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cThat is some good stuff.\u201d Han Sen could feel the scary presence emitted by the cogwheel, and so he complimented it. But he still couldn\u2019t absorb deified genes just yet, so he put it away for now.\n\nThe small Crocodile God spent the last of his anger on the corpse of the snake. He flew to Han Sen and began to make noises that were a mixture of screams and crying. It was like the little guy claiming that Han Sen had lied to him.\n\n\u201cSmall Crocodile God, you are so powerful! You killed such a powerful xenogeneic! You must be the strongest creature in the universe\u2026\u201d Han Sen looked at the small Crocodile God with admiration and complimented it profusely.\n\nThe small Crocodile God was about to continue ranting at Han Sen, but as he heard all this, he became cocky. He squinted his little eyes and looked very proud. He looked as if he was strong and almighty and forgot about his argument with Han Sen.\n\n\u201cKids are easy to trick,\u201d Han Sen thought, looking at the prideful little Crocodile God with a smile.\n\nThe small Crocodile God leaped back onto Han Sen\u2019s head. It raised its head and roared. It seemed to be telling Han Sen to go and find more xenogeneics for it to kill.\n\nHan Sen flew away. And as he went, he examined the core deified beast soul he had obtained from the Six Core God Snake.\n\nCore deified beast soul Six Core God Snake: Weapon\n\n\u201cA weapon beast soul? It\u2019s a weapon beast soul! It is finally here. I wonder what it will be? Since it came from a snake, perhaps it will be a spear. Maybe it will be a sword. Or maybe it will end up being a dagger?\u201d Han Sen was so happy. He had wanted a deified weapon for the longest time. And this was a space power weapon beast soul, so it had to be something special.\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen summoned the Six Core God Snake beast soul.\n\nA green compound bow appeared in his hands. The bow looked so cool. It had mechanical arms, and its body was decorated with six wheels. It had the features of a mechanical cold-based weapon. It was chilly to the touch, and it looked frightening. He could already tell that it would have unparalleled accuracy.\n\nThe cold-based weapon exuded a murderous feeling. Something about its styling reminded Han Sen of a complex machine. Han Sen could see the bow shimmer with the shadow of the Six Core God Snake.\n\n\u201cThis is a bow?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Six Core Snake Bow in his hands in surprise."
