When Demon Emperor entered the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, not a single sanctuary had been discovered by humans yet.\n\nWhen he was about to enter the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, his equipment became useless, so he gave all of it to his subordinates.\n\nDragon King received his armor, and when he tried to ascend to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, it saved him from certain death. His ascension failed, but he was not killed outright as was expected.\n\nTherefore, Dragon King made preparations for a future sacrificial ritual that would allow him to one day be reborn in full.\n\nThe Dragon Ring was his last resort, but neither method had worked out well for him.\n\nFurthermore, the armor was damaged. But regardless, Dragon King hid it someplace special, so he could recover it upon his return to the world.\n\nHan Sen put the ring on and hid it with his dongxuan aura. He summoned Moment Queen so he could ask for more information regarding Demon Emperor.\n\nMoment Queen scoffed and wished to ignore Han Sen completely, but she knew that wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere. So, to gain his favor, she told him what she could.\n\nWhen she first reached the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, Demon Emperor had already been in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary for ten thousand years. What she heard were only whispers, murmurs, and rumors regarding the figure. And she never even knew Dragon King was associated with him. What she had heard about most was the simple power Demon Emperor possessed. She had no idea about what he owned or anything.\n\nHan Sen put Moment Queen away again. Then, he touched the ring and asked, \u201cDragon King, do you know someone named Yaksha?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is another subordinate that belongs to Demon Emperor. We were never friendly, and he was always jealous of the armor I was given. Still, he never could beat me,\u201d Dragon King told Han Sen without fuss.\n\n\u201cDid you know that he went to your sacrificial ritual?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThat *sshole must have come for my armor. Little did he know that it was not with me. I foresaw the possibility of something like this occurring, and so I set up a trap. If he sprang it, he should be heavily wounded now,\u201d Dragon King explained.\n\nHan Sen did not move and asked, \u201cYou said you were given the armor. What was Yaksha given?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was given a Demon Seed by Demon Emperor. It takes one-hundred-thousand years to grow. The tree that grows, upon maturity, can bear many fruit that provide spirit genes. If low-tier spirits consume one, they can outright open gene locks. But like I said, it takes one-hundred-thousand years for such a tree to grow,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Yaksha wanted to kill me, if it took that long.\u201d Now Han Sen was understanding Yaksha\u2019s motives a whole lot more.\n\nDragon King also said that if a king spirit ate one, it could increase a few self geno points. But whenever Han Sen ate one, it only provided him a single point. It seemed as if things were far more difficult for a super king spirit.\n\n\u201cI need to find a way to move that tree. Maybe I really can get it to grow some more fruit,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen kept Dragon King in the ring. He planned to leave him there for a while, as he wasn\u2019t going to get the spirit\u2019s armor just yet.\n\nEven if the location he spoke of was true, the armor resided deep within the forest. And venturing there could prove too much, even for him. It was likely he\u2019d encounter a variety of super creatures if he was to go there.\n\nEven if he used the underground shelter, there was no guarantee it would work. And Han Sen was now responsible for the lives of everyone else who lived in the shelter, meaning he could not take so many risks. If a super creature attacked the shelter, it was likely they\u2019d all be killed.\n\nHan Sen looked at his self geno points and noticed he had a hundred and sixty-three. Forty-five of those had come from Dragon King.\n\nHan Sen recalled he had to battle Split-Space King, so he decided to return to the spirit base.\n\n\u201cI hope he was patient enough to wait all this time,\u201d Han Sen said to himself, as he drove the island to where he had proposed that the fight be held.\n\nAll the spirits were still gathered at Shen Xiao, waiting for the much-anticipated fight to commence.\n\nSplit-Space King had waited there for three days, and when the shadow-spirit never appeared, they believed it was due to cowardice.\n\nUnfortunately, Han Sen\u2019s absence only fueled Split-Space King\u2019s arrogance.\n\n\u201cI expected more from the spirit that beckoned me to fight.\u201d Split-Space King feigned disappointment, but the mocking of his tone was hard to miss.\n\n\u201cYou really want to have a self-fight with me?\u201d A voice came from an incoming island, with a handsome spirit atop it.\n\n\u201cThe King\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the nameless king spirit actually The King?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would appear so.\u201d\n\n\u201cNiiice!\u201d\n\n\u201cSplit-Space King said The King is garbage. I guess now we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen many spirits recognized Han Sen, they began to talk amongst themselves with great fervor.\n\n\u201cYou are the king spirit that wished to fight me?\u201d Split-Space King asked.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cAnd you are The King?\u201d Split-Space King asked.\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, that saves me some trouble. Let me kill you so we can get this over with,\u201d Split-Space King said.\n\nHan Sen started the self-fight. Due to Split-Space King being first rank in the entire spirit base, he was able to send him an invitation immediately.\n\nSplit-Space King promptly agreed, which led to his statue going bright.\n\n\u201cSelf-fight? It really is a self-fight!\u201d\n\nAll the spirits began screaming with excitement, as the hype consumed them. Only the greatest of enemies would commit to a self-fight, so it was rare to witness such a battle."
