    "text": "The stones were dark like ink, but they were also dull. The stones absorbed any light that shone against them, giving nothing back.\n\nThe Duke class elites were wearily lifting their shovels to strike the stone. Sparks flew with each hit, and bits of the stone crumbled away and split.\n\nThe Dukes and Marquises were like slaves, while the Barons and Viscounts were relegated to transportation duties.\n\nThe stones they collected were sent to a stone factory, where all sorts of stone weaponry were forged.\n\nA man stood over them, his expression hard. He used a pen to draw carefully across the stone, marking dimensions as if he was planning how the rock should be carved into.\n\nThe noble workers that were in charge of carving and grinding looked at the man with great envy.\n\nThe nobles were like hell\u2019s guard dogs. The Hell race ruled, and all other races existed as thralls. Even the Kings of other races were treated as mere slaves.\n\nThere was a crystallizer man who was a Marquise, and he looked very weak. Over the past few months, he had been used by the Hell. He was skilled enough that he didn\u2019t have to perform the menial tasks of labor. He was able to enjoy many resources, as he was a person that the Hell looked at very differently.\n\n\u201cNing Yue, you have done well. What should we do next to increase efficiency?\u201d Hell King squinted his eyes, looking at the young man approaching the palace.\n\nThe crystallizer had captured his curiosity. The man was an outsider Marquise, but many Hell nobles had praised him over the past few months. That was a big deal. Not even Kings received that treatment.\n\nHell King planned to ask the man\u2019s advice to humor his own curiosity, then toss the man back in with the slaves. After all, everyone knew that only the Hell were important. Other races were designed to be slaves and nothing more.\n\nAs time went by, Ning Yue gave suggestions to the king every once in a while, and all of his suggestions had increased the efficiency of their work. It saved the Hell King a lot of time and trouble.\n\nEvery time Hell King wished to send Ning Yue back to the other slaves, Ning Yue would come up with an even better plan. When Hell King heard his designs, he would allow Ning Yue to stay even longer and put those new designs into action.\n\nAfter a while, Hell King wasn\u2019t the only one who had grown used to the presence of Ning Yue. The whole Hell society had become accustomed to him.\n\n\u201cBlood! Blood! There is blood!\u201d Screaming sounds howled out of the stone factory.\n\nNing Yue frowned and looked in their direction. A big rock had been cracked open, and a red liquid was oozing out of the gap. It smelled like blood.\n\nThe slaves were running for their lives, and Ning Yue stared at the big black rock.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened. In Ning Yue\u2019s first few months there, this had taken place three times.\n\nThe first time they found a black rock that bled, there was a red bug inside it. The monster had ended up killing a few thousand slaves and guards. In the end, Hell King himself had to show up and kill it. It was the only way to get rid of the bug.\n\nThe second time this occurred\u2014when a black rock started to bleed\u2014the slaves of that area became infected with some sort of toxin. They endured it for ten days before their bodies dissolved into liquid. At least ten thousand died in that incident.\n\nThe third time they discovered a bleeding black rock, a little green sword came out. It pierced through the head of the Duke who had been inspecting the stone. Then it flew into the sky and disappeared.\n\nThis was now the fourth incident that Ning Yue had seen. Red liquid welled in the cracks, and it was like blood tears were rolling out, one-by-one.\n\nSuddenly, Ning Yue saw a finger appear through the gap. The finger glistened like jade. It was beautiful, but the fingernail shone a disturbing shade of red. Even looking at the unsettling sight would leave someone shivering.\n\nOne finger\u2026 two fingers\u2026 three fingers\u2026 More and more fingers appeared through the crack. When all ten fingers appeared, there was a loud cracking noise. The fingers tore the rock in half.\n\nA woman wearing creepy red armor emerged. Her red eyes gleamed, staring down at the creatures that were all running away in fear.\n\nSuddenly, the woman moved. She was like a demon, straight from hell. She turned into a bloody shadow, and wherever her blood-red fingers went, creatures screamed. Blood fountained from their bodies, and in no time at all, many creatures had been reduced to shreds.\n\nThe terrifying woman showed no sign of backing down. Hell King and the other Kings of their race went to meet that wicked force, and the entire land turned into a bloody battlefield. The hell-looking xenogeneic space was thrown into turmoil.\n\nBlood\u2026 blood everywhere\u2026\n\nThere was the blood of slaves. The blood of the Hell. Broken bodies littered the ground, and almost no one was left alive in that xenogeneic space.\n\nTwo of them were still standing, though, their lifeforces flickering in the hellscape.\n\nOne of them was the weird woman in her red armor. The other was Hell King.\n\nThe strange woman didn\u2019t look to be in good condition. Her red eyes shone with a scary light. Her red armor was covered in cracks and punctures, and a piece of a sword blade was still embedded in it. There was a big bloody hole in her chest. It was impossible to guess which weapon had dealt that blow to her. She was bleeding, and she could barely stand.\n\nHell King wasn\u2019t in great shape, either. One of his horns had been broken, and one of his legs was gone. His belly had been cut open, and his guts and intestines were starting to spill out.\n\nHell King\u2019s face looked enraged; all the inhabitants of that xenogeneic space had been murdered by the strange woman. Aside from him, no one else had been left alive.\n\n\u201cI will make you die.\u201d Hell King opened his mouth and spat out a mass of blood. The blood drained away across the ground, revealing a small green sword.\n\nIf Ning Yue had seen it, he would have recognized it. It was the sword that had flown away when they opened that third black rock.\n\nThe woman saw the green sword, and her eyes lost their anger. She looked scared.\n\nHell King roared. He picked up the green sword and ran at the weird woman. The green sword was aimed at her head.\n\nThe woman blocked the little green sword with one hand and shoved her other hand into Hell King\u2019s chest to grab his heart. The green sword broke under the force of her grip, and her fist tightened around Hell King\u2019s heart.\n\nDong!\n\nThe little green sword fell to the ground, and the light in Hell King\u2019s eyes started to fade. Just as the fire of his life was about to be extinguished, Hell King roused himself. He would rather burn out the last of his strength than slowly wither away. He quickly grabbed the weird woman\u2019s neck."
