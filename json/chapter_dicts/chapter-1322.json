And as he watched him intently, the young man turned around and smiled. This gave him a shock.\n\n\u201cHe knows we are here?\u201d the three-eyed spirit gasped in surprise.\n\nGu Demon Emperor said, \u201cNever; that should be impossible. We\u2019re so very far away, and on top of that, we\u2019ve hidden our lifeforces.\u201d\n\nThe three-eyed spirit was still unnerved by the smile he had received, though. He said, \u201cWell, if he\u2019s as tough as No God Emperor has been saying, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he knew we were here. If anything, it gives credence to his claims. If that\u2019s true, we might have a greater problem on our hands than we initially assumed.\u201d\n\nThe three-eyed spirit paused for a moment, then went on to say, \u201cPah, and here I thought we were the problem on their hands. But Godslayer Luo was so strong, and we still forced him to ascend to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. With the combined might and power of ourselves and the emperors still to come, there is no hope for the heir or the young man to escape death.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Ruin Emperor here yet?\u201d Gu Demon Emperor asked.\n\nThe three-eyed spirit answered, \u201cHe set off two days ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the fate of this lot is sealed. Each and every one of those people will be brutally murdered when Ruin Emperor arrives.\u201d Gu Demon was speaking with a bitter contempt for Han Sen and everyone with him.\n\nMany other spirits were slowly starting to arrive at the shelter now, all doing so in the belief they were hidden from the awareness of the shelter\u2019s occupants.\n\n\u201cIs that a spirit fighting Giant God Emperor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you telling me you don\u2019t know who Xie Qing King is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Is he supposed to be famous?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was, one hundred thousand years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little before my time, but why would he be helping Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir and the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He always was a bit of an oddball.\u201d\n\nA colorful ship was on its way, sailing across the broad reaches of the nearby sea to its ultimate destination. Two ladies were engaged in chit-chat, and their names were Flower Empress and Heavenly Empress.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the shipmasters, however. The captain was currently helming the vessel.\n\nAnother emperor was on its way to the shelter, soaring not too far above that same blue. This spirit was riding atop a dragon, and as it went, an abundance of frightening sea creatures followed in its wake.\n\nAll these creatures arrived near the shelter and remained in hiding.\n\nNothing was escaping Han Sen\u2019s notice, though. He knew every single thing that was coming to his shelter, and despite that, he was not afraid.\n\nSnowball appeared to have just as much knowledge as Han Sen did, but its reaction was slightly different. Shivering in fear, it was cowering behind Bao\u2019er\u2019s back. Although the creature resembled a dog, it was a scaredy-cat, more than anything. It was allergic to the mere concept of danger.\n\nPerhaps it was a glutton for punishment, but being with Bao\u2019er made it feel a touch safer. Despite her frequent bullying, there was something about her presence that made it feel better.\n\nBaby Ghost was not looking too good, either. He had only opened seven gene locks, so his strength was still far below all his peers. There\u2019d be no hope of him competing with any of the spirits or creatures that had come, mouths drooling with a bloodlust.\n\n\u201cHow can this nincompoop acquire so many enemies?! We\u2019re doomed! Yes, we\u2019re doomed!\u201d Baby Ghost was not fond of the idea of staying there to fight it out, as he thought there was no chance of victory. His mind feverishly searched for a way in which he might escape his current predicament and live to see another day.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s life was in Han Sen\u2019s hands, as it had been for a long time. But now, it was teetering near the space between his fingers. This was a decisive moment for them all, with repercussions that could shape the future of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. She had to fight, despite the slim chances of survival. And while she had had her fair share of ups and downs with Han Sen, she was going to do all she could to see him through.\n\nShe knew of the enemies that were closing in, but she also knew that was not the brunt of it. The worst had yet to come.\n\nAnd this was a thought that planted a seed of unsettling emotions in her mind. Despite her determination to try, she and the others successfully defending the shelter and emerging victorious was not something she could see happening.\n\nEven though Zero had an infinite vat of power, and she\u2019d undoubtedly bring down more than a grand count of spirits and creatures during the fight, she was not invincible. Her body was still that of a frail young girl. It was a numbers game now, and the odds were stacked against them tenfold.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, she wasn\u2019t even there. Ever since Han Sen took her back to the Alliance, she had yet to show up again.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t keep his best weapon locked up. What is he planning to do? This is Han Sen, after all. He always has a trick up his sleeve,\u201d Moment Queen said to herself, pondering the events to come.\n\nHan Sen knew the spirits had all come for one target in particular, and that was Godslayer Luo\u2019s heir. If they did not see Zero there, he believed, they would not begin an all-out assault.\n\nIf they did proceed forward with an attack, despite her absence, then Han Sen would give Zero a call so she could come and catch them all off-guard.\n\nBoom!\n\nGiant God Emperor began to stumble and fall, as a sharp silver light plunged deep into his chest.\n\nGiant God Emperor had been killed, and with Xie Qing King\u2019s typical cockiness, he stepped forward to ask, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe! I hope you\u2019re ready to meet your maker.\u201d A spirit answered the call, pointing a wheel at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHe kind of looks like The King,\u201d Flower Empress said.\n\n\u201cMaybe, but that\u2019s not him,\u201d Heavenly Empress said.\n\n\u201cHeavenly, where is Godslayer\u2019s heir?\u201d A female voice sounded, from someone else on the ship.\n\nHeavenly Empress turned and gave a bow. She said, \u201cI scanned the entire shelter, but as far as I can tell, she is not yet present. She must be in the Alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we wait,\u201d the empress said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Heavenly Empress said, returning her gaze to the battleground.\n\nXie Qing King had taken down five emperors himself by this point, but tiredness was starting to catch up with him. He finally needed a breather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to show off, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Han Sen said, stepping forward to provide Xie Qing King with a rest.\n\n\u201cOkay, bossman. Have fun up there.\u201d Xie Qing King went to sit down next to Bao\u2019er.\n\nHe was sweating profusely, knowing he exhausted too much power in those few fights.\n\n\u201cWho wants to fight me, then?\u201d Han Sen had learned to say it with the intimidating confidence Xie Qing King would use. He knew it would be best to thin the herd one-by-one now rather than later.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a small human. Let me come over there and swat you like the bug that you are!\u201d Four spirits leaped out from the sidelines, wanting to squash the pompous human underfoot.\n\nHan Sen did not know why Xie Qing King could fight them one-by-one, while he couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because they know I\u2019m too hot for them to handle solo,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nThat was incorrect, though. Han Sen didn\u2019t fight alone when he took on other shelters. He always attacked with the silver fox and Purple Emperor by his side. Without them there, they thought he\u2019d be an easy target. Hence why so many emperor spirits were so eager to take him on at once.\n\nThe four spirits themselves were surprised they had all jumped forward to fight in tandem. It wasn\u2019t as if they had planned that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Han Sen said."
