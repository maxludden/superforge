    "text": "When Lando saw the deified Demon approaching, he tensed.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand, I mean no harm! I would just like a chat with Teacher Han,\u201d the deified Demon shouted, lifting his hands.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Han Sen looked at the deified Demon with confusion.\n\n\u201cMy name is Moldo,\u201d the deified Demon said politely. \u201cI\u2019m one of the alpha\u2019s guards. I\u2019m out looking for Teacher Han. I would like to invite you to come to the Demon as a guest.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised. Moldo was a deified being, and yet he was being so polite, as if they were the same level. The man\u2019s voice certainly carried the weight of respect. There was no indication that a deified being was speaking to a mere King.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Han. We Demons mean no harm. If you are willing to visit us, we can guarantee your safety. No one will bother you,\u201d Moldo said. His manner of politeness had yet to change.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you and your people?\u201d Han Sen asked Moldo, even though he knew where this was going to go.\n\nMoldo, still being as courteous as possible, said, \u201cOur leader would like it if Teacher Han was willing to bless him. If you are willing to do this, our entire society would greatly appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive a blessing?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. Then, he realized what Moldo actually meant. Han Sen narrowed his eyes in thought. \u201cAre you not afraid that the Extreme King will come after you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to lie,\u201d Moldo said seriously. \u201cWe cannot fight the might of the Extreme King, but we have a way that you can travel to us without attracting the attention of the Extreme King. Even if the Extreme King come looking, they won\u2019t be able to find you. They cannot threaten your safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. But I\u2019m afraid that each blessing costs an incredible amount of power. I cannot perform another blessing in such a short timeframe. I doubt I would be able to help your leader by blessing him,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nUsing the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel cost a lot of energy, but Han Sen was making it sound worse than it was. He just didn\u2019t want to decline Moldo directly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Moldo told him. \u201cA blessing can\u2019t be rushed. If you don\u2019t mind, I am willing to provide you with protection. I won\u2019t allow anything to pull you into the clutches of the Extreme King.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, but I have other things to do right now. I can\u2019t bother you to accompany me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIf Han Sen went to see the Demon, he would owe them. They might end up being less polite than they were acting right now.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will not force you. But if you need anything, feel free to call us anytime. The Demon door will always be open for you.\u201d Moldo then waved to Han Sen and left.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t expected Moldo to leave just like that, but he suspected it might have something to do with Lando\u2019s presence. If Lando hadn\u2019t been there, Moldo would have likely just kidnapped him and taken him back to the Demons by force.\n\nHan Sen and Lando kept going. They encountered a few more Kings and half-deifieds along the way. They were even more polite to Han Sen. Some people were like Moldo, inviting Han Sen to return to their homeworlds with them, but none dared to do anything ill to him. Lando\u2019s presence was great at deterring that sort of rudeness.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows you are Teacher Han,\u201d Lando said flatly. \u201cYour life will be much easier now.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled. \u201cA genius like me should be called a teacher.\u201d\n\nLando ignored him. He wasn\u2019t interested in Han Sen\u2019s self-aggrandizement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so boring. At a time like this, you and I should be chatting,\u201d Han Sen said to Lando.\n\n\u201cYou want me to compliment you?\u201d Lando asked emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cYou should say things like, \u2018Han Sen, you\u2019re the greatest genius in a thousand years!'\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Lando nodded and said nothing else. He wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nThe Tianxia Unicorn was native to the Tianxia System. It took them back to the blue clouds without difficulty, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t find the white whale anywhere. He began scouring the area.\n\n\u201cWhere are Bao\u2019er and the others?\u201d Han Sen was worried. He was afraid an accident might have happened.\n\nBut with the power of the white whale and the little red bird, even if a deified being came after them, they should have been able to escape.\n\nAt this time, the white whale had come to a stop in a sea of green clouds. A flaming red phoenix had emerged from the white whale to do battle with a deified of the Extreme King. It was Bao Qin. The two were fighting like crazy, and fire roared everywhere. Harp acoustics broke the sky.\n\nInstead of chasing after Han Sen, Bao Qin had come looking for Fang Qing Yu. Upon finding him, he also discovered the white whale. The white whale had a high level of defense, but it was unable to repel sonic powers.\n\nBao Qin used the harp to attack, and he tried to enter the white whale to beat up Fang Qing Yu and all the pirates.\n\nThe little red bird had to become a red phoenix to fight Bao Qin. The fight was so bad that it was destroying the cloudscape around them.\n\nBao Qin had brought other Kings and deifieds from the Extreme King, and they now surrounded the white whale. Luckily, the white whale had a high level of defense, and its weapon systems were good, too.\n\nIn the beginning, the Kings and half-deifieds weren\u2019t making much headway against the white whale. They couldn\u2019t penetrate its defenses.\n\nBut one of the half-deified beings could travel through solid material. He slid through the white whale\u2019s shell into its interior. He quickly realized that the white whale was actually a ship.\n\nBao\u2019er was happily piloting the white whale, merrily fighting off the Kings and half-deifieds. Ning Yue was underneath a table with his hands on his head. His a*s was sticking out, and he was mumbling, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me\u2026 don\u2019t kill me\u2026\u201d\n\nFang Qing Yue and the pirates were unable to help in a time like this. They hid behind Bao\u2019er and kept shouting,\n\n\u201cCaptain Bao\u2019er is so awesome!\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Captain is the strongest in the universe. Kill those motherf*ckers!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare they attack our beautiful little Captain Bao\u2019er. You are already dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Captain, you can do it\u2026 you can do it!\u201d\n\nThey continued to shout insults at the attackers, their faces red. And amidst all the noise, an Extreme King man suddenly entered the white whale. He traveled through all the walls and went straight for the command deck.\n\n\u201cFang Qing Yu, you are here!\u201d When Kiek saw Fang Qing Yu, he didn\u2019t stop. He was drawn to Bao\u2019er, who was operating the machine.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Han Sen\u2019s daughter? You guys are all together? We\u2019ve put so much manpower into looking for you!\u201d Kiek realized what was going on. He looked furious, and he unleashed his King area. It covered the entire command deck.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang! Pang!\n\nWhen the area landed, the pirates and Fang Qing Yu were crushed to the floor, like iron filings being pulled onto a magnet.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Kiek looked up in confusion, noticing that Bao\u2019er was still piloting the white whale and fighting the Extreme King knights. She wasn\u2019t affected by his area."
