    "text": "The body near the geno hall\u2019s door did not do anything. It looked at Han Sen, who was covered in blue blood, and quietly said, \u201cI hope you will not regret this.\u201d\n\nAfter saying that, the shadow turned around and left. It disappeared inside the bright lights of the hall. The geno hall\u2019s door was closed.\n\nAll the creatures thought there would be a fight that would shock the sky, but who would have known it was to end like that? After the geno hall door closed, the palaces and the god temples closed down as well. Silence returned to permeate the atmosphere of the god palaces.\n\n\u201cOh, my God! Even all of the God Spirits got humiliated and did not do anything to him. Who is that man? Which race does he belong to?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cannot be the boss of the Very High, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Very High are strong, but they cannot be strong enough for so many God Spirits to be afraid of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he want to do to Godfather Han?\u201d\n\nEvery race had been talking about these events. They were guessing the identities of the man and woman and what it was they sought to do.\n\nThe expression on Sky Palace\u2019s first seat\u2019s face changed. \u201cAlthough the god palaces are there, the God Spirits were ended by the rules of the god palaces. They guarded their god temples, unable to exit their god temples to do battle. That guy spoke with disdain. That person inside the geno hall was actually willing to put up with it. Does that mean the man really is Sacred Leader?\u201d\n\nSky Palace Leader looked at the man for a long time before saying, \u201cHe is not Sacred Leader. Although his blood looks like the blood of the legendary Sacred Leader, you and I both know Sacred Leader cannot still be alive. He is not Sacred Leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter if he is or not. This person can make the guy inside the geno hall scared. I am afraid he is in big trouble. Why is he soaking Han Sen in his blood? What\u2019s that for?\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat\u2019s expression looked scared.\n\nSky Palace Leader quietly moaned and said, \u201cYou said Han Sen came from the sanctuaries. If that is true, he might not possess pure crystallizer blood. I am afraid this entire thing is not so simple.\u201d\n\nWhile they were both talking, the man pulled his hand back. The wound on his hand was already healed. Han Sen\u2019s body was dyed blue by the blue blood. It was like a blue fairy glowing with a blue light.\n\nThe blood was being absorbed like a sponge. It went into his skin. Han Sen\u2019s body returned to normal. He had black hair and white skin.\n\nIn his veins, fresh red blood was soaked by the blue blood. It became the blue blood. The man, who stood beneath the umbrella, took a few steps back. He looked as if he was a sculptor examining the breadth of his creation. He watched Han Sen with keen interest.\n\nHan Sen felt like the blood in his body was boiling. Even the time cycle did not stop the blue blood power roaring in his body.\n\nHis red blood was crystallized. After being touched by the blue blood, it started to melt. It carried a weird and strange power. It went into Han Sen\u2019s organs and muscles. His veins were like many blue, small snakes. They were showing across his skin.\n\n\u201cRoar!\u201d Han Sen looked at the sky and made some painful moaning noises. In that moaning noise, his entire body\u2019s blue flame was like an exploding volcanic eruption. Han Sen\u2019s entire body was wrapped up in it. At this moment, the time loop composed by Moment God did not come to affect him. He had been set free from the trap.\n\n\u201cOf course, Han Sen is not a pure crystallizer,\u201d Sacred Leader said with a sigh. \u201cHis body has Sacred Leader\u2019s blood. He cannot combine with the blue blood power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you people?\u201d Han Sen was set free. He looked at the man beneath the umbrella. Now, he felt like his body was full of weird power.\n\nAlthough Han Sen thought this man was Human King, he could not be entirely sure.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter who I am. You just need to know that your power was gifted to you by me. That will be enough.\u201d After speaking, the man turned around and went to the Moment God Temple. The red-clothed woman was still holding the umbrella from behind. The two of them quickly left the Moment God Temple and disappeared into space.\n\nHan Sen had no time to find out who that man was. Sorting out the trouble there was the most important task at hand. He could not allow Bao\u2019er to be trapped there.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He sprinted toward Moment God and used his light scissors to approach her. One white and one dragon, two dragons, were headed for Moment God\u2019s neck.\n\nKatcha-cha!\n\nThe power of the light scissors broke a few strands of Moment God\u2019s hair. She had a red mark on her neck. In the next time cycle, Moment God returned to normal.\n\n\u201cAlthough the light scissors can sever time powers, the damage it deals is not strong. Because I have blue blood, I escape the binding of the time loop. They are still in the time loop. It is pointless for me to kill Moment God since the time loop will remain and she will resurrect.\u201d Han Sen frowned. He felt his body\u2019s blue blood power, but he could not use that power.\n\nHe gave up the idea of killing Moment God. He flashed away and went to Sun Moon God Ape. He tried to pull him away from Moment God Temple.\n\nHan Sen did not dare try and use Bao\u2019er and Golden Growler as a test for this method, so he had to try it on Sun Moon God Ape.\n\nHan Sen quickly discovered that he could not pull him away from the time loop. No matter where he went, he re-appeared inside the time cycle. His body could not leave the Moment God Temple area.\n\n\u201cWhat to do?\u201d Han Sen kept thinking of ideas.\n\nRight now, he could use his blue blood powers. He could ignore Moment\u2019s End power, so he could get out of there.\n\nBut Bao\u2019er and Golden Growler were trapped there. Han Sen could not let that slide.\n\nIn that situation, even if Han Sen used his super God Spirit body, that would only make him not be affected by the time loop. He could not save Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cBlue blood power is not affected by the time loop. If I can control this power, I do not know if I can use it to kill Moment God.\u201d Han Sen thought about the man who put the blue blood in him. Wherever the blood touched, it would not be affected by the time loop.\n\nHan Sen tried to control the blue blood power, but it did not fare well. He could not control the power.\n\nHan Sen hesitated. He cast Blood-Pulse Sutra. Han Sen knew there was a geno art that could control blue blood power, but he was worried. Thus, he did not use Blood-Pulse Sutra. Now, he could not care for much.\n\nBlood-Pulse Sutra opened. The blue blood power in his body was running like mad with the Blood-Pulse Sutra. The speed of the blood\u2019s flow was way over Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s speed. It was not Blood-Pulse Sutra controlling the blood power to run. The blood power was pulling the Blood-Pulse Sutra to run like mad.\n\nIn a palace, Human King squinted. He looked at Han Sen\u2019s black eyes turn blue and said to himself, \u201cIt is starting.\u201d"
