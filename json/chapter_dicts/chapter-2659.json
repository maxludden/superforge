    "text": "Although creatures that came from the star fruits always started at first tier, the lowest King rank, they were still adults. Han Sen could help them develop by providing them with resources, but there was a limit to how much they could evolve. Bringing most of these Kings up to deified would be an impossible task. Half-deified was likely as far as they could go.\n\nHe had yet to find a deified xenogeneic, and that alone disappointed Han Sen.\n\nExquisite comforted him by saying, \u201cFew of the fruit hold deified xenogeneics, so it isn\u2019t strange that you haven\u2019t found one yet. You still have another 40 chances, too. There is no need to rush this process. If your luck is decent, then one or two of your 50 fruit should hold deified xenogeneics.\u201d\n\nWhat she said was correct, but it still made Han Sen depressed.\n\n\u201cDad, Bao\u2019er wants to pick some fruit, too,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, looking up at Han Sen and tugging at his clothes.\n\nSince Exquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking, Han Sen was careful to keep his mind blank. He told Bao\u2019er, \u201cOkay. You can help Daddy choose some star fruit, then.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er was enthused, and she began to look around with wide eyes. Not long after, she pointed at a star fruit in particular and said, \u201cI want that one.\u201d\n\nHan Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and went there. He flew to the top of the star fruit, and Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand touched the point where the fruit and branch connected. Then, the star fruit fell.\n\nHan Sen watched the star fruit\u2019s shell melt away. He knew Bao\u2019er always had good luck with things like this, so he was hoping to take advantage of Bao\u2019er\u2019s good luck to amass an army of deified fighters.\n\nThe shell began to peel away, revealing the xenogeneic on the inside. Han Sen looked carefully at the strange xenogeneic.\n\nIts body was very small, barely larger than Han Sen\u2019s clenched fist. It had really big ears and a tiny, Q-shaped tail. The body was stout and circular. It looked like a fat, little, pink pig.\n\n\u201cWhat is this xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Exquisite. He could sense that the lifeforce of the creature he had just discovered wasn\u2019t strong. It was just like the other xenogeneics he had selected. It didn\u2019t have the presence that a deified creature would have, either. And presence aside, it certainly didn\u2019t look like a powerful warrior.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t recognize every xenogeneic in existence,\u201d Exquisite said with a shake of her head.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Bao\u2019er\u2019s luck doesn\u2019t always pan out in my favor. I thought she could get me a bunch of deified xenogeneics.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\n\nExquisite rolled her eyes. This man was actually using his daughter for his own gain. She had never seen someone this obscene before. There seemed to be no limits to his shamelessness.\n\nBut Bao\u2019er seemed to really love the fat little creature, and she bent over and picked the pig up. She rubbed its fat body because it felt really good to touch.\n\n\u201cDad! Can I have this little pig as my pet?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked Han Sen while looking at him.\n\n\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Upon seeing that the little pig wasn\u2019t a deified xenogeneic, Han Sen was fine with giving it to her as a pet. He had enough King class xenogeneics as it was.\n\nBao\u2019er was so happy to receive the creature, but she didn\u2019t sign a contract with it before waking it up.\n\nExquisite twitched in shock. Bao\u2019er had woken the creature up without signing a contract. Xenogeneics without a contract were as dangerous as any wild xenogeneic.\n\nBut after the little pig woke up, it showed no signs of aggression. It lifted its round body and started running around Bao\u2019er joyously. It looked very happy.\n\nBao\u2019er picked it up, and the little pig didn\u2019t resist. It rubbed its face against Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cThank God it isn\u2019t an aggressive xenogeneic.\u201d Exquisite felt relieved.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, continue,\u201d Han Sen said to Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er nodded. She let the little pig go and then flew to another star fruit. The little pig took off after Bao\u2019er, its bum wiggling.\n\nBao\u2019er swiftly decided on another fruit. The flesh of the falling fruit sloughed away, and when the slumbering xenogeneic inside was revealed, Han Sen and Exquisite were given a fright.\n\nIt was another little pig. It looked exactly the same as the first one that Bao\u2019er had chosen, and it was the size of a man\u2019s fist. It was chubby, too. The two little pigs now looked like twins.\n\n\u201cWeird. Two different star fruits shouldn\u2019t yield the same xenogeneic twice in a row. Yet these two appear to be of the same race. Why has she found two little pigs that are identical?\u201d Exquisite looked at the pigs in confusion.\n\nHan Sen looked at the two pigs, and he realized there was a difference between them.\n\nWhen he looked closely, he realized there was a white symbol on the forehead of each pig. Since the symbols were almost the same color as the pigs, the symbols were difficult to see unless you were very close to the pigs.\n\nThe forehead spell that was on each pig was different, however. Han Sen had no clue what they meant.\n\nHan Sen looked at Exquisite. Exquisite shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this means, either. There are too many different kinds of xenogeneics. Perhaps this is one of the rare breeds. But judging from their presence, they should only be King class. And they aren\u2019t aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is Bao\u2019er\u2019s luck broken today?\u201d Han Sen thought glumly. She had just discovered a pair of little pigs, and they wouldn\u2019t even attack. They seemed useless. They wouldn\u2019t even be useful as slaves.\n\nBao\u2019er took the two little pigs with her to open up more fruit, and what happened next made Han Sen and Exquisite freeze in place. She found another little pig.\n\nBefore Han Sen could say anything, Bao\u2019er started jumping around the star tree. She kicked down many star fruits. More than a dozen of them were falling through the air before Han Sen could open his mouth to protest.\n\nExquisite quickly teleported over to Bao\u2019er to pick her up.\n\nThe star fruits fell, burning like dying suns. They quickly dissolved and revealed the xenogeneics inside.\n\nHan Sen and Exquisite\u2019s eyeballs almost popped out of their skulls. Inside those star fruits were more of the little pigs.\n\nThe small pigs woke up fast. They opened their eyes as soon as their shells melted away. In moments, they were all merrily running around the first two pigs. They trotted next to Bao\u2019er, and they looked very happy.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Even Exquisite\u2019s face was wrought with confusion.\n\nIt was a single breed of xenogeneic, yet there were so many of them. The star tree had never done anything like this before.\n\nHan Sen and Exquisite looked over the pigs, and aside from the spells on their foreheads, everything about them was the same.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, you have collected so many pigs. You should let me open the rest,\u201d Han Sen said with a strained smile. He\u2019d been hoping Bao\u2019er would get him a few deified xenogeneics, but it didn\u2019t look like that was happening anytime soon. And at this point, Bao\u2019er could start her own pig farm.\n\nThere were sixteen little pink pigs running around. They all lined up around Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er didn\u2019t comment on what had happened, but she seemed very pleased with her choice of fruits. She didn\u2019t show any desire to pick more of them."
