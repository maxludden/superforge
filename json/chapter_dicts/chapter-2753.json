Uncle Nine\u2019s Very High Sense was at a very high level, so the chances of him getting emotional were very low.\n\nBut now, he looked rather shaken. Not saying anything further, he took Han Sen and Exquisite and headed to see the leader. Clearly, this was a matter of some importance.\n\n\u201cUncle Nine, is Han Sen in a dangerous situation?\u201d Exquisite couldn\u2019t help but ask.\n\nUncle Nine nodded and said, \u201cWe will talk about it when we reach the leader. This is a very serious matter. If we don\u2019t sort this out correctly, it could have terrible consequences.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Uncle Nine didn\u2019t wait for a response from either Han Sen or Exquisite. He rolled up his sleeves and teleported away with both of them.\n\n\u201cOld Nine, what brings you here? Why the rush?\u201d The Very High Leader was resting on a rocking chair inside a wooden tower. When he saw Uncle Nine bring Han Sen and Exquisite into his wooden home, he frowned.\n\nInstead of explaining, Uncle Nine merely pointed to Han Sen and the blood coral and said, \u201cLeader, look at his body.\u201d\n\nThe Very High Leader was confused, but when he saw the blood coral and Han Sen\u2019s scales, his face changed. He was the leader of the entire race, but he shot to his feet in surprise. His eyes widened as he stared at Han Sen and the blood coral. He couldn\u2019t even blink.\n\nHan Sen now knew for sure that this would be a very troublesome affair. If even the Very High Leader was showing such a strong reaction, that meant the situation was already very serious. Far more so than Han Sen had initially believed.\n\nHan Sen was going to ask what was going on, but Uncle Nine already opened his mouth to inquire, \u201cLeader, is this what I think it is?\u201d\n\nThe Very High Leader nodded his head heavily. After a while, he spoke in a distant tone of voice. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it has happened.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing the Very High Leader\u2019s confirmation, Uncle Nine\u2019s face looked even dourer.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d he asked the Very High Leader seriously, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWe must suppress this. We can\u2019t take any chances,\u201d the Very High Leader responded without hesitation.\n\n\u201cSir, what is wrong with Han Sen?\u201d Exquisite asked, now deeply worried about what was going on.\n\nThe Very High Leader and Uncle Nine stared silently at Han Sen. After a pause, the Very High Leader said, \u201cThis is something that began in the Sacred era. Back then, the Very High were not so grand and famous, and the Sky had yet to splinter from us. The strongest race in the universe was Sacred, and Sacred was also the strongest faction.\u201d\n\nThe Very High Leader paused, and his expression was unreadable. \u201cAccording to our historical records, a disaster struck our race. It prompted us to ask Sacred for their help. In response, Sacred sent an elite to Outer Sky to help us overcome the challenge. But for some reason, the elite of Sacred died in the Buried Dragon Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs whatever is happening to me related to the Sacred elite?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nSacred Leader nodded and said, \u201cThat elite sacrificed himself to help us out of the disaster. But he was cursed by his opponent due to his actions.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes narrowed and he asked, \u201cIf that elite is dead, why does the curse still exist?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ancestors thought that the matter came to a close when the Sacred elite was killed. But evidently, they were wrong. Your body is growing scales. That means the curse didn\u2019t end with the Sacred elite\u2019s death\u2026\u201d Uncle Nine answered, pointing to the blood coral and the scales on Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of curse is this?\u201d Exquisite asked with worry.\n\nThe Very High Leader and Uncle Nine looked at each other. Uncle Nine sighed and said, \u201cThe curse proclaimed that after the Sacred elite died, he would someday rise again. He would become a monster that only knew how to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ancestors believed the Sacred elite was completely destroyed, far too damaged to be revived. They thought the calamity was over, but\u2026\u201d the Very High Leader trailed off, looking at Han Sen\u2019s blood coral. After a while, he said, \u201cBut the blood coral you are holding is just like the geno armament wielded by the Sacred elite. The scales you are growing look just like his scale armor. That Sacred elite might end up being reborn through your body. That is the nature of the curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there no way to erase this infection?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t excited about this news at all.\n\nVery High Leader and Uncle Nine shook their heads apprehensively. Exquisite quickly said, \u201cMister Leader, with your power, there must be something you can do. Please save Han Sen.\u201d\n\nThe Very High Leader sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not remaining inactive because I don\u2019t want to help. I really can\u2019t. The scary being that cursed the Sacred elite was a real god. That Sacred elite fought that god, when the god was chased away, the toxic curse came into effect. It cannot be removed with our power.\u201d\n\n\u201cA god cursed the Sacred elite?\u201d Han Sen asked, his heart suddenly pounding.\n\nThe Very High Leader said, \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t believe this universe has gods, but they do exist. Most ordinary creatures cannot see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in gods. What was this god called? And what was that Sacred elite\u2019s name?\u201d Han Sen asked the Very High Leader, trying to keep his excitement under wraps.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about what happened. Not much detail was recorded about that fight. It appears that someone tried to erase the details of it. We only know that the fight was called God\u2019s Disaster, and that the Sacred elite was named Dragon. Those are the only details we have.\u201d\n\nThe Very High Leader looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cIf Dragon\u2019s power is being reborn through you, then we will have to suppress you. If the curse is real, then we can\u2019t allow you to become a killing monster that might destroy the universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon\u2019s power might not end up being reborn through Han Sen\u2019s body. Maybe the whole reborn thing means Dragon himself. Didn\u2019t Han Sen say that the blood coral forest contains the carcass of a monster? Maybe that is the real Dragon\u2026\u201d Exquisite quickly suggested.\n\nThe Very High Leader nodded and said, \u201cThat coral forest and the body down below will be suppressed as well.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think things were going too well. The Very High were planning to lock him up like an animal.\n\n\u201cMister Leader, I might be infected, but perhaps there is a way for me to save myself. The Very High have many elites, so there has to be a way to remove these small things from my body,\u201d Han Sen said quickly.\n\n\u201cWe will try our best, but if nothing works, we might have to lock you up to prevent something very bad from happening.\u201d The Very High Leader was a very logical man. Like most Very High, he didn\u2019t get emotional when he faced a crisis. He sorted out problems in the most efficient way that he could.\n\nHan Sen knew that right now, he was like a patient who had a very contagious disease. The best way to deal with it was to quarantine him. The Very High Leader was right. But Han Sen didn\u2019t see being locked in a cage as an acceptable solution. He felt very upset."
