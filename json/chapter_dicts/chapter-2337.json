    "text": "Seeing Bai Qing Xia striking with his palm, Han Sen unleashed another Shocking Sky Punch.\n\nHe would have liked to use other techniques, but he had only just started using his Bai Yi disguise. He hadn\u2019t yet had the time to learn any other skills. He had been lucky to learn this punch from the Extreme King alpha\u2019s statue, but using other skills might expose him.\n\nThe Shocking Sky Punch was a technique that every member of the Extreme King had to learn. Although it was basic, it was still very powerful. It would be ridiculous to call the skill invincible, but it could challenge a surprising number of other techniques.\n\nPang!\n\nThe fist and the palm hit each other. Han Sen\u2019s Shocking Sky Punch blocked Bai Qing Xia\u2019s day and night cycle split. But still, no one was winning.\n\n\u201cHuh. Bai Yi\u2019s Shocking Sky Punch managed to block the day and night cycle split? Today is a weird day. We are witnessing so many bizarre things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are both first-tier Kings. How can a Shocking Sky Punch break a day and night cycle split?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bai family has too many powerful members. Those two princes have never really revealed themselves before. I wouldn\u2019t have expected the two to possess powers like this. They are both so talented, and it seems as if the fight between these two princes has only just begun.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nEveryone was talking. Instead of attacking Han Sen again, Bai Qing Xia just stared at his opponent. A long time later, he said, \u201cYou are very special, Brother Sixteen. It was no wonder that you were able to claim the alpha statue.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not bad, either,\u201d Han Sen admitted with a nod.\n\nBai Qing Xia raised his head. He looked up to the king tree and said, \u201cThe king tree is going to wake up, so we should cease our fighting for now. If you are here to seek protection from King\u2019s Cover, then let us determine a victory through how many Kingese we both receive. How does that sound?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here on a stroll. I don\u2019t care if I get Kingese or not,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBai Qing Xia laughed. \u201cAre you afraid to lose?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? You really think I can actually be afraid of you?\u201d Han Sen grunted dismissively.\n\n\u201cThen it is settled. We will determine the victor based on how many Kingese we each receive. Whoever has the most Kingese will win.\u201d After saying this, Bai Qing Xia returned to the king dragon\u2019s head.\n\nHan Sen had no idea how to get the Kingese. So, he pretended to shoot Bai Qing Xia a look of contempt. He flew to another king dragon\u2019s head and sat down just like the other prince.\n\nSeeing Bai Qing Xia close his eyes atop the dragon\u2019s head, Han Sen pretended to do the same. The blood kirin sat down next to him.\n\n\u201cBai Qing Xia and Bai Yi are both seeking King Cover\u2019s protection. I wonder how many Kingese they will receive?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, I would have thought they would be lucky to earn one or two. But now, it is hard to tell. Those two have been keeping secrets, and it is obvious they are looking to impress everyone. They\u2019re probably still hiding much of their power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. I didn\u2019t expect two normal princes to hide their powers in the way they have. It looks like this is the Extreme King\u2019s strongest era.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! As the royal children grow stronger, their fights will grow stronger as well. I do not know if that is good or bad.\u201d\n\nThe king tree\u2019s leaves started to glow, but few of the royal children went looking for the primary root king dragons. Most of them wanted to watch Han Sen and Bai Qing Xia.\n\nEvery leaf on the king tree had some Kingese. When the king tree woke up, the Kingese on the leaves grew brighter. Under their light, the leaves looked gold.\n\nKingese was the blood pulse of the leaves. Every king leaf\u2019s blood pulse was different. As time passed, the blood pulse became brighter. The Kingese brightened into gold symbols branded onto the gold leaves, and each symbol gave off a different sensation.\n\nSome of them were strong like fire. Some of them felt like rushing water. Some of them were heavy on the ground, and others were deep like an abyss.\n\nAlthough Han Sen couldn\u2019t decipher the Kingese, he could feel their power. He could understand what they meant.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because Han Sen was good at learning. It was because the power of each Kingese was linked to a substance. There was a deeper meaning to them than a mere hieroglyph. Han Sen didn\u2019t have to learn them. He just had to see the shape of the item that was related to the Kingese. Then, he could recognize what they meant.\n\n\u201cThis world is so big. Everything and anything can exist here. Even the leaves of the king tree are in some way connected to the fabric of the world. It\u2019s all-inclusive. How amazing.\u201d Han Sen sighed, and then he thought to himself, \u201cIf I could dig it out and haul it back to the Alliance, I wonder if it would still grow?\u201d\n\nThe king tree and its leaves woke up. The Kingese was shining brightly. A king dragon nearby roared and then fell into the ground.\n\nHan Sen saw that Bai Qing Xia hadn\u2019t moved yet. He furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cDoes he not want the protection of the Kingese? Why is he sitting on the head of a dragon? That way, he will not be able to go underground.\u201d\n\nThat was what Han Sen was thinking, at least. He didn\u2019t move. He maintained his position just as Bai Qing Xia did, sitting atop the dragon head.\n\nThe king dragons around them were all drilling into the soil. And then, both of their own king dragons started to move. Bai Qing Xia still didn\u2019t move.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. The king dragon didn\u2019t go underground as the other dragons did. Instead, it raised its head and went up to the top of the tree.\n\nThe boughs of the tree high above were like a golden sky. The Kingese was shining like a platter of gold stars. The two dragons kept going up and up, as if they were shooting off into the cosmos.\n\nIf someone hadn\u2019t actually seen it in person, it would have been difficult to imagine how beautiful it looked.\n\nHan Sen was standing atop the dragon\u2019s head, staring at the shining Kingese. It was like he was in a dreamland.\n\nThose two king dragons stopped moving forward after reaching the halfway point. After all, they were just the roots of the king tree, and there was only so far that they could go. They would have to disconnect from the king tree to go further.\n\nBai Qing Xia opened his eyes. He stood up, looked at the Kingese, and said, \u201cThe older one should do this first, so go ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just sight-seeing. You go first,\u201d Han Sen said simply.\n\nHe had no idea how to gain the approval and protection of the Kingese.\n\nBai Qing Xia didn\u2019t decline the offer to go first. He looked up to the Kingese, and then his body started to glow with a white light. The white became more intense, and it made Bai Qing Xia\u2019s body brighter. It was like he was becoming a transparent jade stone.\n\n\u201cKing body?\u201d Han Sen squinted. Bai Qing Xia was still standing on his dragon\u2019s head. His body was so bright, it was like he was wholly wrapped-up by a godlight. It wasn\u2019t just his flesh, either; even his hair looked like jade.\n\nWith his king body\u2019s power spreading, the Kingese on the king leaves answered. A king leaf started to shake. It began to make a rustling noise, like it was caught in a wind that affected nothing else."
