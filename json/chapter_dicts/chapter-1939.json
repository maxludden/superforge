    "text": "\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Hai\u2019er.\n\nHai\u2019er sauntered casually behind him. \u201cI gave you my end of the bargain, so of course I\u2019m going to follow you. Heaven is going to open in a few days, and until then, I am attaching myself to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to listen to Burning Lamp Alpha\u2019s speech. We can meet there,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else for me to go, anyway. I might as well follow you. It might be nice to meet up with Knife Queen, too.\u201d Hai\u2019er really wanted to follow him.\n\nHan Sen, seeing that Hai\u2019er wasn\u2019t leaving, allowed her to tag along.\n\nThere were a few days to go until the speech was to commence, and it felt like forever for Han Sen. On the day of the speech, Yisha still hadn\u2019t revealed herself.\n\n\u201cWeird. Where is Yisha? Did she go to the speech area straight away?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cAre you really Knife Queen\u2019s student? Where is she?\u201d When the speech was about to begin, Hai\u2019er cast a suspicious glance at Han Sen. She was starting to think she didn\u2019t know who he really was.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then take your tablet back. Then we can go our separate ways.\u201d Han Sen held it out to her.\n\nOver the past few days, he had researched the text on the tablet. It looked like something very profound, but there was no beginning or end to the text it included. It was just a section of a greater geno art. You couldn\u2019t learn anything from that.\n\nHan Sen found out the tablet was rather well-known, though. The section that Hai\u2019er had was likely very real.\n\nThe Virtual Tablet had quite a lot of storage, and the geno art filled all of it. If he only had one piece, then he only had one part of the geno art. It was no wonder why Hai\u2019er was willing to give it to him.\n\n\u201cNo! You\u2019ve already read the contents. What\u2019s the point of giving it back to me now?\u201d Hai\u2019er shook her head.\n\nHan Sen ignored her, and he continued to frown.\n\nThe speech started, and Yisha had yet to return. Without Yisha, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have the Buddha\u2019s invitation to enter their Heaven. He could not listen to the speech in the palace, so he\u2019d have to stay in the plaza and listen alongside the commoners.\n\nBurning Lamp Alpha couldn\u2019t be seen from the plaza. The audience could only listen to his voice ringing out of yellow speakers.\n\nMany creatures listened to the speech through the Buddha sound system. When Han Sen heard what was being spoken, he thought it was very meaningful. He felt as if his heart had leveled up.\n\nBut after thinking about it a little more, he thought it was indeed a little too vague. If you could do what the speech told you to do, you would have to be a saint. You wouldn\u2019t have to learn anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault! I am from the Pirate! I am supposed to listen from the palace. Now I\u2019m stuck in the plaza with these lowlifes and you!\u201d Hai\u2019er sounded upset.\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cYou probably weren\u2019t going to listen all that well, anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter where you were standing when you heard him speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different. Hearing it from the palace is a recognition of your identity. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re there,\u201d Hai\u2019er said. Han Sen didn\u2019t think too much on the speech, though. He was concerned for Yisha, who was still a no-show.\n\nFar away, in a stone pavilion in the southwest corner of Buddha Kingdom, an old man was sitting in front of a table. It looked as if he was dozing off.\n\nThere was a game of chess sitting on the table, and it was in the midst of a stalemate.\n\nYisha was sitting opposite the man, examining the stalemate in play atop the table. She was holding a piece, trying to decide on her next move.\n\nThe pavilion was fairly ordinary, but it gave others a feeling of separation from the world outside. It was like a realm that did not exist in full.\n\nTime passed, and Yisha sat as still as if she had been turned to stone.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t see Burning Lamp Alpha, and the speech lasted the entire day. After that, the creatures all showed their thanks to the Alpha, kowtowing before the palace.\n\nThe speech ended, and the heavens opened. Countless creatures poured in towards the opening.\n\nHan Sen and Hai\u2019er were stuck in the crowd, looking at the way to Heaven.\n\nThere were eight doors in the Buddha city, and three of them were open. Five of them were always shut. One of the doors led to Heaven, and that was the only way to Heaven. It was situated in the west.\n\nThe western door was now open, and when they looked out at it, they could see a Buddha light. It obviously did not lead to the land outside the city, as one might expect.\n\nHan Sen still hadn\u2019t seen Yisha, so he decided to move with the crowd towards the western door. When he went through the western door, he was not taken outside the city. He found himself in a desert.\n\nNothing was visible on those desert wastes; not even cacti. It was just yellow sand, sizzling beneath a bright, hot sky.\n\nAfter entering the desert, Han Sen heard something, like someone whispering near him. It almost sounded like someone speaking the Buddha catchphrase, but from an indiscernible source.\n\nThe noise flowed all around him in a constant susurrus. The sound wasn\u2019t loud, but he could hear it clearly. It was like it was coming straight from his brain.\n\nAs he listened to that sound, Han Sen\u2019s body wanted to move along with it. It made him frown.\n\n\u201cDo you hear a noise?\u201d Han Sen asked Hai\u2019er.\n\n\u201cOf course. Did you not know that Heaven has the heavenly sounds?\u201d Hai\u2019er rolled her eyes. If she hadn\u2019t asked around, she wouldn\u2019t have believed Han Sen was the student of Knife Queen. He didn\u2019t know anything.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with these heavenly sounds?\u201d Han Sen was trying to pinpoint its source, but he couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n\nHai\u2019er kept walking and explained, \u201cThe music is everywhere, all across this Heaven. At first, it will feel like it\u2019s nothing. But the longer you hear it for, the deeper it will touch you. If you can\u2019t stay composed and walk through this Heaven in time, your body will begin to dance along with it. It won\u2019t stop until you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s that dangerous, and only ten people can make it through, why are so many people coming here? Aren\u2019t they afraid of dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can turn back before you lose control. You\u2019ll be safe if you do that.\u201d Hai\u2019er looked around, but she could not catch sight of Speechless. Then, she asked, \u201cWhen will you and Speechless meet up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you! We are not in a relationship.\u201d Han Sen looked around and asked, \u201cHow do I know when to keep going or when I should return?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends on who you are. Everyone has fear in their hearts. You turn back when you\u2019ve lost all hope. The more confident and stubborn people are, the more danger they are in.\u201d Hai\u2019er rolled her eyes, and continued on to say, \u201cBut you will be fine. Speechless will protect you, and you will make it to the end.\u201d"
