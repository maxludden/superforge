He counted all the way to 12, then the bells fell quiet.\n\nThe moment the bells stopped, the doors of every palace opened wide. Some of the buildings looked like modern metal structures, while others were crafted like vintage castles. Regardless of their appearances, all of the palaces opened their doors at the same time, as if they had been rigged to do so automatically.\n\nWhen the palace doors opened up, a sense of life came to the previously dead and barren ocean. Han Sen could even hear footsteps echoing from the nearest palace.\n\nEven a person who was almost deaf could have heard those booming footsteps. Each one was like a small earthquake, and the sounds pressed against Han Sen\u2019s eardrums like a physical weight.\n\nThose earthquake-like footsteps drew Han Sen\u2019s gaze toward the palace\u2019s door, and he soon saw something massive emerging through the open door frame.\n\nIt was a giant that was 100 meters tall. Although it was big, it didn\u2019t seem clumsy or awkward. Instead, it moved its massive body with grace, exuding a sense of explosive power with every motion. If the being wished to, Han Sen figured it could cast power with enough strength and speed to destroy an entire planet with ease.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s brows furrowed as he noticed the manacles attached to the giant\u2019s hands and legs. It gave him the sense that this was a prisoner of some notoriety. The giant\u2019s eyes looked very dull, and it just stared forward into space.\n\nHan Sen quickly realized that the giant he was watching wasn\u2019t the only one that had emerged. A giant now stood in front of every palace across that entire ocean.\n\nAll the other giants were bound hand and foot as well, and their eyes were lifeless. They stood quietly in front of their respective buildings.\n\n\u201cThey have such large bodies. They aren\u2019t sinking, despite the fact that they\u2019re standing on the surface of the sea. The current seems to be moving them, though. They\u2019re all being pulled in the same direction.\u201d Han Sen hesitated. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should follow and see what was up, as all of this seemed like weird nonsense.\n\nOuter Sky shouldn\u2019t have allowed a foreign object to conduct space teleportation, but the Four Sheep Cube had brought them effortlessly to this strange sea.\n\nHan Sen had visited too many weird places in his time. So, even though this place was very strange, Han Sen wasn\u2019t too shaken. What caught him off guard, however, was the presence of those giants.\n\nThere was an incredible gravitas to the presence of the giants, and it made Han Sen wonder if they were deified elites.\n\nBut as Han Sen thought about it, he realized that he could see 200 or 300 of the giants. If they were all deified elites, he couldn\u2019t imagine what race they must have represented to have so many deified elites in their ranks.\n\nEven more frightening, these power giants were being treated like prisoners. Their limbs were chained, and something was wrong with their eyes. Who could have imprisoned giants like these?\n\nHan Sen wanted to go and find out, but he concluded that it would be too dangerous. If something had been able to trap those giants, it could likely detect Han Sen\u2019s presence, especially if he went looking for it.\n\n\u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s just find a way to leave this creepy place.\u201d Han Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and returned to the Four Sheep Cube.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to go see?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, looking at the giants that were drifting away on the currents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. For now, let\u2019s just figure out a way to get out of here,\u201d Han Sen answered with a shake of his head. He walked over to the Four Sheep Cube. He remembered Bao\u2019er stepping on one of the sheep heads, which triggered the whirlpool that had brought them to this place.\n\n\u201cNow, we have to take a risk.\u201d Han Sen directed the small pigs to go back into the pool of water in the Four Sheep Cube. He picked up Bao\u2019er and jumped in after them, but not before stepping on one of the bronze sheep heads.\n\nKatcha-cha!\n\nWhen Han Sen\u2019s foot came down on the bronze sheep head, the two goldfish started to swim around like mad again. The water in the cube became a whirlpool once more.\n\n\u201cWe must go back.\u201d Han Sen once more felt a magnetic force emanating from the cube. He and Bao\u2019er were sucked into the cube and its whirlpool. The 16 little piggies were spinning around inside like mad, too.\n\nWhen the water flow stopped, and Han Sen emerged from the cube, he realized with pleasant surprise that they were back on the shores of Underworld Lake.\n\n\u201cIs the Four Sheep Cube a teleporter? If that is the case, I wonder where it sent us. And what were those giants?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Four Sheep Cube as he mulled these questions over. He continued to think to himself, saying, \u201cThis bronze sheep head gives me the ability to teleport. I wonder what the other three sheep heads do. Does each one provide a different function? Or will the others send me to different places?\u201d\n\nHan Sen gave the matter some thought. His curiosity regarding the object had increased immensely, but he didn\u2019t want to take too many risks. If his instincts were correct, those giants were deifieds. And if that was true, wherever they were going had to be very dangerous.\n\nBased on that assumption, Han Sen imagined that the other three bronze sheep heads would lead him to someplace else that was dangerous, too.\n\nDespite all his strengths and talents, Han Sen had a flaw. He could be too curious. He knew how dangerous that sea filled with giants could be, but now that he had discovered such a weird and mysterious place, it would drive him insane if he didn\u2019t go and find out its secrets.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, you stay here.\u201d Han Sen set Bao\u2019er down, planning to visit the giant world alone.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Bao\u2019er clutched Han Sen\u2019s leg, not wanting to let go.\n\n\u201cThat place is too dangerous. I will go and scout ahead. If it looks fun, I will take you there.\u201d Han Sen had to comfort Bao\u2019er for a while before she agreed to stay behind.\n\nHan Sen took Bao\u2019er someplace far away before returning to the Four Sheep Cube. He used his hand to press down on the sheep head.\n\nJust like before, the two goldfish in the water started to swim in a swift circle. They created a whirlpool in the water that sucked Han Sen inside.\n\nWhen Han Sen emerged from the Four Sheep Cube, he found himself standing atop that big sea again. The giants had all disappeared. He looked at the sun, and the clock was showing that only a dozen minutes had passed.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen suddenly heard a massive explosion come from where the giants had gone. He could feel the spike of power coming from that direction.\n\nAs the power shook the air around him, Han Sen\u2019s face changed. He whispered to himself in a hoarse voice, \u201cThat shockwave\u2026 It feels like Break Six Skies. Are these giants the legendary Breakskies?\u201d\n\nBreak Six Skies was the secret geno art of the Breakskies. The Destroyed were one of the few races with the blood of the Breakskies in them, but they were never as good as the Breakskies themselves.\n\nThe legends of the universe claimed that the Breakskies were unable to breed. So, the universe gradually forgot them. If they wanted to extend their bloodline, they had to interbreed with other races to create hybrid Breakskies, like the Destroyed.\n\nIf these giants really were Breakskies, then the story of the Breakskies\u2019 fall wasn\u2019t as simple as it initially seemed."
