It had been destroyed within one second, so whatever lurked inside the valley was scary.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to rush. Watch this.\u201d Xie Qing King flipped open his book and drew something else with his fingertips.\n\nNot long after, another leopard came leaping out of the pages. It didn\u2019t run straight into the valley, and instead came to heel and crouch near Xie Qing King.\n\nXie Qing King kept wagging his finger across the book, and after a few minutes, another four leopards joined the first. When done, he said, \u201cOkay! This is the maximum I can do.\u201d\n\nHe commanded the five leopards to enter the mist of the valley, all in a horizontal line.\n\nEach leopard ran forward at the same time, all together, but they kept a few yards of space between them. When they entered the valley, there was a movement from within the fog.\n\nBut then, all too quickly, the valley echoed with the sounds of squealing again. The red mist of the valley rumbled and swirled, as the pictures on Xie Qing King\u2019s book began to disappear, one after another.\n\nWithin a mere few seconds, the pictures of all the leopards had been erased. It likely indicated that the shadows that had been spawned and sent into the mist had been destroyed.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s face turned pale. The death of the leopards meant nothing to him, but he had exerted a lot of his own energy by summoning so many. That had cost him a lot.\n\n\u201cSo, did you find out what\u2019s going on inside the valley?\u201d Han Sen asked Xie Qing King, looking right at him.\n\nXie Qing King told him, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I didn\u2019t see anything, but when the leopards were killed, one second elapsed between each death. So I assume the leopards were all killed by a single entity. I can also guess that if a creature can kill my shadows so quickly, the creature must have four times our potential speed. It could be an Earl or higher, but with a hidden power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it is an Earl, that\u2019s nothing to sweat about. I have the Teeth Rabbit shoes, remember? The speed of those is no worse than an Earl, and I also have the new Marquise xenogeneic armor. I may not be able to activate its full potential, but it can most certainly protect me from the attacks of an Earl.\u201d Han Sen looked up to the sky and noticed another magnetic storm that was raging. He could not see the moons of Narrow Moon from where he was, so it was unlikely he\u2019d be gifted their strength.\n\n\u201cWait here.\u201d Gu Qingcheng stopped Han Sen, who was on the verge of entering himself. She pulled out Pure, and a green aura danced across the blade. Then, the sword came alive in a swirl and flew forward into the valley.\n\nDong!\n\nPure flew right into the mist, and shortly after, a crunchy noise sounded. Then, Pure flew back out and right back into Gu Qingcheng\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cMy sword was attacked once,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said, then sheathed the weapon.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go and take a look.\u201d Han Sen donned his Marquise armor and put on his rabbit shoes. He clutched Ghost Teeth Knife in one hand and held his Knife Blank firmly in the other. Then, with much care, he started to step inside.\n\nIt was times like this that Han Sen actually started to miss Wang Yuhang. If the man was there with him, all Han Sen would only have to get Wang Yuhang to stand outside the valley and shout. He would probably draw whatever was inside out, and there\u2019d be no need to go inside.\n\nHan Sen carefully walked into the mist. While the mist had color, he didn\u2019t feel anything when it brushed across him.\n\nAfter a few steps, that changed. All of a sudden, he felt horrid. He wanted to go forward, but he was struck in the back. It was a powerful strike, and he staggered forward.\n\nBefore Han Sen was able to stabilize himself, something else came at him again. It got his arm.\n\nThe creature in the red mist traveled quietly, and actually catching sight of it seemed impossible. Han Sen was very fast, but he didn\u2019t know where he should move until the attacks had already happened. By the time the strikes came, it was too late to dodge. By the time he moved, he\u2019d already been hit.\n\nLuckily, though, Han Sen had the Marquise armor on. It meant the attacks didn\u2019t actually hurt him.\n\nHan Sen ran out of the valley after getting hit again, but the thing inside the mist did not follow. He took a look at what had happened and noticed the scratch marks across his suit. Surprisingly, they weren\u2019t very deep.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng ran up to him to ask.\n\n\u201cOld Qing is right. There is an Earl creature there. Its speed and power aren\u2019t too shabby, and it uses the red mist for cover. It\u2019s practically invisible. I got attacked before I even saw it, every time. I was hit a few times, but even then, I wasn\u2019t able to catch a glimpse. The red mist might have the added ability of masking the senses, because I wasn\u2019t even able to hear its movements,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThis is bad news. If it\u2019s in there and it won\u2019t come out, then we can\u2019t fight it. Entering the mist is pointless, even with the armor that you\u2019re wearing.\u201d Gu Qingcheng frowned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be great if there was some way to draw him out,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cIf he dared to come out, he\u2019d have followed either my sword or Han Sen.\u201d Gu Qingcheng shook her head.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too hard to draw him out, but we\u2019ll need the help of a specialist,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWang Yuhang?\u201d Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng had thought about him, too.\n\n\u201cThere is something awfully strange about this valley. There are creatures guarding this place for a reason. I am afraid that something important might be about to happen here. We can\u2019t delay this,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said.\n\n\u201cI gave Wang Yuhang some xenogeneic genes, and after he ate them, he managed to break through. He was able to absorb Life Geno Essences, and after he maxed out, he went to the Alliance. We should be able to bring him here fairly easily. But the people out there know how many people Planet Eclipse currently holds, and the documents are all in files. If someone else shows up, it might be difficult to explain. I have to use the recruitment excuse to bring him here,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go quickly and bring more people over. Planet Eclipse has a lot of resources, so the more people the better. With the small amount of us here, there\u2019s not enough to pay the taxes we must pay in a few years,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said.\n\n\u201cThis is what we can do, then. You guys can stay and hunt in the vicinity, just don\u2019t go too deep. And also, keep an eye on the valley. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Han Sen said that, then returned to base.\n\nAfter returning, Han Sen gave Knife Queen a call. Knife Queen knew he\u2019d need more people, so she agreed to his request and sent him an airship. After Icebird Duke picked him up, they left Narrow Moon to recruit.\n\n\u201cWhere would you like to recruit people this time?\u201d Icebird Duke was sounding much friendlier with Han Sen now.\n\nHan Sen had been number one in the Moon God Festival, and he was the very first person to have ever been personally blessed by the Moon God. So, that had certainly boosted his reputation and goodwill.\n\nLearning Teeth Knife and Teeth powers in such a short time wasn\u2019t something that could be accomplished with luck alone. However he had done it, it made Icebird Duke look at him differently."
