    "text": "Dong!\n\nThe young man\u2019s hand almost touched Han Sen\u2019s neck when a knife light suddenly blocked it. The knife light and hand light hit each other. It left a bloody mark on the young man\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cSky Palace\u2019s Under the Sky Knife skill is quite amazing.\u201d The young man looked at the bloody mark on his hand and smiled even harder. He swung his hand. The wound on his hand was gone.\n\nHan Sen dove into Under the Sky mind. He did not move. He just looked at the young man. His knife went down.\n\n\u201cI want to see how much you can endure.\u201d The young man\u2019s hand changed. Time and space also changed.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knife was slower. His place was swapped. The time and space power was similar to the legendary holy body.\n\nBack when Littleflower joined the geno being scroll fight, he had displayed this power.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body\u2019s time and space kept twisting, but the young man could not break Han Sen\u2019s knife skill. He already dodged Han Sen\u2019s attack. He made Han Sen slower, but he could not hurt Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s place was changed, but he was not afraid. He still slashed toward an area where there was no one.\n\nWhen the young man wanted to attack Han Sen\u2019s weak spot, a knife light appeared in space and stopped his hand.\n\nThe young man\u2019s face looked more terrible. He noticed there was something wrong. The space around Han Sen was twisted, but Han Sen had already cast knife lights to stop his attacks. He was being stopped by Han Sen\u2019s knife lights.\n\n\u201cIt looks like your holy body is just like that, yet you want to exceed Qin Xiu. Pah!\u201d Han Sen waved his knife as he spoke.\n\nHan Sen was actually confused. The demon lady and the others said that only Littleflower practiced talents of the holy body, but there were obviously others who had practiced Qin Xiu\u2019s holy body. The holy body was not as rare as the demon lady led him to believe.\n\nThat was why Han Sen used words to offend the young man. He hoped the young man would accidentally spill the beans on some of the holy body\u2019s secrets.\n\n\u201cThat is just the beginning.\u201d The young man looked mad. His eyes turned a weird blue color. Nothing but blue was visible in his eyes.\n\nHis body\u2019s blood vessels were showing. Even the very small blood vessels were like small dragonflies and little snakes around his snake. His blood was starting to show.\n\n\u201cBlue blood.\u201d Han Sen was a bit shocked by this, so he looked right at the young man.\n\nAs the blood changed, the young man\u2019s presence grew scarier. It was like an angry ghost that would eat everything as fuel for its power was coming out from hell.\n\n\u201cYes. I am a blue blood. Qin Xiu used his genes for a blueprint and combined it with better genes. That is why I am here. Although he did not admit it, it is a truth that can never be denied. I am greater than he was. I should be the real Qin Xiu. I should be the real Sacred Leader.\u201d The young man\u2019s eyes looked a little insane.\n\nHan Sen suddenly understood a lot. Back then, Qin Xiu, tried to copy people but gave up for some reason.\n\nHan Sen thought this young man must have been the failed test subjects that Qin Xiu abandoned. Despite what was done to them, they betrayed Sacred.\n\nHe looked at the young man\u2019s face and noted how much he looked like Qin Xiu. He was very similar.\n\nAlthough they looked alike, because Qin Xiu\u2019s presence was so special, the young man did not possess the presence that Qin Xiu had. Thus, Han Sen had not noticed how similar they\n\nwere.\n\nBoom!\n\nWhile Han Sen was checking him out, the young man\u2019s flames turned solid. His whole body was like a transparent crystal.\n\n\u201cThat is\u2026 That is a God Spirit\u2019s presence.\u201d Han Sen frowned as he looked at the young man. What came out from him was the special presence only given off by God Spirits.\n\n\u201cYes. I have Qin Xiu\u2019s genes, and I have an Annihilation class God Spirit\u2019s genes. I am stronger than Qin Xiu. I am the real leader of this world.\u201d The young man\u2019s body was becoming stronger. The armor he had was vaporized by his presence. His naked body was revealed.\n\nHis body was like a crystal. One was able to see the blue blood coursing through his body. The blue-blood power and God Spirit mixed together made his presence very strange. It was like he was a human but not a human. It was like he was a god but not a god.\n\n\u201cIf you are so good, why did not rule the universe after Qin Xiu was killed?\u201d Han Sen deliberately looked at him with disdain.\n\n\u201cThat is Qin Xiu\u2019s fault,\u201d the young man crazily said. \u201cIf he had given me the gene prototype, I would have ruled the world. Those from Sacred and the God Spirits would be crying before my feet.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought the young man was very stable and perhaps end up leaking a secret or two. He quickly asked, \u201cSo, what is the gene prototype?\u201d \u201cIt is\u2026 It is Qin Xiu\u2019s fault\u2026\u201d The young man crazily spoke. His eyes were full of energy. He raised his head and roared to the sky. His scary power was like a volcano erupting.\n\nThe body only had blue blood. In a moment, the blue blood seemed like it was burning. It made the whole body a transparent blue. The flames on the body were blue too.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He was a little bit worried. He was afraid Littleflower might turn out like this young man.\n\nHe had used all the power he had in the Alliance to search for Littleflower inside the sanctuaries, but there had yet to be any news of him. That made him very worried. \u201cQin Xiu! Qin Xiu! What are you doing?\u201d Han Sen thought Qin Xiu was scarier than these God Spirits. At least God Spirits had their rules and principles to follow. Qin Xiu had just done what he pleased. He had not concerned himself with the consequences of his actions. No one was able to stop him. He had no moral compass.\n\nTo be without rules was a very scary thing, and Qin Xiu was the scariest demon in the deep abyss of not having any rules.\n\nKilling God Spirits, using gene technology to mix races\u2026 Even the holy beasts he grew had their horns taken and souls claimed. The genes were used to replicate people. He went against nature.\n\nQin Xiu had done many scary things. It was much scarier than what a God Spirit did.\n\nThe young man, who looked like a blue crystal God Spirit, stared at Han Sen. \u201cAnything related to Qin Xiu should die.\u201d He slowly spoke each word. When he was done, he reached out his hand and continued looking at Han Sen. Suddenly, the blue light was released. It twisted all of space.\n\nHan Sen felt like his body was going left and right in the time and space power. Somehow, he was in front of the young man. The young man\u2019s hand grabbed him by the neck.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d The young man\u2019s face looked murderous and full of rage. His hand was full of power. The blue light was spilling. He was going to break Han Sen\u2019s neck."
