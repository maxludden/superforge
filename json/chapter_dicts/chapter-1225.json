The emperor sought retribution, so he sent a small host of king spirits and super creatures to where the enemy was said to reside. They were all killed,\u201d the elderly man said.\n\n\u201cWho is strong enough to defeat, let alone bully, his son?\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cI think it must be another king spirit,\u201d Old Huang said.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame humans don\u2019t have someone that strong,\u201d the young man said dismally.\n\nAs they walked below the boughs, Old Huang said, \u201cWhy is there a clearing here? This was not here before.\u201d\n\nThe young man responded by saying, \u201cYeah, and look at this swollen tree. Should we check it out?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here to work; we shouldn\u2019t be so nosy,\u201d Old Huang said. Then, the two walked away.\n\nBut as they walked away, they suddenly screamed in fear. They saw a young man standing ahead of them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Scaring us like that! Wait a minute, I haven\u2019t seen you before. When did you come here and where did you come from?\u201d Old Huang asked.\n\nThe young man screamed again, but this time, it was a scream born of glee. He shouted, \u201cHan Sen! It\u2019s Han Sen!\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Zhao, do you know this person?\u201d Old Huang asked.\n\n\u201cAre you telling me you don\u2019t know who President Ji\u2019s son-in-law is?\u201d Little Zhao replied.\n\n\u201cI have been stuck in here for decades. Last I recall, the president was called Wang. I don\u2019t care who this young man is, not after that scare,\u201d Old Huang said.\n\nLittle Zhao approached Han Sen and asked, \u201cWhy are you here? I didn\u2019t know you became a part of Thunder Hell Shelter.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m just checking the real estate value of this place. But tell me, how large is the attacking host?\u201d\n\nOld Huang said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. There\u2019s at least six.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know where the king spirits and super creatures are?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThey are currently in the Thunder Garden. We can\u2019t go there, though,\u201d Old Huang said.\n\n\u201cThanks, I appreciate it. In the meantime, I suggest you two steer clear of the shelter.\u201d Han Sen knew the place they were talking about, so he left the two be.\n\nOld Huang wished to say something more, but Han Sen was already gone.\n\n\u201cStay away from the shelter? What did he mean by that?\u201d Old Huang did not understand.\n\nLittle Zhao was excited, as he knew more about Han Sen and his unbelievable feats. He said, \u201cSomething big is going to happen, old man. Just you watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, he\u2019s going to start something in the shelter? Pah! Have you gotten a fever, boy?\u201d Old Huang touched his forehead and went on to say, \u201cEven people who have lived here for a century would not dare to rebel against a spirit. If you\u2019re suggesting this Han Sen would actually try to attack the shelter, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. This Han Sen\u2026 he\u2019s different.\u201d Little Zhao\u2019s excitement was difficult to contain.\n\nHan Sen traveled past the forest and equipped a black cloak. He was sneaking into Thunder Hell Shelter.\n\nThe Night Cloak truly was a treasure belonging to Night Empress. With it, Han Sen was able to sneak in without being noticed.\n\nHan Sen went towards the Thunder Garden he had been told about, completely invisible under the eye of the moon. That place was where the king spirits and super creatures lived. There was an abundance of healthy vegetation there.\n\nBefore he entered, Han Sen saw a giant beast atop the gate. It was fast asleep. Han Sen could immediately tell it was a super creature. Han Sen snuck inside without trouble, due to it not being able to notice him.\n\nAfter entering the garden, he saw another two super creatures. Again, without hassle, he was able to avoid them noticing his presence.\n\nThe Night Cloak was amazing, and Han Sen was able to avoid the detection of at least ten king spirits and ten super creatures.\n\n\u201cHe really is an emperor! There are so many super creatures and king class spirits here. If the emperor himself is going, there is no way I can repel the force he\u2019ll bring with him,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen suddenly heard two king spirits engage in conversation.\n\n\u201cIs Mister Thunder Hell going?\u201d a king spirit asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Mister Thunder Hell said that the king spirit there used to be incredibly powerful, and he wishes to claim him,\u201d the other king spirit answered.\n\nHan Sen was very happy to hear this. If Thunder Hell was confirmed to be going, an opportunity might arise.\n\nHan Sen could use the Night Cloak to sneak into the spirit hall. While the emperor was gone, he could nab the spirit stone and ruin everything the emperor sought to accomplish.\n\nHan Sen stayed there for a while longer, but he didn\u2019t hear anything else useful. It was going to be dawn soon, so he decided to leave before he risked being spotted. The Night Cloak was supremely effective at night, but it was useless during the daytime.\n\nHan Sen returned to the underground shelter and combined a sacred-blood thorn scorpion beast soul with the Invisible King Scorpion gem beast soul. Han Sen was going to use everything he could to bring down Thunder Hell Emperor, and he was going to do all he could to grab his spirit stone. He had no time find another scorpion beast soul for the gem, so that would have to do.\n\nAlthough Thunder Hell Emperor was leaving his shelter, he was sure to leave some guards behind to protect the spirit hall.\n\nAnd with the spirit halls always being bright, Han Sen knew he\u2019d have to fight his way in once he reached it."
