Why would he risk everything by using it to slay another demi-god, just so he could obtain another?\n\nJust like the jue Han Sen possessed, they weren\u2019t artifacts that boosted the abilities of a person in any way.\n\nDragon King and Yaksha, up to this point, had not spoken a single word concerning the betrayal. Although Dragon King had now stepped forward to elucidate a few minor details, the majority of the mystery Han Sen had long sought to uncover still remained fogged and unlearned.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mind was clogged with a number of questions, just as it always was. And he earnestly hoped Dragon King would be willing to give him the answer he wanted most.\n\nBut it seemed as if he had overstepped his own boundaries, because he had reeled back now and quit being so talkative.\n\nHe was Han Sen\u2019s servant now, though, so Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to stop prodding him for more answers. After learning the few tidbits he had, Han Sen was hungry for more. He decided to ask, \u201cHow did Asura manage to kill a demi-god? What did he get out of doing that?\u201d\n\nDragon King\u2019s lips trembled and tripped over each other, holding in words that weren\u2019t quite willing to part his vocal box. He looked away for a moment, as if to consider what exactly he should say. When he was ready, he turned back to look at Han Sen and said, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. The entire thing is like a feverish dream when I remember it now. Truth be told, we weren\u2019t entirely sure whether or not it was a demi-god we had actually killed.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t really sure what to make of that, so he pushed for more and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you summoned one? How can you not know you summoned a demi-god, when you went through the necessary steps for the summoning of a demi-god?\u201d\n\nDragon King was still remaining mum about the crux of the issue, skirting around the subject as best he could.\n\nHan Sen was worried Dragon King would buckle. It was obviously a difficult subject for him to talk about, and it was impressive he had given up as much as information as he had. Han Sen didn\u2019t want him retreating back into some sort of shell and refusing to say more.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cMister Ancient Devil used the core to summon a demi-god, but it was\u2026 weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was so strange about it?\u201d Han Sen enquired.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cMister Ancient Devil planned on summoning a weak demi-god. He could learn the strength of a demi-god by examining their altar before he committed to the summoning ritual.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had more than one Demi-God Geno Core, and eventually, he settled on one for the sacrifice. The altar, however, was so weak that it was unable to consume a super creature that was offered in sacrifice; alive, leastways. And this weakness was reflected in the demi-god himself, when he was fully summoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how weak demi-gods are, they must have a fitness of at least five thousand. That\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen had learned about demi-gods through the Ji family. The Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary\u2019s weakest creatures had a fitness level of five thousand, and that was the bare minimum. Survival in such a place, for any human, was a trial and a half.\n\nGrandpa Ji told Han Sen that even if he did manage to obtain a greater fitness number than five thousand, he should never underestimate the creatures and spirits of that place.\n\nEven if they were weak in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, they\u2019d be no laughing matter in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cHe was going to use our collective power and geno treasures to kill a demi-god. Even if we were unable to kill the demi-god we summoned, making it bleed and collecting its blood would make the venture worthwhile. After all, it was a being that inhabited the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary we were summoning, and it was only natural for us all to be afraid and nervous with the task at hand. But when that demi-god appeared before us, it was already on the precipice of death. Killing it would have been an easy job for any one of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, you guys were that lucky?\u201d Han Sen was surprised to hear they were that fortunate.\n\n\u201cLucky?\u201d Dragon King gave Han Sen a strange look before proceeding to say, \u201cNone of his plans were of any worth, so Asura stepped forth and killed it. Then, he took his power! It was like the savage twist of a knife, and suddenly, there was division in the ranks and contention amongst the generals. A fight broke out, and it resulted in the utter ruin of Ancient Devil Shelter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Asura did a good, old-fashioned kill steal. I don\u2019t really see what the big fuss is about. Couldn\u2019t you guys have just talked it out?\u201d Han Sen was a little underwhelmed, learning this was the answer to the mystery he had long wished to be revealed.\n\nDragon King looked at Han Sen strangely once more, and he told him, \u201cI said the demi-god looked weird, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, weird. As in, it\u2019s weird this emperor we summoned is dying weird, right?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been lucky if that had actually happened.\u201d Dragon King paused and sighed for a brief moment, before explaining, \u201cBefore the demi-god died, he said something that chilled our very bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, and what did he say?\u201d Han Sen asked. He wished Dragon King spoke a little faster, as it aggravated Han Sen when every word and syllable was delivered so slowly.\n\n\u201cHe said he was God.\u201d Dragon King\u2019s voice trembled to speak that final word.\n\n\u201cGod?!\u201d Han Sen had heard a lot about some figure proclaiming itself to be God, and he didn\u2019t think Dragon King was preaching about the Big Cheese of Christianity when saying this.\n\nIt sounded just like the God figure Han Jinzhi was said to have met."
