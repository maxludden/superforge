    "text": "Han Sen couldn\u2019t believe that the dragons soaring across the landscape were actually tree roots. They had the heads of dragons, the horns of dragons, the teeth of dragons, and the scales of dragons. They looked so alive, and they didn\u2019t look like plants at all.\n\nAs Han Sen watched them, a flock of birds landed on the back of one of the dragons. The dragon roared, shaking the creature\u2019s beard and exposing its rows of razor-sharp teeth. The dragon\u2019s roar was so loud that it shook the air, scattering all the birds. It really was a living, breathing dragon.\n\nBai Wei explained, \u201cThe King Tree grows on a landmass inside the King\u2019s Kingdom, and occasionally, parts of the tree spawn into king root dragons. The king air is hidden inside the king roots. To absorb the king air, you have to sit on one of those king dragons. Every king dragon is different, and each one provides access to a different type of king air. How much king air you can absorb also depends on how far away from the tree a particular dragon is. Sitting on a dragon close to the tree provides the most king air. The further away you are, the less you get.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Why is there no one else around?\u201d Han Sen nodded and looked around. He didn\u2019t see any of the Extreme King absorbing king air around them.\n\n\u201cWe are at the edge of King\u2019s Garden. These are the ends of the king roots, so the king air isn\u2019t strong here. Those of our race usually sit closer to the tree to absorb the most king air. This is our first time coming here, so let\u2019s find a king dragon here.\u201d After speaking, Bai Wei went towards a king dragon.\n\nThey were a few miles away from the nearest king dragon. As they approached, the king dragon roared at them, as if it was warning them to keep away.\n\nBai Wei and Han Sen ignored the warning, continuing toward the king dragon. The king dragon moved its massive body. It shook the mountain in an attempt to halt Bai Wei and Han Sen\u2019s approach.\n\nHan Sen noticed that he could only see half of the king dragon\u2019s body. The other half of the dragon was somewhere underground. It couldn\u2019t fly, so it just had to shake its body in an attempt to shoo them off.\n\nThe king dragon was powerful, but it couldn\u2019t release its power. Its body was restricted, as well. It had no chance of stopping Han Sen and Bai Wei. They landed easily atop its dragon horns.\n\nThe king dragon thrashed around for a while, but when its writhing failed to shake Han Sen and Bai Wei off, it eventually grew quiet and laid down again.\n\nHan Sen sat on the dragon\u2019s head, but he didn\u2019t feel any of the king air. He looked at Bai Wei.\n\nBai Wei smiled. \u201cYou will understand soon.\u201d\n\nHan Sen resigned himself to waiting. The king dragon here was at the periphery of the roots. There wasn\u2019t much king air, but the king dragon\u2019s power was too weak to touch them.\n\nAfter a while, the yellow leaves on the tree started to light up. The Kingese characters were shone gold as the King Tree lit with a holy light. It was like a godly tree that gave life to everything in its domain.\n\nAll of the dragons started to roar as they shifted and roused themselves. Before Han Sen could find out what was going on, the king dragon he was atop put its head into the ground.\n\nThe ground was like water as the king dragon sank into it. Han Sen and Bai Wei were still sitting atop the dragon\u2019s head, so they were carried underground as well.\n\nTheir subterranean surroundings should have been dark, but they could see a light as if it was glowing underwater. Something gold shone like a sun, but it was blurry and distant.\n\nThe King Dragon sat far away from that gold sun. It faced the gold sun, opened its dragon mouth, and spat out a dragon orb. The sun released golden light that shot into the dragon orb. The glow of the dragon orb increased.\n\nHan Sen was frozen. He was still wrapping his mind around the fact that they were underground.\n\n\u201cCome and absorb the king air. What are you waiting for?\u201d Bai Wei reminded Han Sen, as she cast a geno art.\n\nWhen Bai Wei cast her geno art, the golden sun released some gold light into her body. Her form was suddenly surrounded by a layer of golden holy light.\n\nHan Sen cast The Story of Genes to try to absorb that golden light. He felt something hot running into him, combining with his sense of being, but there wasn\u2019t much of it. Refining his Ghost Bone power would be faster.\n\nThe legs of a mosquito are still meat, and so Han Sen did his best to absorb as much of that golden light as possible. But after one hour, the king dragon retrieved its dragon orb. It roared and brought them back up to the surface.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough king air, and we have too little time to absorb it.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\n\u201cThis king dragon is part of the outer reaches of the king tree. To get closer to the king pulse and make it last longer, you must find a king dragon that is connected to the primary roots,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\n\u201cWell, what are we waiting for?\u201d Han Sen was dying to find a source of purer power.\n\n\u201cThe primary roots are usually taken. If we get close, we\u2019ll have to fight others for it.\u201d Bai Wei sighed.\n\n\u201cThere must be a few of them that arrive late,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBai Wei shook her head. \u201cIn here, power is the rule that governs everything. If you have the power, you can take over whatever you wish to. If you don\u2019t have power, you have to make use of an ordinary beard. You can do whatever you want, as long as you don\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat father you guys have isn\u2019t very caring. Doesn\u2019t he treat the daughters nicer?\u201d Han Sen looked depressed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bai Wei answered without a second thought.\n\n\u201cIn that case, we really will have to go and take what we want,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he walked deeper into the king tree.\n\nBai Wei said nothing, and she simply followed Han Sen.\n\nThey were both Dukes, and there were only two of them. Getting one of the primary roots would be next to impossible. After all, only King class elites took primary roots, and they always had a team of Royal Guards beside them. It would be difficult to fight people like that for a root.\n\nBai Wei wasn\u2019t planning on fighting, though. She wanted to try her luck and see if she could just find an unoccupied primary root.\n\nAfter all, the royal children weren\u2019t allowed to go there every day. And the Royal Guards had to be accompanied by royal children, so they couldn\u2019t go alone. So, if they were lucky, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find a primary root.\n\nThe closer to the King Tree they got, the scarier the king dragons became. Most king dragons were a dirty yellow color. It wasn\u2019t long before they encountered a king dragon that had gold scales. It was just resting on the ground.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the king dragon of a primary root!\u201d Bai Wei was ecstatic because no one else was making use of the gold dragon. It was obviously not taken.\n\nHan Sen and Bai Wei carefully sat down atop the gold king dragon. The gold king dragon was still asleep, though, and it didn\u2019t appear to have noticed their presence. The two of them just sat on its head.\n\n\u201cThese king dragons have just absorbed some king air. They won\u2019t go back into the ground for a while, so let\u2019s wait here.\u201d Bai Wei was in fine spirits, and she smiled at Han Sen."
