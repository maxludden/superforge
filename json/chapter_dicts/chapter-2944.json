    "text": "Suddenly, amidst the ruins, Han Sen found a very well-preserved statue. It was the statue of a ghost car.\n\nHan Sen pointed at the statue and asked, \u201cThis thing\u2026 Is it one of Sacred\u2019s holy beast Ghost Car?\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, this is the Ghost Car statue,\u201d Nine Thousand King quickly answered. \u201cThis statue is supposed to be in the center of the holy palace plaza. I do not know why it ended up out here.\u201d\n\nSob! Sob!\n\nIn the dark, the sound of a crying woman was heard again. It gave those who heard it a flare of goosebumps.\n\n\u201cNumber 9, do you know where the crying sound comes from?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown. On the road, he had heard a woman crying many times.\n\n\u201cMister, that crying sound comes from the space charm,\u201d Nine Thousand King answered. \u201cIt is the sound she makes when the space charm is hungry. The space charm must be looking for us. Since you have the lantern, Mister, she has not dared get too close.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of xenogeneic is space charm?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nNine Thousand King smiled and said, \u201cRegarding that, I have no idea. That thing only lives in the dark recesses of Sacred. It never gets close to the long, bright lanterns. Normal light can light up the darkness, but you cannot see space charm\u2019s body. All you will see is a shadow. It is like a fairy flying. You cannot see the details of its face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat being said, Mister, your stone lantern is very good. I have never heard of something being able to light up the darkness that wasn\u2019t one of those long, bright lanterns.\u201d Nine Thousand King carefully continued to keep licking Han Sen\u2019s boots. He wanted to find out where that stone lantern came from.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. He only continued to go forward while holding the stone lantern.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen saw a long, bright lantern up ahead. It was like a very big firefly, but there was still a distance between him and the light.\n\nHan Sen was happy. He hastened his passage to reach the light. Nine Thousand King made sure to swiftly follow.\n\nWhen they got close to the light, Han Sen saw a giant monument. Each side of it had a bright, long lantern. Those two long, bright lanterns were much bigger than the usual ones they had seen. They lit up several hundred feet around the area they were situated. They felt like shields of light against the dark.\n\nBefore the monument, Han Sen saw a few people were standing there. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster was there, as were three of the Extreme King deifieds. Aside from them, there was someone else. When Han Sen saw him, his body shivered and shook. It was the person from Sky Palace\u2019s first seat. Han Sen had seen him at the sanctuary\u2019s gate before.\n\nBack then, Sky Palace\u2019s first seat wanted to take Littleflower for a student in Sky Palace, but Han Sen was able to get away. Since then, Han Sen had not seen this person again.\n\nHan Sen had been to Sky Palace a few times since then, but he had never Sky Palace\u2019s first seat. He did not expect to find him, of all people, there.\n\nHan Sen wanted to hide his face, but it was already too late. Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, and the others were already looking in his direction.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Sky Palace\u2019s first seat knew Han Sen came from the sanctuaries. If he exposed his identity, that would not fare well for him.\n\nWhen Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others saw Han Sen and who he was with, they were shocked. They stared at Han Sen\u2019s stone lantern in awe. The stone lantern was similar to the long, bright lanterns that could light up Sacred. It even provided more room around it than the other lanterns, so they were shocked.\n\nThe first seat of Sky Palace looked surprised too. What surprised him the most was different from what surprised Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others.\n\nHan Sen led Nine Thousand King and the goldfish family toward the monument. He put away the lantern. He was going to say hello to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, but he shook his head and provided a wry smile instead. \u201cBrother Han, you should not get too close.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked with surprise.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster said, \u201cAlthough there are long, bright lanterns, this place is a trap. We are all trapped here, and we cannot get out.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell me sooner? What is the point of waiting for me to get this close before telling me?\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster was not really a friend, so he had no reason to warn Han Sen at all. Han Sen had not really expected that he would. He just coldly asked, \u201cIf it can trap you, a grandmaster, what amazing thing is this?\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster pointed at the monument. \u201cOnce you look at the monument, you will understand.\u201d\n\nHan Sen turned his head and looked at the monument. When he looked at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat\u2019s face, he stared at him like his eyes were on fire. Yet, he didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nHan Sen looked at the monument. He saw two big words on the monument.\n\n\u201cFate Monument.\u201d Han Sen read the two words on the monument, but he did not understand why they were trapped there.\n\nWhen Ancient Abyss Grandmaster saw Han Sen\u2019s face, he knew that Han Sen did not know what the Fate Monument was. He quickly said, \u201cFate Monument is Holy Kirin from the four holy beast\u2019s talent gene treasure. This monument can decide your fate. The Holy Kirin used his treasure. Not a single person in the universe could beat him. The monument ended up here. Although the Holy Kirin does not control it, the power of fate is still within it. If you enter the radius of the fate monument, you will be affected by it. Your life will be frozen in this place. If you stay away from the Fate Monument, your life will be gone, and you will die with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs such a thing possible?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Fate Monument in shock.\n\n\u201cYes, it is, Mister Nine Thousand King politely said to Han Sen. \u201cIf you look at the back of the Fate Monument, you will see your fate.\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster and the others were shocked. Nine Thousand King was accompanying Han Sen. It was something they were already surprised about. After hearing the way Nine Thousand King was talking to Han Sen, it was like he had become a servant or something.\n\nNine Thousand King was leading the way. Han Sen led the goldfish family behind the fate monument. An Extreme King deified elite quietly said to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, \u201cIt looks like Nine Thousand King is with Han Sen. This is unbelievable. How can Han Sen claim such an old monster?\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss shook his head but did not speak. When Sky Palace\u2019s first seat heard what was said, his frown tightened.\n\n\u201cThis kid is the person I saw at the sanctuary gate. Even if he did come to the universe from the sanctuaries, he could not achieve much with the power he had. It was not that many years ago, yet he is already deified. He can also tame the old monster Nine Thousand King. In the years I have been trapped here, what has happened?\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat weirdly looked at Han Sen."
