    "text": "When Han Sen arrived at Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s office, the Knight King and Mister White were already there. They both looked at Han Sen with strange intensity as he entered.\n\n\u201cAhem\u2026 Mister Knight King. Is there something you require of me?\u201d Han Sen asked with a cough.\n\nIce Blue Knight King squinted while he looked at Han Sen. \u201cKid, you are good. You are just like me in the days of my youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister Knight King, what is that supposed to mean?\u201d Han Sen looked at Ice Blue Knight with a modicum of confusion.\n\nIce Blue Knight King handed Han Sen a form with a blank space for his signature. \u201cQueen Bai Wei would like to invite you to go to the Extreme King homeworlds with her. The request has been approved. If you sign this, you can leave with Queen Bai Wei.\u201d\n\nAfter giving Han Sen a quick rundown on the relevant details of the trip, Ice Blue Knight King smiled and said, \u201cYou are good. It only took you a few days to attract the desire of the arrogant little Queen Bai Wei. She is a uniquely talented girl. Many nobles of the Extreme King wish to marry her, but she has rejected the advances of every one of them. I sure didn\u2019t see this coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou misunderstand. I think Queen Bai Wei only admires my power.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t really agree with Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s description of her talents.\n\nBut still, Bai Wei was strong. Her body wasn\u2019t any weaker than Han Sen\u2019s, and she was a top Marquise by all accounts and measurements. It was an exaggeration to say she was \u201cuniquely talented,\u201d though. Lone Bamboo\u2019s fitness was just as strong as Bai Wei\u2019s, and it\u2019d be fair to say he was more skilled.\n\nIt seemed that Mister White could see right through Han Sen, though. The man smiled and said, \u201cYou might not have heard this, but there is something special about the Extreme King. Being accepted amongst the three highest races has its perks. Right now, Queen Bai Wei is top class. She might not be the strongest in the universe, but if she becomes King class and activates her King body, killing a half-deified enemy won\u2019t be a difficult task for someone like her. She might even be able to hold her own against a fully deified opponent.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing body?\u201d Han Sen looked at Mister White with shock.\n\n\u201cThat is no secret. Although the Extreme King may not be born deified like those of the Ancient God, we have King bodies. As long as we achieve King class, we can activate King bodies. That power makes us stronger than those of the same level. That being said, it does cost a lot of energy, and it cannot be used infinitely. Still, it is quite powerful. Plus, once we become deified, the King body can give us a boost. That makes a deified Extreme King stronger than the average deified.\u201d\n\nMister White paused briefly, then resumed by saying, \u201cIt has been discovered that Queen Bai Wei possesses a very brilliant King body. She is one of the most gifted you can find amongst the Extreme King. If she becomes King class, she can become deified.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that great?\u201d Han Sen was surprised. Mister White seemed quite willing to discuss the subject in depth.\n\nIce Blue Knight King looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cMister White has spoken a great deal to you, so you should understand our situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand. I will stay away from her.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\nWith talent like Bai Wei\u2019s, she would be very important to the future of the Extreme King, and her marriage would be a very complicated political matter.\n\nThe two men before Han Sen were giving him a warning. They didn\u2019t want him chasing after Bai Wei.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think too much. We might be going overboard. Just be yourself and don\u2019t disobey her. Being Queen Bai Wei\u2019s loyal guard is an important posting. You will benefit greatly from that position.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King smiled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like leaving so soon. Please let me stay in the Ice Blue System for a while.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t interested in selling himself off to the Extreme King.\n\nHan Sen had little interest in being a loyal guard, and he hadn\u2019t yet discovered how to use the plate. He hadn\u2019t tracked down what Night River King had discovered out at the border of the Ice Blue System, either. He didn\u2019t want to leave with so many loose ends.\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be possible. This transfer order is coming straight from King Bai. You and your team have to go to the Extreme King homeworld with Queen Bai Wei,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said.\n\n\u201cShe said she was here as punishment, and she is going back so soon?\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cAfter what happened with Night River King, King Bai doesn\u2019t believe she is safe here. So, she is being forced to return,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cReturn to your rooms and ready yourself. In two days, I will be escorting you to the Extreme King to be sure that nothing else happens to you.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King then waved his hand in dismissal.\n\nHan Sen had to leave Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s office. As he walked, he thought to himself, \u201cDid King Bai find out that I took the Undying Bird Nest? Is that why he\u2019s actually summoning me?\u201d\n\nIt had been two weeks, and the little red bird had remained quietly in the nest the entire time. Han Sen had put other bird eggs inside, and within two hours, they hatched. That meant the nest still had its powers. He just didn\u2019t know why the little red bird was taking so long to hatch.\n\n\u201cI hope the little red bird hatches before I journey to the Extreme King. If the Undying Bird Nest is taken by King Bai, I\u2019ll have no chance.\u201d\n\nBack in his rooms, Han Sen explained his situation to Han Yan and his companions. They prepared to go to the Extreme King in a few short days.\n\nEdward heard the news, and it made him frown.\n\n\u201cIf Han Sen goes to the homeworld, we\u2019ll lose our chance to get our hands on the item.\u201d As the Ice Blue Knight spoke, his expression turned pensive.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow him to go to the Extreme King. He has to stay here,\u201d Edward said.\n\n\u201cHow do we make him stay? After the incident with Night River King, Ice Blue Knight King himself is going to escort Han Sen to the Extreme King. We wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. You want to take on people loyal to Ice Blue Knight King? We aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Edward suddenly had a thought. \u201cThe only way is to cooperate with Ice Blue Knight King.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight jumped out of his chair, staring at Edward with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell Ice Blue Knight King that Han Sen took the relic?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Edward nodded.\n\n\u201cNo, no way!\u201d the Ice Blue Knight shouted.\n\n\u201cIt is the only way. That is how we keep Han Sen and the item,\u201d Edward stated coldly.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Before the Ice Blue Knight finished, Edward interrupted.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018but.\u2019 This is the only way.\u201d Edward squinted in thought. \u201cDo not forget that Ice Blue Knight King doesn\u2019t know about the relic.\u201d\n\nThe Ice Blue Knight was shocked. He sat down and forcibly calmed himself, then said, \u201cYou mean we are going to tell Ice Blue Knight King that Han Sen has a relic, but we won\u2019t tell him what it is?\u201d"
