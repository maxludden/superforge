    "text": "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to offend people, so you want me to do it for you? You are quite smart,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said to Han Sen with a smile.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t explained his true purpose, but Sky Palace Leader immediately recognized what he was doing.\n\n\u201cSky Palace Leader is so smart. I want to do everything I can for Sky Palace, but sadly, my body is unable to keep up. I cannot bless a student every day.\u201d Han Sen feigned complete sincerity. He looked as if he wanted nothing more than to serve Sky Palace Leader.\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll be the bad guy, but in return, you will have to do something for me,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said to Han Sen with a smile.\n\n\u201cOld Fox,\u201d Han Sen muttered to himself. He had expected that if he agreed to give out blessings, he would receive something valuable in return. But it now looked as if he wouldn\u2019t earn anything extra, and he would have to do an additional task on the leader\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cYou can ask me to do anything, Sky Palace Leader. Even if it means I will end up destroyed and dead, I will do my best in such a task. I would never ask for anything in return.\u201d Han Sen lowered his head and bowed.\n\n\u201cIs that so? You really won\u2019t try to take advantage of the situation?\u201d If Han Sen hadn\u2019t said the last few words, Sky Palace Leader would have probably believed him. However, it was obvious from what Han Sen said that he had been looking for some goodies.\n\n\u201cIf you are willing to do this, I will deal with all the people who come to seek your blessing. You can decide when you want to bless them, or if you want to at all. But if you can do this well, I will still reward you,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said dispassionately. \u201cWhat is it that you want me to do?\u201d Han Sen had started to grow worried as Sky Palace Leader spoke.\n\nIf Sky Palace Leader was establishing terms like this, whatever task he wanted to give Han Sen had to be complicated.\n\n\u201cGo to the Very High,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said simply.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Sky Palace Leader with confusion. He remembered Sky Palace Leader saying that he didn\u2019t want Han Sen to go to the Very High.\n\nSky Palace Leader smiled and said, \u201cWe need a spy amongst them. I think you are up to the task, too.\u201d\n\nHan Sen almost thought his ears were broken. Going to the Very High as a spy? Han Sen couldn\u2019t think of anything that posed a greater risk.\n\nThe Very High could see into a person\u2019s mind. If he was attempting to steal their secrets, it would only take them a split second to discover that. Espionage among the Very High would be suicide.\n\nIf anyone other than Sky Palace Leader had suggested this, Han Sen would have assumed that they were simply an idiot. The idea seemed like either pure stupidity or an elaborate way of getting himself killed.\n\nSky Palace Leader knew what Han Sen was thinking, and so he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If I let you go, I have a way to safeguard your mind that will keep them from peering into it. You are no good to me dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why would you even want me to go and spy on the Very High?\u201d Han Sen asked carefully.\n\nIf he was even going to consider doing this, he had to know more. He needed the details because going to the Very High for ulterior motives was a very dangerous game to play.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to me. I need you to find someone within the Very High. If you hear news of this person, you need to relay it back to me. You don\u2019t have to do anything more dangerous than that,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good at looking for people, and I\u2019m not very skilled at socializing. I\u2019m afraid I might fail your task.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want to go, so this was his way of rejecting the offer.\n\nSky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and coldly said, \u201cWhen you finished this mission, I planned to give you the Constellation Sea for you and your family. It looks like you aren\u2019t interested, though. So, never mind. It is fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader, the Constellation Sea you reference: is it the xenogeneic space outside the Shining Star System?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide as he asked Sky Palace Leader.\n\nThe Constellation Sea was a xenogeneic space that had been discovered some time ago. It was in a part of the universe that belonged to Sky Palace. It was practically in Sky Palace\u2019s backyard, so the only way to enter it was through Sky Palace.\n\nThe Constellation Sea was connected to the Shining Star System and an underdeveloped, barren system. It was a very unique place, and it showed great promise if anyone ever developed it. Plus, the Constellation Sea was very rich in resources and raw materials. Many elders within Sky Palace wished to take control of the Constellation Sea, and they had begun to fight over it. But because the fights had grown too violent, Sky Palace Leader decided to seal up the Constellation Sea and not give it to anyone.\n\nNow, Sky Palace Leader said he was going to open up the Constellation Sea exclusively for Han Sen. He could build a family there. He wouldn\u2019t just be permitted to use it; the leader was going to let Han Sen govern the Constellation Sea. It would become Han Sen\u2019s territory. If he wanted to, it might even be possible to build a human empire there. Other factions wouldn\u2019t be able to meddle or interfere in Han Sen\u2019s affairs.\n\nUnless Han Sen opened the Constellation Sea\u2019s borders to travel, no one would be able to wander in. Plus, the Constellation Sea still had Sky Palace as a shield. It wouldn\u2019t end up besieged unless the whole of Sky Palace fell first.\n\n\u201cGood memory. It is the Constellation Sea near the Shining Star System, yes,\u201d Sky Palace Leader answered.Han Sen\u2019s eyes narrowed in thought. Sky Palace Leader was offering him a ludicrously valuable reward. But that suggested the task wouldn\u2019t be simple. Simply relaying information wouldn\u2019t be hard, and if Han Sen could truly be taught to protect his mind, the danger level didn\u2019t warrant such a reward. Why would Sky Palace Leader be willing to give him something so precious for fulfilling a task that was so easy?\n\n\u201cMay I ask what kind of person you are looking for?\u201d Han Sen asked with hesitation. The Constellation Sea was a good place. He wanted it, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy owning it if he died at the hands of the Very High.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Very High woman. I don\u2019t know her name, and I\u2019m afraid her appearance might have changed from what I remember,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cNo name? No appearance? How am I supposed to find someone like that?\u201d Han Sen was shocked to hear that.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There is a way to find her. Otherwise, why would I ask you to look for her?\u201d Sky Palace Leader paused. Then, he said seriously, \u201cThere is a birthmark on her chest that looks like a red heart. You will be able to see it. It is very obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer chest has a birthmark that resembles a red heart? That is quite obvious, you would think\u2026 Wait\u2026 Chest\u2026\u201d Han Sen glanced down at his own chest. He looked strange as he asked Sky Palace Leader, \u201cYou say you are looking for a Very High woman?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said with a nod of his head.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll have the chance to check out the chests of various women for that birthmark?\u201d Han Sen felt that Sky Palace Leader might be tricking him. If he went to the Very High just to check out their women, it would be a f*cking deathwish.\n\n\u201cIf it was an easy task, why would I give you the Constellation Sea?\u201d Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to look at them yourself, anyway. You can just ask around. Exquisite is a woman, for instance. She is more likely to have seen it. And if you can get her to tell you, then you will have no trouble. Come back in four years, and you can take your family to the Constellation Sea. I will give you all the support you can ask for. I will give you people, if you want. Do you want a boat? I can give you a boat. You won\u2019t have to pay taxes for three hundred years, either.\u201d"
