    "text": "Han Sen was believed to have obtained his Teeth Knife knifemind in one and a half months. What\u2019s more, his knifemind was very close to the proficiency that only a King could demonstrate. It dazed the Narrow Moon elites into a state of disbelief.\n\nThey had seen this with their own eyes, though. And so they couldn\u2019t actually doubt it.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t claim that Han Sen was cheating, either. Yisha was the only other that could practice Teeth Knife in such a fashion. Even if Yisha was helping Han Sen cheat somehow, there was no way Han Sen should have been able to earn such a knifemind in such a short time.\n\nPeople were worried, though. And no one could doubt Han Sen\u2019s talent.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s performance with the red mist spring was shocking. Many members of Moon Garden, such as Rebecca and Du Lishe, now greatly feared Han Sen.\n\nThe day after the events of the red mist spring, Yisha gave Han Sen a call. She didn\u2019t say much, but she provided him with a geno art to practice with.\n\nYou performed well. This geno art is your reward. But you cannot be cocky about it. You need to remember that if you do not obtain deified status, it will be useless. Your strength won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nShe gave him some Viscount geno fluid, too, so he could practice.\n\nHan Sen did not understand what Yisha meant by this. But he was relieved that Yisha had protected him, indicating that things were okay between them.\n\nNot long after, Moon Garden invited Han Sen to become a member, but Yisha rejected it on his behalf. Yisha had wanted Han Sen to join Moon Garden to gain support from the tribe, but she changed her mind after all that had happened. She didn\u2019t want him joining them.\n\nBecause of this, the Kings at Narrow Moon held another meeting. They tried to convince Yisha to allow Han Sen to become a member of Moon Garden. Her response was cold. \u201cMy student is not any boy you can push around however you wish.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she left. She didn\u2019t save face for Moon Wheel King, either.\n\nMoon Wheel King and the others wanted Han Sen to join simply because Han Sen\u2019s talents were too shocking. His mind far exceeded the capabilities of others at the same level. If he could join Moon Garden and practice with the members there, the others should also benefit and become stronger.\n\nYisha was no longer interested in this arrangement, though. And it wasn\u2019t as if they could force Han Sen to take part in Moon Garden.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen was in his room, playing with the Jade Turtle Spell. Normally, it was a one-time use item. It wouldn\u2019t come off after being used. Instead, its power would be exhausted after a day and the entire thing would shatter.\n\nWhen Han Sen returned to base, his body felt awful under the weight of the Jade Turtle Spell. He tried to pull it off, but alas, he was unable to. Since he couldn\u2019t use super king spirit mode, he ended up trying the Dongxuan Sutra. He spread its influence into the Jade Turtle Spell, then simulated its powers and removed it from himself.\n\nThe power of the Jade Turtle Spell was very deep. Han Sen only simulated a tiny part of it, but he was able to learn a lot. It also made him wonder where it had come from.\n\nDue to the power being too deep and profound, Han Sen was unable to learn it all. So, he began fiddling with the thing using the Dongxuan Aura to slowly learn more about it.\n\nThe geno art Yisha had given Han Sen was a light-based art called Moon. As he practiced it, he found that it fit him quite well.\n\nMoon was fairly amazing, as well. It could use the powers of light to generate a moon of his own. The power was something like the ability of an Earl to generate a spirit that wasn\u2019t actually a real spirit.\n\nHan Sen was quite interested in this geno art. And since it was Yisha who had allowed him to practice it, he didn\u2019t dare be lazy with the gift. He practiced with it whenever he was able to.\n\nThe biggest reward he had received from the events at the red mist spring was his Spell evolving. Quite surprisingly, the Viscount class Spell was able to unleash light powers of its own. Furthermore, it possessed a third form.\n\nGeno armaments had two forms, traditionally. One was the plain armorset form that was always there for him to equip.\n\nThe second form came from reaching the second stage of evolution. In Han Sen\u2019s case, it was a lady form; the gunner called Spell. Xie Qing King\u2019s book and Wang Yuhang\u2019s bike were the second forms, too.\n\nVery few, if any, had heard of there being a third possible form. Han Sen knew very little about geno armaments, though, so he wasn\u2019t sure if it was how uncommon it truly was. Regardless, this was the first time he had seen or heard of such a thing.\n\nSpell\u2019s third form was that of a sniper rifle. Han Sen tried out the rifle and found it surprisingly easy to get headshots from a distance of a hundred miles.\n\nThe biggest advantage of having a sniper rifle was that Han Sen\u2019s power was concentrated into bullets. Future engagements wouldn\u2019t be so costly, either, with the range of the weapon.\n\nThe normal power of a Viscount came from swordlights or knifelights. It was very lucky if you could cast such strikes over a distance of a few hundred meters.\n\nBut with that sniper rifle, Han Sen could guarantee headshots without his targets being aware of his presence. It was a perfect weapon for assassinations.\n\nThe only limitation was that the bullet velocity depended on Spell\u2019s power and Han Sen\u2019s own power. But that still meant that the stronger they grew, the stronger the bullets would become. He just couldn\u2019t use other sources of power to fuel it.\n\nAll in all, Han Sen loved it. He could level up quite easily with the rifle, and headshots would not be difficult to get.\n\nTzi! Tzi!\n\nHan Sen was playing with the Jade Turtle Spell, and as he did, something moved in his pocket. It made a sound.\n\nHan Sen opened his pocket and saw the red mist orb inside. The seven minks were reemerging from the orb.\n\nWhen they saw Han Sen, they opened their eyes and began crooning at him.\n\n\u201cAre you guys hungry?\u201d Han Sen thought he understood what they were implying.\n\nThe little minks in Han Sen\u2019s pocket nodded.\n\nSo, Han Sen fed them some xenogeneic meat. During the Red Mist Valley incident, the Viscounts had killed many creatures for him. He moved the flesh back to the base, and there was a lot. Because of this, he didn\u2019t mind feeding the little creatures.\n\nThe seven minks munched on the flesh, and while they were eating, Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan their bodies and observe their energy flow.\n\nAfter watching them for a while, something gave him a shock. The minks really were just Baron class, but their energy flows were complex. They were unlike any other Baron he had seen before."
