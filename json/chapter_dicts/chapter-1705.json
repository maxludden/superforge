    "text": "When Han Sen first saw the Nine-Life Cat symbol on Zero, he thought it was just a sign associating her with Blood Legion in some way. Now that Han Sen was thinking about it, he realized the symbol was just like the tattoo on his back.\n\nZero could enter the sanctuaries without issue, unlike others who were subject to limitations and restrictions. She never had to go through a formal ascension process, either.\n\nNow Han Sen was thinking that if Zero had a Nine-Life Cat symbol like his, the mystery was practically resolved.\n\nOld Cat had said that having Nine-Life Cat blood meant you could come and go in any sanctuary as you pleased. It was a fine explanation for why Zero was able to enter any of the sanctuaries, without ascending the proper way.\n\nAnd Zero teleported to Han Sen whenever or wherever he ended up. That was something else that went against the pre- established system of the sanctuaries. That was similar to what had happened to Han Sen when he ended up next to Old Cat.\n\nIf Zero\u2019s tattoo was the same as his, that meant they shared a weird connection of some kind. They might have been one- and-the-same, and that was why Zero would always spawn next to him.\n\nHan Sen thought this was very possible. He\u2019d only ever had one brief look at her Nine-Life Cat tattoo, though, so he couldn\u2019t quite remember the details. He didn\u2019t know if it was exactly the same one that was on his back.\n\nSeeing Zero, who was currently treating his wounds, he thought to himself, \u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman. I can\u2019t ask her to take her clothes off so I can inspect her.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought about this conundrum for a while, but he couldn\u2019t come up with an excuse that would permit him to get a look at her tattoos.\n\n\u201cZero, you haven\u2019t bought any new clothes in a long time. How about we go and get you some later?\u201d Han Sen looked at Zero\u2019s clothes. He only had to make her wear something that revealed her back, and he would see the tattoo.\n\n\u201cNo, I have enough,\u201d Zero said calmly.\n\n\u201cBut I need to. You are a beautiful girl and you need to dress up pretty. If you don\u2019t, people will find out I\u2019ve been cheap on you. I will handle this for you, okay?\u201d Han Sen said that all at once, not giving her another chance to respond.\n\nZero did not say anything, either. Once she had dealt with Han Sen\u2019s wounds, she left.\n\nHan Sen was on the sofa browsing Skynet. He bought a few different garments for Zero.\n\nHe bought a number of different clothes to hide the ones he truly wanted her to wear~the ones that would display her back.\n\nOf course, he wasn\u2019t dumb enough to buy a lot of different clothing that all showed her back. That would be too obvious, and it\u2019d be like he was making a statement. By buying a bunch of different styles, she\u2019d be none the wiser.\n\nTwo days later, the clothes were delivered by a drone. Han Sen called Zero over and convinced her to try them on, one by one.\n\nAnd when Zero wore the clothes that revealed her back, Han Sen was delivered quite the surprise.\n\nZero\u2019s appearance hadn\u2019t changed much, but she had grown up a lot. She was a woman now. She looked very beautiful in the dress he got her, and Han Sen couldn\u2019t stop admiring her looks.\n\nZero walked around, with Han Sen staring keenly at her back. He also took a photo, for future investigation.\n\nBut when he saw her back, he really could see that the Nine-Life Cat tattoo was the same as the one he had. It wasn\u2019t just the shape that was a carbon copy, either; he could sense it was the same via its color and feel.\n\n\u201cI was right! If Zero\u2019s back tattoo is the same as the Nine-Life Cat pendant, it explains everything. But why would Zero have it and the pendant? Blood Legion had two of those relics? Where did Zero come from? Is she a human or a shura? Or is she something else entirely?\u201d After Han Sen discovered this, his mind found more questions than answers.\n\nHan Sen believed Zero might be a human that had used a geno fluid at the shura grave. It was certainly a possibility, but the tattoo posed other problems.\n\nWhen Han Sen became a god, he had absorbed the Nine-Life Cat. When had Zero combined with the necklace? And how had she done it so soon when she wasn\u2019t strong?\n\n\u201cDear, what do you want for dinner tonight? Because you are injured, I will cook.\u201d Ji Yanran pushed the door open and walked right in. She was shocked by the scene she was witnessing.\n\nHan Sen was lounging on the sofa, staring at a loosely clothed Zero. The dress she wore left her whole back on display.\n\nHan Sen wished to give her an answer, but he immediately noticed a dangerous look take over her face. He quickly told her, \u201cZero bought a number of different pieces of clothing, and she wished to ask me which looked the best!\u201d\n\n\u201cZero, you bought these clothes?\u201d Ji Yanran nibbled her lips and asked Zero directly.\n\n\u201cHan Sen bought them. Told me to wear them.\u201d Zero wasn\u2019t a liar and her EQ was low. She wasn\u2019t really sure what was going on, so she simply answered with honesty.\n\nJi Yanran squinted her eyes and looked down at Han Sen with a look that was more frightening than hell\u2019s most rotten demon. She slowly approached him.\n\n\u201cLet me explain! It isn\u2019t what you think. This is all a misunderstanding!\u201d Han Sen wished to explain.\n\nJi Yanran walked in front of Han Sen and then smiled a smile that was creepier than the officer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou love to watch girls change their clothes? I will show you how it\u2019s done right when we go home.\u201d The smile remained fixed on Ji Yanran\u2019s face, and it gave Han Sen a horrible chill.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the mall and buy the most expensive garment. Then, you can dress yourself up in it and show me!\u201d Han Sen quickly said.\n\n\u201cShut up and get in here!\u201d Ji Yanran grabbed Han Sen by the ear and pulled him into the next room. Many screams were heard after that.\n\nA while later, Han Sen managed to explain everything clearly. He desperately wanted to escape the wrath of her finger.\n\nAfter dinner was done, Han Sen saw Stay Up Late up in the observation tower. He walked over and started to chat with him. \u201cThis matter concerns our lives. Is there something you need to tell me?\u201d\n\nStay Up Late was more injured than Han Sen was. He was reclining on a sofa with a hot cup of tea. He stared up at the sky as he replied. \u201cThat was the Third Division Special Forces officer. He trained all its members, myself included.\u201d\n\nStay Up Late sounded okay, just a little cold. Still, it was a soothing voice to listen to. But what he said next shocked Han Sen."
