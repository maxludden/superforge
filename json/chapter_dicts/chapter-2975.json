    "text": "Yet, Human King knew about Littleflower, and he knew a lot about him. Nine-Life Cat represented Blood Legion and was a mascot for them. It made Han Sen start to think of many things.\n\nHuman King weirdly looked at Han Sen asked, \u201cDo you want to know about the relationship between me and Old Cat?\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded but did not say anything.\n\nHuman King laughed to himself. \u201cTo be honest with you, I am just like you. We are the failures that were abandoned by Old Cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not understand what you mean,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cOld Cat was the guardian of the sanctuaries,\u201d Human King coldly said. \u201cWithout his help, do you think the crystallizers would have been able to hide in the sanctuaries for good? I even wondered that. With the crystallizers sharing Qin Xiu\u2019s blood and escaping to the sanctuaries to do all kinds of research, everything that happened involved Old Cat and Qin Xiu. Perhaps it was Qin Xiu who was trying to find his heir.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Human King looked at Han Sen. He went on to say, \u201cYou and I are the failures Old Cat has been watching over the years. He gave up. Only your son Littleflower was approved by Old Cat. He became Qin Xiu\u2019s heir.\u201d\n\nHan Sen now understood what Human King meant. Simply said, Human King was just like him. They had Old Cat\u2019s help and attention, but they were not selected by him.\n\nHuman King squinted his eyes as he peered at Han Sen. It looked like he was smiling, but he was not smiling. \u201cYou should not think that being an ancestor of Qin Xiu is a good thing. It is actually the opposite. If Qin Xiu dared to choose my son as an ancestor, I would do all in my power to rip him apart and destroy all that remained of his petty factions.\u201d\n\nWhat Human King said was something Han Sen was in total agreement with, but he still wanted to know why Human King felt that way. Therefore, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took my son and sent my son to die,\u201d Human King coldly said. \u201cThat is enough of a reason for me to kill his entire family 10,000 times over.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying Qin Xiu\u2019s plan would not work?\u201d Han Sen quietly asked. He understood what that meant.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeded, Sacred would not be what it is today.\u201d Human King looked at Han Sen. \u201cDon\u2019t you have the holy spirit of that Kirin Qin Xiu made? What do you think of that Kirin\u2019s holy spirit power?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very strong,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Human King\u2019s smile grew deeper. \u201cYou should use that holy Kirin spirit that you said is very strong to strike me as hard as you can. I want to see how strong Qin Xiu\u2019s stuff is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, if you don\u2019t mind that.\u201d Han Sen pulled out his cause karma knife and summoned the holy Kirin\u2019s holy spirit on it.\n\nThe Kirin\u2019s holy spirit possessed a blade. It was possible for it to be anything, as long as it was a weapon.\n\nHan Sen wanted to know how strong Human King was, so he was not going to deny Human King\u2019s request. He also knew Human King had suggested this as a way for him to gauge Han Sen\u2019s strength. So, there was no use denying him.\n\nHan Sen looked at Human King. The holy light on the blade was strong. It was like a demon flame that flickered.\n\nHuman King was still sitting on the throne. He observed Han Sen and his knife with interest.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry\u2026\u201d Han Sen slashed Human King like mad. The knife light was like some laser that could split a world. It came right before Human King.\n\nDing!\n\nHuman King did not move. Even his face remained the same. He continued to sit where he was. Somehow, his hand appeared beneath the knife. His middle finger and index finger captured Han Sen\u2019s cause karma knife. That scary knife light was immediately broken by his very powerful fingers.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s expression changed. Although he had not used all of his strength with that slash, it was still at about 70%. Despite that, the holy Kirin\u2019s scary power was able to kill a top-class true god xenogeneic. It could not, however, beat Human King\u2019s two fingers.\n\nHuman King let his fingers go and looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou are being too polite. If it was me, I would strike as hard as I could.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen was able to say anything, Human King asked, \u201cWhat do you think of my power?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strong.\u201d Han Sen used only those words to describe it because he could not yet gauge just how strong he was.\n\n\u201cMy power is still not as strong as Qin Xiu. Considering the thing Qin Xiu wanted to do back then, do you think this holy spirit, which Qin Xiu himself did not know if it was a success or not, was something he could do? In the end, the heir he selected was just a test. They were lab rats whose sole purpose was for testing.\u201d Human King spoke with a look of disdain.\n\n\u201cHang on\u2026 Why is your power\u2026\u201d Han Sen felt Human King\u2019s power was better than most people at true god class. He felt as if he was no weaker than Moment God.\n\n\u201cWhy are my powers stronger than a true god?\u201d Human King laughed and looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou should know the answer. Because Qin Xiu had blue blood genes, for humans to be better than a sky full of races, you need what it takes to battle God Spirits. If you are willing to, I can make you a member of the blue bloods. For you, it means you can become stronger. You would be much stronger than you are now. You might end up as strong as Qin Xiu was back then.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not speak. He silently rejected Human King\u2019s offer. That offer seemed tempting, but there were many things he wished to figure out first.\n\nIf blue-blood genes were that powerful, Qin Xiu would not lose.\n\nThinking about that from a different perspective, if Qin Xiu thought his blood could overcome God Spirits, why did he not seek to continue his bloodline?\n\nEven if he could not make babies, with Sacred\u2019s technology, they could copy the genes of Qin Xiu. That would not have been difficult to do.\n\nYet, Qin Xiu had not done that, and there had to be a reason for it.\n\n\u201cTelling me all these secrets cannot be the sole purpose for seeking me out. What do you want me to do for you?\u201d Han Sen still had not figured out why Human King had called him there.\n\n\u201cYou do not have to do anything for me,\u201d Human King coldly said. \u201cYou are human. Your sons and daughters are humans. So, my child, no matter whether you are willing to or not, you and I will be the same. Go against the God Spirits and do whatever you think it is we must do. There is no need for me to request anything.\u201d\n\nHan Sen still did not understand. Due to the fact Qin Xiu wanted to destroy god palaces and kill God Spirits, the God Spirits wanted to erase Qin Xiu\u2019s bloodline.\n\nThat logic seemed to make sense, but Han Sen thought there was a problem somewhere. He just couldn\u2019t figure out what the problem was.\n\n\u201cI asked you here to remind you, my child, that you cannot trust Qin Xiu. You cannot rely on the relics of his past. Maintain your crystallizer identity. No matter what happens, tell no one about your true identity. You need to do that to live longer and have more chances.\u201d Human King looked serious."
