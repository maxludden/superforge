    "text": "Han Sen was in Super God Spirit mode. That scary power went through his semi-transparent body and did not do anything to him.\n\nHan Sen was holding the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. He teleported in front of Kill Sky God and struck his head again. He had to act very quickly since Wan\u2019er would not last long\n\nDong!\n\nThe Sky Vine Radish God Lance carried the power of Super Spank and struck Kill Sky God\u2019s neck. The tip of the lance plunged into his muscles and dug in a few inches before it was unable to go any further.\n\nHan Sen had selected a location that had no armor for protection. If he struck the armor, the result would have likely been unfavorable.\n\nKill Sky God\u2019s eyes flickered with god light, but he could not dodge Han Sen\u2019s strike. The god hammer in his hand kept on swinging. Against the Super God Spirit body, it was useless.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Sky Vine Radish God Lance kept on attacking. It hit the same wound that had already been inflicted upon Kill Sky God. He wanted to continuously strike the same spot and sever his neck.\n\nHan Sen quickly discovered that the speed of his wound ripping was not as fast as Kill Sky God\u2019s wound healing. His repeated attacks did not accomplish much. Before the second lance reached that spot, Kill Sky God\u2019s wound released some god light and was almost healed.\n\n\u201cMy power really isn\u2019t enough to kill an Annihilation class God Spirit.\u201d Han Sen frowned. He was in a bit of a rush.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Tower Wan\u2019er was getting worse. She was almost going to wake up. The only thing that made Han Sen happy was the fact that Destiny\u2019s Tower was being shaken by Kill Sky God\u2019s scary power and wasn\u2019t breaking. It did not even get damaged. It was just the power that made it keep bouncing around everywhere. It was moving further away from the battleground. Moaning sounds were heard from someplace within the tower. It sounded as if it was going to crack any second. It was uncertain how long it would last.\n\n\u201cIf I had not borrowed a body and pushed my power to the max by using the strongest god skill, you would have been killed by now already!\u201d Kill Sky God looked at Han Sen coldly. The big hammer in his hand did not keep attacking. He allowed Han Sen\u2019s Sky Vine Radish God Lance to keep striking him, but he was still unable to inflict deadly, fatal wounds on him.\n\n\u201cEven if I cannot make use of all my power, you cannot damage my God Spirit body. Let\u2019s see how long you can keep it up. Once your power has been exhausted, it will be time for me to kill you.\u201d Kill Sky God\u2019s voice was so cold that it made one feel a chill deep in their bones.\n\nHan Sen did not know how long his Super God Spirit mode will last. This was the first time he had used Super God Spirit mode as a true god. For now, he did not feel uncomfortable or anything.\n\nIt was similar to Wan\u2019er not disturbing him. Super God Spirit mode should have lasted a long time. If Han Sen wanted to leave, Kill Sky God could not stop him.\n\nIf he left now, Wan\u2019er would be done for. If he brought Wan\u2019er with him, the Super God Spirit mode would be gone. That would have made it impossible to flee.\n\nUnless it was absolutely necessary, Han Sen would not give up Wan\u2019er. Besides the fact that he had been taking Wan\u2019er with him for very long, even if it was a dog, he would feel emotion toward it.\n\nPlus, there were many secrets regarding Wan\u2019er that he had yet learned. Han Sen had also enjoyed three drinks with Qin Xiu and promised him he would take care of Wan\u2019er. He could not just back out now.\n\n\u201cWith things becoming like this, I cannot care too much. I will have to use the Holy Kirin\u2019s holy spirit to get out of this.\u201d Han Sen had no other choice.\n\nHan Sen knew Kill Sky God\u2019s real power was not as invincible as he was making it out to be. When his body landed, he did not have an absolute suppress power. Otherwise, Sky Vine Radish God Lance would not have hurt him. His god skills made his body stronger than a true god class elite. Even with a buff off a god skill, he would have been unable to destroy his body with the Sky Vine Radish God Lance.\n\nIf he had a buff from the Holy Kirin\u2019s holy spirit, there was a chance of success. If he used the Holy Kirin\u2019s holy spirit now, he would expose the fact that Dollar was Han Sen. Fortunately, no one knew Han Sen was human. Even if he exposed himself, the God Spirits would not come after him for a while. As for the future, Han Sen would just have to wait and see how it all shook out.\n\nKatcha!\n\nWhile Han Sen prepared to summon the Kirin\u2019s holy spirit to possess the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, he suddenly heard something crack open far away in space. In the space around, Han Sen and Kill Sky God\u2019s power broke everything into dust. There was nothing left to break.\n\nHan Sen heard that sound. He thought it was terrible. He turned around and saw Destiny\u2019s Tower display a crack. It had probably endured too many hits.\n\nBefore Han Sen reacted, a gold, holy light came out from the crack. There was suddenly a blonde lady rising from the crack.\n\nHer blonde hair was waving as much as her clothes were. Wan\u2019er was sleeping inside Destiny\u2019s Tower. Now, Wan\u2019er had become the blonde-haired lady. Her whole body released a weird, blonde light that made her body look like a dream. It did not look real.\n\nWan\u2019er looked like Han Sen\u2019s Super God Spirit mode, but it was a bit different.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s eyes were open. Clearly, she had gotten rid of her sleeping mode, but her gold eyes still had no focus. She was like a zombie.\n\n\u201cWan\u2019er\u2026 Wan\u2019er\u2026 Im\u2026 Impossible\u2026 How are you still alive\u2026 You cannot still be alive\u2026\u201d When Kill Sky God saw the blonde Wan\u2019er, his face changed. It was like he had just laid eyes on a ghost.\n\nEven earlier, when Han Sen hit him, he did not have this expression. He still exhibited the pride of a God Spirit.\n\nAfter seeing Wan\u2019er for a brief moment, he was freaking out. Han Sen thought it was strange how he had just lost it like this.\n\nKill Sky God recognized Wan\u2019er, which did not make Han Sen feel weird.\n\nThere was an 80% to 90% chance that Kill Sky God was one of the God Spirits that descended way back when. It was not a surprise for him to have seen Wan\u2019er with the rest of Sacred. Seeing his face, he seemed absolutely terrified of Wan\u2019er. That made Han Sen feel like it was unbelievable.\n\nIt all happened in a moment. Wan\u2019er came out of Destiny\u2019s Tower. Her unfocused eyes fell on Han Sen, which made him feel a chill.\n\nCha!\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s body suddenly went blurry in front of Han Sen. With Han Sen\u2019s vision, he was not able to see where she moved.\n\nSubconsciously, Han Sen fell back. He noticed that Wan\u2019er was not going after him. That pretty and soft body of hers went before Kill Sky God. She raised her right arm without any emotion. Her hand was like a knife slashing down from up high. The blonde hair and gold clothes were waving as she struck.\n\nKill Sky God\u2019s face looked shocked. His hands were holding a giant hammer. He swung it at Wan\u2019er as he fell back.\n\nWan\u2019er\u2019s hand was full of a golden flame. She continued her downward strike. The giant hammer, which had destroyed everything, was like tofu being cut in half by her hand.\n\nKill Sky God\u2019s face was wretched. He was unable to completely fall back. His face had been cut from his forehead to his jaw by Wan\u2019er\u2019s fingertip. It was like the center of his face had a red line."
