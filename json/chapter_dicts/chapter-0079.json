    "text": "Han Sen was no master at rock-paper-scissors, but he had made an effort to improve his ability to make more accurate predictions. It wasn\u2019t for games, but for knowing in advance a creature\u2019s habits and movements.\n\nFor an archer, it was undoubtedly a very important ability.\n\nAlmost anyone could shoot at a target. And there were numerous people who could hit the bullseye from 150 feet away. However, creatures wouldn\u2019t stand still all the time, so it was important to be able to predict their movements.\n\nTo grasp the fleeting opportunity, prejudge the enemy's action, and shoot to kill were Han Sen\u2019s specialties. Or he wouldn\u2019t have chosen archery to practice.\n\nWhen he first entered God\u2019s Sanctuary, he didn\u2019t have a nice bow and arrows, so he practiced sneak attacks, which had even higher demands for one\u2019s pre-judgment and reflexes. A little mistake would leave him unable to kill a creature with one blow, which would result in the most terrible counterattack.\n\nAfter his first month in God\u2019s Sanctuary, Han Sen never missed in a single attack, which proved his outstanding skills of pre-judgment and timing.\n\nNow with so many geno points gained, Han Sen had improved greatly in his reflexes as well. It would be difficult for one to win against him in a game like this one.\n\n\"Rock-paper-scissors\u2026\"\n\nThe moment when Fang Jingqi said \"scissors,\" Han Sen and Fang Jingqi reached their hands out again. Han Sen had struck with scissors, while Fang went with paper.\n\nTang didn\u2019t expect to lose, and when it hit him that he should grab the plate, his face was covered in wine and some even got into his nostrils, leaving a burning sensation.\n\n\"Tang lost a point.\" Fang Jingqi wrote it down on a notepad seriously.\n\nTang of course didn\u2019t take the loss well. After wiping his face with a towel, he stared at Han Sen and said, \"Again.\"\n\nHan Sen was certainly happy to oblige. The two were at it again. Claiming to be the king of rock-paper-scissors, Tang won less than 40 percent of the rounds, in which Han Sen was able to block the wine he poured every single time. In the rounds where Tang lost rock-paper-scissors, Han Sen was faster than him and got him every time, leaving Tang soaked in wine.\n\nIn the beginning, Tang would wipe it away, but later he was so focused on beating his opponent that he would just let it be.\n\n\"No! Let\u2019s play finger-guessing instead. It\u2019s easy to cheat in rock-paper-scissors,\" Tang Zhenliu could not help but yell after losing seven, and then eight, rounds in a row.\n\n\"OK, but please tell me the rules, as I\u2019ve never played finger-guessing before,\" Han Sen said.\n\n\"The rules are simple...\" Tang explained the rules.\n\nFinger-guessing was the same type of game as rock-paper-scissors, but in finger-guessing, the two players\u2019 hands had to be placed in front of their body at all times, so the other party could see more clearly and there was less a chance of cheating and changing one\u2019s mind.\n\nHan Sen had not played this one before, so he lost the first four rounds of finger-guessing, but Tang wasn\u2019t really cheered by this fact as he was still unable to get any wine on Han Sen\u2019s face.\n\nAfter four rounds, Han Sen had mastered the essence of finger-guessing and his excellent skills in pre-judgment and quick reflexes gave him the upper hand again.\n\nWine constantly hit Tang\u2019s face, which made him even more eager to win. In a while, he was so wet that it was as if he had just climbed out of a wine bucket. Even his trousers were dripping with wine.\n\nTang thought to himself, \"How could this be... I should be invincible... Something must be wrong.\"\n\nFang Jingqi saw that Tang was miserable and tried to stop him twice. But Tang was completely amuck, and all he wanted was to get his money back.\n\n\"I need revenge! I have to soak him in wine as well.\"\n\n\"No, I will definitely win the next rounds!\"\n\n\"One win, I need one win at least.\"\n\n\"Let me have one win... Just one and then I\u2019ll stop...\"\n\nTang\u2019s expectation shrunk lower and lower, but he didn\u2019t win a single round in the end.\n\nIn the last few rounds, Tang was a mess and couldn\u2019t even win finger-guessing anymore, so Han Sen was in complete control.\n\nQu Wange saw it was late and took Yan back to the private room. She thought Han Sen was probably miserable now, playing drinking games with Tang Zhenliu and Fang Jingqi.\n\nWhen she approached the room, she couldn\u2019t hear anything, so she was wondering if Han Sen was already dead drunk by then.\n\nPushing the door open, she was surprised.\n\nHan Sen and Fang Jingqi were sitting at the table, drinking tea while chatting. Han Sen looked sober and clean, as if nothing had happened.\n\nHowever, Tang was sitting on the sofa alone, soaking wet and haggard.\n\nQu Wange thought Tang looked almost like an assault victim, with his eyes full of tears.\n\n\"Tang, what happened to you?\" Qu Wange was shocked. By no means could she believe that Tang Zhenliu was the one getting bullied.\n\nTang just understood what had happened. Without answering her, he fiercely threw himself at Fang Jingqi, shouting, \"Damn you Jingqi, how dare you set me up...\"\n\nNot quite sure what was going on, Qu Wange saw Han Sen smiling at her. He asked, \"Ms. Qu, what\u2019s the price of the advanced nutrition solution packages?\"\n\n\"Now Yan is on the package that\u2019s one hundred thousand dollars per month, the effect of which is very limited. The course intensity at Saint Paul would probably call for the package costing three hundred thousand dollars per month. Or her grades and fitness would both suffer,\" Qu Wange explained.\n\n\"If she were to use the top package, plus senior physician service, how much would that cost annually?\" Han Sen asked again.\n\n\"If that's the case, you can choose the school's S-level package, which includes the best of everything and costs 15 million per year.\" Qu Wange regarded Han Sen curiously.\n\n\"Great, please get Yan the S-level package when you get a chance,\" said Han Sen after he saw the newly transferred 16.7 million dollars in his account."
