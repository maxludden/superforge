    "text": "As the white whale left the Ice Blue system, Han Sen guided it towards where Night River King had been stationed. He was unable to find anything out of the ordinary there, however, and he couldn\u2019t find a single trace of that weird purple stuff that Night River King had mentioned repeatedly.\n\nHan Sen even went to see the Ice Blue Knight who had taken over Night River King\u2019s position, but the knight hadn\u2019t seen anything strange during his time stationed there.\n\n\u201cWeird. What was that purple thing Night River King was talking about? What about the journal entries he made in code?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t plan on lingering in the system to figure it out, either.\n\nHan Sen turned the white whale out of the system, plotting a course back to Narrow Moon. He didn\u2019t see Under Overbearing again, and neither did he see the Black Hole Spider. They did encounter many more of those Galactic Shrimp. The attacks of the shrimp were unable to penetrate the defenses of the white whale, though. And added to that, none of the creatures were as fast as the white whale. Having a powerful ship like the white whale ensured their safety as they traveled, assuming that they only ran into ordinary xenogeneics like the Galactic Shrimp. If they got into trouble, it would be because they bumped into a creature like Under Overbearing or the Black Hole Spider. Of course, even if that happened, they had the deified elite Yisha on board.\n\nThey had good luck in their travels. Yisha and Han Sen were able to depart the systems of chaos with absolute safety. They would soon be back in Narrow Moon.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cDude, what happened? Why has every noble across every planet been ordered to go to Full Moon Hall?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Knife Queen is back!\u201d\n\n\u201cKnife Queen is back? How is that possible? I thought she died in the systems of chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what all the nobles thought, too. That\u2019s why they plundered her legacy inventory without fear. But she has really come back, and not just that; she\u2019s come back deified.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Queen has become deified? This is awesome! We Rebate finally have a deified elite in our ranks. Who would dare underestimate us now? Queen is way too powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeehee! It might be good for us, but what about the nobles who divided up her things? They stole her legacy and crushed her student Han Sen under their feet. Now that she has come back deified, they must be shivering in their boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had it coming. They think they\u2019re so high and mighty, bullying a student.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that those nobles are going to get told off. They always bully us, don\u2019t they? And we can never fight back! Now that they are in trouble\u2026 Well, it\u2019s what they deserve.\u201d\n\nAs Narrow Moon\u2019s people were discussing Knife Queen\u2019s return, a serious discussion was being held in Full Moon Hall.\n\n\u201cNo, absolutely not! Miss Knife\u2026 Han Sen is just an outsider! He does not have what it takes to be our Holy Child,\u201d an elder said, shaking his head forcefully.\n\nFlower King said, \u201cKnife\u2026 Miss\u2026 Don\u2019t you think that this is a little inappropriate? The Holy Child has always been the best and most promising of the Rebate. Han Sen isn\u2019t even one of our kind. Even if we force him to become our Holy Child, the rest of our citizens will vehemently object to the selection.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Knife, please think about this!\u201d Black Moon King liked Han Sen, but even he did not think that this was right. They risked angering their entire race.\n\nAll the nobles were arguing against Yisha\u2019s decision to elect Han Sen as the Holy Child. Full Moon Hall was filled with so many shouting voices that it was louder than a supermarket.\n\nMoon Wheel King raised his hand to tell everyone to quiet down. Then, he looked at Yisha and said, \u201cKnife, we were not considerate to you and Han Sen in your absence. We can give him whatever he deserves, but the position of Holy Child is something of gross importance. It affects the very legacy and glory of our race. Allowing an outsider to take this position is in no way appropriate. You must think about this decision some more.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you guys done?\u201d Yisha sat at the head of the conference table. She coldly looked upon all of the nobles that had gathered there.\n\nAll of those nobles felt a massive chill as her eyes came to stare at each of them in turn. They fell utterly silent under the weight of her gaze. The same was true for Flower King, as it was all the others.\n\nAfter everyone stopped talking, Yisha spoke in a slow, deliberate voice. \u201cWhat if I insist that Han Sen becomes our Holy Child?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnife Queen, if you\u2026 if you insist, then you\u2019ll have to forgive us for being unreasonable. The elders will never agree to this notion, and I am sure none of the kings here in Full Moon Hall agree to it, either.\u201d The members of the Council of Elders kept trying to convince her. \u201cKnife Queen! We are objecting to your plan in order to preserve the legacy and glory of the Rebate. We cannot allow everything we have built for the Rebate to be destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying I am destroying the Rebate as a whole?\u201d Yisha asked coldly.\n\n\u201cKnife Queen, that is not what we meant\u2026\u201d The elder wanted to say more, but Yisha cut him off.\n\nYisha swept her gaze across the nobles and stopped at Moon Wheel King. \u201cI called you all here to tell you of the decision I have made. I did not call you here for you to voice your opinions on the matter. Starting from today, Han Sen is the Holy Child of the Rebate. If you have a problem with the decision, let me hear it now.\u201d\n\nMany of the nobles were frozen. Although they objected, no one wished to square-off against Yisha. They all looked at Moon Wheel King.\n\nMoon Wheel King frowned and looked at Yisha. \u201cWhat if we all object at once?\u201d\n\nYisha laughed. She stood up, ignoring Moon Wheel King. She looked down upon all of the nobles and slowly said, \u201cListen up, people! From now on, Narrow Moon is my Narrow Moon. The Rebate have only one queen. Whoever follows me will live, but anyone who seeks to betray me will die. You can object, but if you directly disobey one of my commands, I will consider you an enemy. I do not mind an injection of fresh blood to fill up the ranks of Narrow Moon.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nOver the next few months, political instability swept through the Rebate. The people in power kept changing, and families rose and fell on a daily basis.\n\nHan Sen really admired Yisha\u2019s decisiveness. Once she made her mind up, she took sole control of Rebate society without looking back.\n\nShe\u2019d lacked the strength to make such a bold power-grab before, but now that she was deified, she could suppress anyone who rose against her. She ruled single-handedly, which allowed complicated issues to get resolved much faster.\n\nBut other problems began to appear. There were many different factions within Rebate society, and no one could say for certain if Yisha would be able to unite the fragmented society while maintaining her dictatorship.\n\nSome issues could not be solved through power alone. Claiming the throne had been Yisha\u2019s first step, but there was a long road ahead of her.\n\nHan Sen was confident in Yisha, but he honestly didn\u2019t pay much attention to the political turmoil of the Rebate. He was busy investigating the information given to him by Mister White.\n\nThe techniques of the Xuan Men were very deep. There was a great deal of information to sift through, which included more than just a few geno arts. Some of what Han Sen read would take a few hundred years to truly comprehend."
