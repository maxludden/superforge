    "text": "Dragon Lady followed Han Sen into the base. Wang Yuhang and Xie Qing King then took up positions on opposite sides of the gate. They were like two soldiers, just smiling at the intruders.\n\n\u201cBrother King, what is your least favorite meal?\u201d Wang Yuhang, standing at the side of the gate, suddenly decided to ask.\n\n\u201cHmm, I am not sure. I like pretty much everything I am able to eat. I even like all desserts, such as stinky tofu,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cBrother King, you really do like to eat everything! But you know what? I know of something that you would not like to eat,\u201d Wang Yuhang said with sincerity.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Xie Qing King rose to the question.\n\n\u201cA closed gate. Would you like to eat that?\u201d Wang Yuhang asked, laughing to himself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat that. I don\u2019t think anyone would like to.\u201d Xie Qing King smiled.\n\n\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Some people might love to eat that. And they certainly enjoy it. They can\u2019t get enough of it!\u201d Wang Yuhang smiled, and he looked right at Sad Night.\n\n\u201cWhat a rude slave.\u201d Sad Night was angered by the jest. He drew his sword and sent a scary swordlight soaring towards Wang Yuhang\u2019s neck.\n\nHe could not kill Han Sen, but he did not care about disposing of his slaves.\n\nDong!\n\nA silver shadow blocked Sad Night\u2019s swordlight. It was a leopard, composed of silver light, from the looks of it.\n\nSad Night was not quite sure what it was, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. He swung his sword like lightning to do battle with the leopard.\n\nSad Night\u2019s sword skills were wonderful. It was to be expected; after all, he was the son of a King. His fighting techniques were top-dog.\n\nAfter a dozen strikes, the silver leopard was slain. The creature vanished into thin air.\n\n\u201cIf you keep talking crap, you\u2019ll end up just like that!\u201d Sad Night said, staring right at Wang Yuhang.\n\n\u201cIf you like to kill so much, would you like to do a few more?\u201d Xie Qing King moved his fingers to scribble out a few more of those silver leopards. They quickly surrounded Sad Night.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t been difficult for Sad Night to take out the silver leopard, but there were so many of them now. They were all Viscounts, and they worked together smoothly to establish a proper formation. It\u2019d be hard, that was for sure.\n\nSpeechless and No Flower were shocked by this. The ability to draw beasts was very rare.\n\nSad Night killed one silver leopard, then found that Xie Qing King had already drawn another to replace it. He kept spawning more and more, as soon as each one died. The numbers didn\u2019t reduce, and the fight looked as if it could go on forever. The leopards were able to get a few hits in every now and again, too. Although none of the wounds were grievous, it sullied his image.\n\n\u201cCome and help!\u201d Seeing Black Cliff and the others merely waiting and watching, Sad Night suddenly felt fear. He couldn\u2019t keep fighting these leopards by himself.\n\nJust as the Rebate looked ready to strike, Xie Qing King closed the book and the leopards disappeared. He coldly said, \u201cJust as I thought; a run-of-the-mill King\u2019s child. Just a bully.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d Sad Night was so angry, but knew he could not compete. When he was flying solo, he hadn\u2019t been able to take out the leopards. If he was unable to take out the leopards, he\u2019d be unable to take on Xie Qing King.\n\nThe Rebate were curious about all this, though. They wondered where Han Sen might have found such a man. In a solo fight, Sad Night would not be able to beat him.\n\nThe drawing abilities were rare, too. They had never seen it before.\n\n\u201cYou are a bully, too! If you have the guts to do it, fight him mano-a-mano! I guarantee you cannot fight Sad Night solo,\u201d one of the Rebate Barons shouted to Xie Qing King, referring to the fact that there were so many shadow leopards.\n\n\u201cYou sure you want to engage me in a solo fight?\u201d Xie Qing King looked at Sad Night with a smile. He didn\u2019t even spare the Baron a glance.\n\n\u201cSo what, yeah? But do you dare to come at me?\u201d Sad Night knew it sounded ridiculous as soon as he said it. He was not too happy about this situation.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Don\u2019t go crying to daddy when you get beaten up.\u201d Xie Qing King smiled at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t even be able to cry,\u201d Sad Night said coldly.\n\n\u201cThen come on! It\u2019s been a long time since I last had the chance to throw my weight around. The creatures here are so strong, so it\u2019s hard to find someone weak enough to enjoy bullying. Now the opportunity to do just that has come.\u201d Xie Qing King put his book away, and then the silver book became a set of armor to plate him. Then, he stretched his limbs.\n\nSad Night knew Xie Qing King was mocking him. He looked murderous, and his sword was like the wind as it came to take a bite out of Xie Qing King.\n\nHe had a terrible thirst for bloodshed right now. He might not have been able to kill Han Sen, but he could most certainly kill a family member. Even though it would cause him trouble, this was something Night King River could sort out.\n\nAs the swordlight flashed toward him, Xie Qing King was still stretching his wrists and rolling his neck.\n\nPang!\n\nJust as the swordlight was going to strike his nose, Xie Qing King threw a punch. The silver light broke the swordlight.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s strong body began to gleam with silver light. He was like a demon, and he began throwing punches towards Sad Night.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu-Alu!\u201d\n\nA raging bevy of fists was coming at Sad Night like a furious storm. Sad Night knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back, so he blocked it with a sword. He was like a boat in the middle of the rain.\n\nThe fists kept striking the sword, shaking it.\n\nA katcha noise sounded. The sword shattered to pieces under the pressure of Xie Qing King\u2019s repeated attacks. The punches eventually landed on Sad Night.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Sad Night was sent soaring through the air with a body that had been totally twisted by the punches. His armor had shattered, even. His gear had been completely destroyed.\n\nEveryone was shocked, and no one had expected that would be the end result. The son of a King had been beaten by a guardsman. He couldn\u2019t resist the flurry of attacks, and he was broken and sent flying.\n\nThey found out that Xie Qing King was actually scarier when he put the book away.\n\nA few of the Rebate were shocked. They wished to save Sad Night, and only Black Cliff did not move.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you guys love to fight in groups.\u201d Xie Qing King was wearing an evil smile. His silver armor returned to the shape of a book. So, he drew something inside and brought a new shadow to life.\n\nBut this time, it wasn\u2019t a leopard that came out. It was Xie Qing King himself.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu-Alu!\u201d The shadows of Xie Qing King all began punching the Rebate."
