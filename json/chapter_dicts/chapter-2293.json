    "text": "\u201cDad, the woman has no more blood. Dad\u2026 he cracked open the woman\u2019s brain\u2026\u201d Bao\u2019er kept reporting what was happening.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, stop looking!\u201d Han Sen called Bao\u2019er back into his arms. He didn\u2019t want her to see such a bloody scene.\n\nBao\u2019er was actually quite old at this point, but in Han Sen\u2019s eyes, she\u2019d be a little girl forever.\n\nBao\u2019er jumped off of Han Sen\u2019s shoulder to sit on his chest. She looked curiously at the Four Symbols Seal and the trapped xenogeneic that was still struggling inside.\n\nHan Sen still couldn\u2019t feel anything behind him, but after hearing what Bao\u2019er had said, he felt sick with worry. The images of what she had described kept repeating inside his mind, and nothing he tried to think about could scrub them away.\n\n\u201cJade Cat, what are you doing!\u201d Han Sen finally shouted at the statue of the jade cat.\n\nThe jade cat already seemed to be sleeping again, and it showed no reaction to Han Sen\u2019s call.\n\nAfter a while, the prisoner\u2019s chains began to rattle again. As it left the space behind Han Sen\u2019s back, it slowly entered his field of vision. The prisoner left in pretty much the same manner that he arrived, slowly and seemingly vacant-minded.\n\nThere was one small difference, however. He was dragging the corpse of a woman behind him.\n\nTo be more accurate, that was not the body of a woman. It was a female creature\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t see what the female creature\u2019s facial features had been, because a large hole had been punched into the creature\u2019s head. There was a gaping cavity where the face had been. The upper part of her body was humanoid, though, and the lower body was like a snake. She looked like one of the Ghana, but unlike the Ghana, there was a spiraling horn on her head. It was silver and around one foot long, and it was reminiscent of a unicorn\u2019s horn.\n\nThe snake scales of her lower body were silver, as well. They were so bright that they made her form seem a little transparent. Holes had been torn through her head and chest, but there was no blood oozing out. It was just as Bao\u2019er had originally said, in that the blood of the woman had run dry.\n\n\u201cWhat is that weirdo\u2019s presence here supposed to mean? Why would he draw a woman on my back?\u201d Han Sen wondered, somewhat shaken.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t seem to be injured or impaired. His body was fine, his Galactic Lobster Armor was fine, and it looked like the creepy prisoner guy was leaving now that he had drawn his picture.\n\nAlthough the whole experience had been rather disturbing, the creature hadn\u2019t actually hurt him. So, Han Sen knew he\u2019d just have to stop thinking about it.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er! Could you use some water to wash your dad\u2019s armor? Wash away the mess he made,\u201d Han Sen said to Bao\u2019er. While the paint hadn\u2019t been harmful, he was still unhappy to have it on him.\n\nBao\u2019er jumped off of Han Sen\u2019s chest and walked behind him to do as he asked. Then her surprised voice said, \u201cShe is gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is gone?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped into his throat.\n\n\u201cThe picture he drew is now gone,\u201d Bao\u2019er said.\n\n\u201cHow could it be gone?\u201d Han Sen was very confused about this, and so he proceeded to ask, \u201cDid the picture just get smeared?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er shook her head. \u201cDad, there\u2019s nothing on your back. It is very clean, and there is not even the smallest semblance of a bloodstain. The ugly woman drawing is all gone.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had no idea what to make of this, so he asked Mister White, \u201cMister White, what is going on?\u201d\n\nMister White shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand any of this, either. We couldn\u2019t see your back, and we were only able to see that he was drawing something on you. I don\u2019t know what it was that he actually drew.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t like not knowing, but there was little that he could do about it. He checked his body and noted how nothing seemed to have happened, so for now, he shelved all thoughts about it.\n\nNothing strange happened after that. The four of them kept sending power into the Four Symbols Seal. It maintained a firm hold on the snared xenogeneic clone. Days passed, and after what felt like forever, they reached the ten-day deadline.\n\nAlthough the four of them were quite exhausted by this point, they had at least managed to survive the ten days.\n\nWhen the xenogeneics returned to their palace lairs and the doors of their palaces closed, the four of them almost collapsed.\n\nThe jade cat statue smiled and began speaking again. \u201cCongratulations! You have passed the Sacred Leader\u2019s test. You can now receive the relic left behind by the Sacred Leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the treasure?\u201d Han Sen asked, forcing himself to ignore his exhaustion.\n\n\u201cRight here,\u201d the jade cat statue said. The jade pillar below its feet then suddenly opened up, revealing a small jade box. It was impossible to guess what might lay inside.\n\nHan Sen started forward to pick up the box, but then, his heart jumped up. He saw that Crime was holding a broken sword, slashing towards Han Sen.\n\nThe blood kirin was angered by this, and so it roared and leaped towards Crime.\n\nBut Crime\u2019s darkness covered everything, and Han Sen\u2019s eyes were unable to pierce it.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t move his eyes, though. The bird\u2019s nest was still on his head, and he leaped towards where the box had been before everything went black.\n\nIn Crime\u2019s area-of-effect, all seven of Han Sen\u2019s senses were blocked. But because he had the protection of the bird\u2019s nest, he wasn\u2019t concerned about any attacks that Crime might launch.\n\nBut the next second, Han Sen\u2019s face changed. A weird power came down to strike the bird\u2019s nest. The power locked onto the bird\u2019s nest and pulled it away from Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\nThen, he and Bao\u2019er were tied up by something like a rope. The rope jerked them roughly to the side.\n\nThe darkness faded. Han Sen noticed that he and Bao\u2019er were now bound by loop upon loop of white rope. Next to them, there was a net with Han Sen\u2019s bird\u2019s nest inside it. The net must have been quite special if it was able to bind a deified bird\u2019s nest.\n\nCrime held the net in one hand and the jade box in the other.\n\n\u201cThank you for helping me obtain the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure,\u201d Crime said coldly to Han Sen, holding the box casually under one arm.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Mister White frowned at Crime.\n\nCrime smiled and said, \u201cMister White, I am your faithful guard Crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like Crime, but Crime is just a King-class guard. You most certainly aren\u2019t. Crime wouldn\u2019t possess Prince Fourteen\u2019s Sky Net,\u201d Mister White stated flatly, his frown deepening.\n\nCrime slid the box into his chest pocket. Then, he lifted his broken knife and spoke to Mister White. \u201cYou think too much. Although I am half-deified, I am still your guard. But aside from you, I have a duty to Prince Fourteen, as well. Prince Fourteen wants this item, so I will have to take this back with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister White, we both work for Prince Fourteen. You have helped me a great deal, and I will tell Prince Fourteen of your involvement. But this is not where this should be discussed\u2026 We need to get rid of him first,\u201d Crime said. Then his broken knife came swinging towards Han Sen."
