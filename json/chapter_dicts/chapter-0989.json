But regardless, his lifeforce is still in-play. If its existence continues in this way, it will instead become a spirit orb. Think of it as a weakened spirit stone, that is unable to revive anything. But, it can be consumed by other spirits. If another spirit consumes a spirit orb, they are granted a considerable number of self geno points.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know there\u2019ll still be a spirit orb? What if the emperor has already taken it?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cIt sounds to me like Yaksha is the emperor who has put all this in motion. Perhaps something happened to him, long ago, and now he has returned to finish the task,\u201d Moment Queen said.\n\n\u201cAnd you think we can do combat with an emperor?\u201d Han Sen still feared the spirit.\n\nThe aqua dragon had been unable to defeat Yaksha, and Han Sen himself had only opened three of his gene locks. Hesitance and doubts as to whether he could defeat such a foe were entirely reasonable.\n\nThe only reason he had chased after Yaksha thus far was because of Bao\u2019er\u2019s support and his newfound ability to obscure the seventh sense of others.\n\nMoment Queen, seemingly alarmed, tried to explain the gravity of the situation in a rush. \u201cYaksha came out of a ding and fought a dragon immediately after, you said. He will undoubtedly be in a weakened state, and if we go after him now, we can kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, your spirit stone is a part of your body. You can\u2019t respawn if you fall in battle,\u201d Han Sen told her.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw away my life by challenging a foe I knew I could not hope to beat. But you said there were several creature carcasses, scattered along the way here. That in itself tells me Yaksha is weakened. Pride is a spirit\u2019s greatest shackle, and an emperor wouldn\u2019t be willing to eat such low-life creatures unless he was absolutely desperate. Before he consumes the spirit orb he is after, he\u2019ll be at his weakest. If we find him, we can kill him and take the orb for ourselves.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought what she had been saying made sense, and perhaps it would be best to nip this entire mess in its bud before things could get any worse. Han Sen didn\u2019t want Yaksha to get any more dangerous. Moment Queen wouldn\u2019t needlessly risk her life, and Han Sen needed all the self geno points he could get.\n\n\u201cFine. Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d With Bao\u2019er by his side, he felt a lot more confident.\n\nIf Yaksha was able to, he would have killed the dragon when he fought it in the subterranean labyrinth. Yaksha had suffered much damage, and it was clear he had not yet recovered his health.\n\nMoment Queen raced through the trees, as Han Sen followed from behind.\n\nBao\u2019er observed her surroundings with great interest as she clutched a bottle. She was like a puppy, swinging her head left and right to see everything she could.\n\nAlthough it seemed as if she was in the biggest rush ever, Moment Queen still exercised caution. But so far, after a great distance had been traversed, nothing curious revealed itself. The signature vines of the forest were still all-present, woven between each tree, but that was it.\n\nAfter crossing a distance of ten miles, Moment Queen stopped and said, \u201cThis is it. It\u2019s right in front of us.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stood near Moment Queen and saw a great clump of vines, all tangled together to form a sort of wall. It was rather like a wicker basket, except for its strong resemblance to a castle.\n\nAs they wondered whether or not to enter, something let out a sudden roar.\n\nIt sounded like a beast, one that used sonic powers to amplify its cries. It was so loud, they both felt as if their chests had been delivered a direct punch. They even spilt blood from their mouths.\n\n\u201cThere is a super creature inside,\u201d Moment Queen said, as she wiped the blood from her lips.\n\nHan Sen, wiping his own blood, saw that Bao\u2019er was completely unharmed. She looked in the direction the noise had come from.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Han Sen wanted to leave.\n\nIf there was indeed a super creature inside, there was no feasible way they could defeat it.\n\nBut, before he could turn to leave, something appeared to exit the castle. Without wasting a second, he masked their lifeforces and moved to hide in the nearby bushes.\n\nIt was a giant centipede. It looked terribly wounded, and it wasted no time scuttling out and racing off between the trees in panic.\n\nNot long after, something else came out of the castle. It was Yaksha.\n\nYaksha looked to be in terrible shape, as well. His scaled-armor was entirely broken, and only a few roughed-up plates remained.\n\nOne of his arms had been almost completely severed. Only loose flaps and strings of skin connected it to his shoulder.\n\n\u201cGodd*mn dragon king; I\u2019m not done with you yet!\u201d Yaksha shouted, while holding the arm that looked ready to drop. Then he disappeared.\n\nHan Sen froze. It was a horrible sight, seeing him in such condition, and he wondered what had occurred. From what he could guess, Yaksha had been set-up.\n\nMoment Queen frowned and looked at Han Sen. She said, \u201cI have heard about the existence of a certain dragon king before. If it resides inside that castle, we may have a struggle ahead of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Han Sen saw Yaksha fleeing the area, and his expectations of obtaining a spirit orb had gone with him.\n\nMoment Queen said, \u201cDragon King is a famous emperor of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and he possesses the power of dragons. Everyone obeys him, and if he failed to reach the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, I can\u2019t imagine my chances. They\u2019d be far slimmer, to say the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you still going to risk entering that castle?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he looked at the menacing construct.\n\n\u201cNot even Yaksha could defeat Dragon King; I doubt we\u2019d fare any better,\u201d Moment Queen said.\n\nHan Sen nodded. He didn\u2019t want to risk Bao\u2019er\u2019s life by bringing her inside, either.\n\nAs they turned to leave the area, though, Bao\u2019er leapt out of Han Sen\u2019s arms and rapidly crawled inside the castle."
