    "text": "If Exquisite was in peak condition, knocking her out wouldn\u2019t have been so easy. But right now, she was completely exhausted. Her entire body was running on fumes, and she would never have expected Han Sen to attack her. So, she was instantly knocked unconscious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must do something that will affect a whole race, so I cannot let anyone else know about it.\u201d Han Sen picked up Exquisite\u2019s unconscious form. He looked up to the darkening sky above him, and as he did so, his eyes started to turn white. Then, his whole body began to glow as he activated his super god spirit mode.\n\nAlthough the transformation had only just begun, the weird power that had been clinging to Han Sen was vanquished the moment his super god body activated. It was completely gone.\n\nIn a matter of moments, the glowing, white power disappeared as well. Han Sen\u2019s body returned to normal again.\n\n\u201cFinally, it is gone!\u201d The foreign energy that had plagued him had vanished, and he felt much relief. Bao Lian\u2019s attack had been expunged. The scary God Spirit Storm wasn\u2019t gone, though. It was still there in the sky.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nLightning flashed across the pitch-black sky, sending bursts of light across the clouds.\n\nWhen the lightning struck, the whole sky rumbled with thunder. The lightning and thunder began to build in frequency and intensity. It made the whole sky and earth become an ocean of electricity.\n\nHan Sen looked glum. He didn\u2019t know if the God Spirit Storm was a remnant of Bao Lian\u2019s power, or if it simply wouldn\u2019t recede because it had already formed. Regardless, he was now stuck inside that God Spirit Storm. Any hope of an easy escape was gone.\n\nThat thunderstorm was so weird. Although the storm pulsed with lightning, the lightning bolts never damaged the grass when they touched down. It was like the lightning was fake.\n\nBut Han Sen knew the lightning was very real, but the element that composed it was rather special. And now that he was inside this thunderstorm, he couldn\u2019t use his teleportation techniques. The surrounding area seemed to be locked down by the storm.\n\nExquisite had depleted her energy reserves before Han Sen knocked her out. And even if she had been awake and full of power, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to teleport them away either.\n\n\u201cI have no idea if we can escape this God Spirit Storm alive.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t hesitate. Still holding Exquisite, he flew through the thunderstorm at full speed.\n\nLightning fell across his body like raindrops. Although it didn\u2019t hurt or numb him, he could definitely feel it.\n\nBoom! Boom!\n\nSomewhere within the thunderstorm off to Han Sen\u2019s side, a giant bolt of lightning exploded. But within the light of that bolt, he saw a shadow standing on the ground.\n\nThe burst of light was so bright that Han Sen could only make out the shape of the shadow. It was a monster with the head and horns of a bull. A pair of bat wings spread from its back.\n\nThat was all Han Sen could see in the momentary flash of light.\n\nHe didn\u2019t dare to think about it too much. Instead, he continued to fly forward at full speed. While he was flying, another burst of bright light exploded in front of him. Han Sen saw the bull monster appear in front of him, and it was approaching.\n\nThunder rolled with every step it took, and the creature moved with a mountainous sense of gravity. Its body was 100 meters tall, and every step caused the realm to quake.\n\nThe hair on Han Sen\u2019s arms stood on end. He knew he had been targeted by the scary xenogeneic, and while they hadn\u2019t made contact yet, Han Sen could feel that its presence was not a meager primitive class.\n\n\u201cSacrifice, are you calling me?\u201d The mountainous bull monster stood amidst the storm. It was like a thunderbolt itself. Its eyes were massive, and they looked straight at Han Sen. Its voice rumbled, but Han Sen could hear it clearly within the thunderstorm.\n\nAlthough it was looking at Han Sen, the monster was confused. It wasn\u2019t sure if Han Sen was its sacrifice.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped and he thought, \u201cBao Lian, that *sshole! His power put some sort of sacrificial marker on me that this deified can detect? No wonder the God Spirit Storm kept chasing me. He made me an offering for a deified xenogeneic!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve made a mistake. I\u2019m not your sacrifice. You should go and look elsewhere for it.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure if the monster would understand him, but the creature did appear rather intelligent. If the creature could be reasoned with, then perhaps he could talk his way out of this.\n\nThe bull monster heard what Han Sen said, but it didn\u2019t leave. It just looked at him and Exquisite.\n\n\u201cYou might not be my sacrifice, but you are already here. I cannot return empty-handed. I must take one of you with me as my sacrifice.\u201d The bull monster\u2019s voice echoed in the thunder.\n\nHan Sen understood what the bull monster meant. Either he or Exquisite would have to go with the creature.\n\nHe looked at the comatose Exquisite. There was no one to stop him from handing her over, but when he thought about Exquisite\u2019s desperation and willingness to die in order to save him, he knew that giving her to the bull monster wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t want to sacrifice himself, either.\n\n\u201cWe are both weak, low-level creatures. We cannot be your sacrifice. Why don\u2019t I take you somewhere else to find you a better sacrifice?\u201d\n\nThe bull monster didn\u2019t speak. It stood silently as peals of thunder continued to roll across the sky.\n\nAlthough it didn\u2019t speak, Han Sen understood what it meant. It had already made its mind up to take one of them as a sacrifice.\n\n\u201cDoes your sacrifice have to be a creature? Could it be something else?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind the shield that you\u2019re carrying on your back,\u201d said the bull monster\u2019s rumbling voice.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He knew immediately which shield the bull monster was talking about. It was referring to the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze.\n\n\u201cThis guy is smart, but he\u2019s just a xenogeneic. He isn\u2019t one of the Gana. Why does he want the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze? I\u2019m afraid that only the Gana can make full use of it.\u201d Han Sen was confused, and so he asked the bull monster, \u201cWhat do you want this shield for? This is a treasure belonging to the Gana. It can\u2019t be activated by someone who lacks the blood of the Gana.\u201d\n\nBut now that Han Sen had a moment to think about it, he understood why the bull monster had been willing to stand around talking to them instead of just killing them on sight.\n\n\u201cThis guy is scared of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. That\u2019s why he\u2019s being cautious instead of just attacking me.\u201d That realization was a great relief for Han Sen. If the bull monster had a reason to fear Han Sen, then he and Exquisite had a much better chance of escaping.\n\nAnd Han Sen had no intention of handing over the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. His opponent was just a xenogeneic, so who could tell if it would even keep its promise? At the moment, its fear of the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze was keeping it at bay. If Han Sen gave it the shield, however, that would be the same as forfeiting his life. Han Sen would never allow another to control his fate.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that I cannot use the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. This is a chance for me,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself."
