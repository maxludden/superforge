One sacred geno point gained.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nTwo days later, Han Sen finished a big pot of copper-toothed beast meat and even sucked the bones clean. He threw the bones into the fire so that there was nothing left.\n\nA total of seven sacred geno points was added to his former 18 points. Now Han Sen had 25 sacred geno points and his fitness had been further improved. He felt as though he had endless strength.\n\nLooking at the primitive shrieky beast he kept in the cage now, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but smacked his lips.\n\nShrieky beasts were relatively small and had no hair, so he could just throw it in the pot entirely when it finished evolving. That was why Han San had chosen a shrieky beast to evolve.\n\nYesterday Qin Xuan had divided the meat of the purple-winged dragon among her gang. All she had was a smaller half of the body so all each person would get was just a slice, about a thousandth of the body, which wouldn\u2019t be of much use at all. Hence like most people, Han Sen chose to get two hundred thousand dollars as the reward instead of the slice of meat.\n\nHan Sen was still short of cash. It cost money for his family to live better and he also needed money to buy some necessities. When checking his bank account, he found that he still only had less than three hundred thousand dollars.\n\n\"Three hundred thousand, a Z-steel arrow would cost that much,\" Han Sen put on a wry smile. He had collected the parts after his Z-steel arrow was broken by Son of Heaven and wanted to see if he could pay the seller to repair it.\n\n\"I have to get myself a beast soul arrow. Z-steel arrows were expensive and not as convenient. If I had a beast soul arrow, I wouldn't have to buy new arrows or pick up the arrow after I made the shot,\" though Han Sen, wondering where to find a beast soul arrow.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t interested in primitive beast soul arrows, which were barely better than his Z-steel arrow but much more expensive. What Han Sen wanted was a mutant beast soul arrow like the ones used by Son of Heaven and Yang Manli.\n\nAfter some thinking, Han Sen was ready to ask Yang Manli from which creature she had gained her mutant beast soul arrow. Maybe he could go hunting it and try his luck as well.\n\n\"Yang Manli seems to dislike me. I\u2019m afraid she will not tell me. Forget it, I haven\u2019t been back home for days. I\u2019ll go back and search on the Skynet for information about where the arrow beast soul are generally found near here.\" Han Sen teleported out of God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nWhen he returned home, his mother was still in Second God\u2019s Sanctuary and Han Yan was at school.\n\nAfter taking a bath, he started searching the Skynet. There were many former members of Steel Armor Sanctuary that had written about their experience. Although most was useless to Han Sen, he did manage to find one useful article.\n\nWhen Han Sen was going to read carefully, he suddenly heard the doorbell. Looking through the monitor, he found standing at the door were Xue Xi and her brother Fang Jingqi.\n\n\"Why is he here?\" Han Sen knew Fang Jingqi didn\u2019t like him and they also had some conflicts before, so he did not expect to see Fang Jingqi here.\n\nOpening the door, Han Sen said with a smile, \"Xi, you have not come to my house for many years.\"\n\nXue Xi looked a bit uneasy and whispered, \"If this isn\u2019t a good time, we will just leave.\"\n\nAlthough she tried to pull Fang Jingqi away, Fang Jingqi stood still and smiled at Han Sen, \"It\u2019s always a good time for friends, isn\u2019t it?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" Han Sen already understood that Fang Jingqi was looking for trouble.\n\nLetting Fang Jingqi and Xue Xi in, Han Sen handed them two bottles of water, \"Sorry. There is only water.\"\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t matter.\" Fang Jingqi did not touch the water and asked, \"Sen, which shelter are you in?\"\n\n\"Steel Armor Shelter,\" replied Han Sen.\n\n\"Sen, you are also in Steel Armor Shelter? How come Han Hao never mentioned it?\" Xue Xi was slightly startled.\n\nHan Sen said indifferently, \"Maybe we have never run into each other.\"\n\nXue Xi clearly didn\u2019t buy it, but she didn\u2019t continue to ask.\n\nFang Jingqi said, \"It so happens that a classmate of mine is also there. His name is Fist Guy. Have you heard of him?\"\n\n\"One of the three major leaders. It\u2019d be hard not to hear about him,\" said Han Sen.\n\n\"Awesome.\" Fang Jingqi smiled at Han Sen, \"Last time you treated me with a ritual, so today I have a gift for you. Not sure if you are interested.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t like gifts. Your visit has already made me a happy man.\" Looking at Xue Xi\u2019s upset face, Han Sen shook his head and said. He didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble and put her in a difficult place.\n\n\"A mutant beast soul. Are you still not interested?\" asked Fang Jingqi slowly.\n\n\" A mutant beast soul!\" Han Sen looked at him, slightly surprised. He immediately understood why Fang Jingqi had mentioned Fist Guy.\n\nFang Jingqi looked at Han Sen with faint smile, \"Let\u2019s go to the combat pit and have a fight. Regardless of the outcome, I will let Fist Guy give you a mutant beast soul. Sen, what do you think about this gift?\"\n\nIf it was up to Han Sen, he would definitely accept it. However, he knew Xue Xi wouldn\u2019t want him to fight her brother, so he just said, \"I can\u2019t accept the mutant beast soul. If you haven\u2019t eaten, I\u2019ll cook us dinner.\"\n\nFang Jingqi thought Han Sen did not believe him, so he picked up the comlink and dialed a number. Suddenly the holographic image of a hunk popped up. The hunk smiled at Fang Jingqi and said, \"Jingqi, it\u2019s been so long since we saw each other... \"\n\n\"Fist Guy, I need your help. I have a friend in Steel Armor Shelter and want you to take care of him. Would you give him a mutant beast soul?\" asked Fang Jingqi with a smile.\n\n\"If others asked me for this, I would tell them to f*#k off. Since it\u2019s you asking, just send your friend to me in the shelter. And remember you owe me one,\" replied Fist Guy.\n\nAfter hanging up, Fang Jingqi looked at Han Sen and asked, \"Now, are you willing to accept my gift?\""
