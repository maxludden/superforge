    "text": "Han Sen knew that he had shot himself in the foot. That King guard was aligned with the element of water, but that didn\u2019t imply affiliation with cold and yin force powers.\n\nThe fire element was known to restrict the water element, but under the right conditions, they could actually make each other more dangerous.\n\nLike a steam machine: with the aid of fire, water could be turned into high-pressure steam. Then it could apply a force of pressure. The guard attacking Han Sen obviously had that skill and power. The lava sea\u2019s temperature increased the power of the water AoE, making Han Sen\u2019s situation all the direr.\n\nThe water around Han Sen heated up and turned into high-pressure steam, restricting Han Sen\u2019s body all the more. And the heat was growing unbearable. It was like he had been thrown into a super high-pressure cauldron.\n\nIf Han Sen hadn\u2019t been running his powerful Jadeskin geno art, he would have been easily cooked by the King\u2019s area-of-effect.\n\n\u201cThese Kings are getting harder and harder to deal with,\u201d Han Sen whined in his heart, but he remained focused on the fight, using whatever powers he had at his disposal.\n\nThe fire crow beast soul from the systems of chaos made a fire halo AoE that would give Han Sen fire powers. It also increased his resistance to the fire element.\n\nIt was exactly the effect that Han Sen wanted, but regrettably, the beast soul was only Marquise class. The effect wasn\u2019t very pronounced, but it made him feel a little bit better.\n\nHe summoned the Metal Doll beast soul next. Although he didn\u2019t know what it was for, he was too desperate to worry about it. If it might help, it was being spawned.\n\nHan Sen had given the Demon Bug King Bai Semas to Han Yan and the others, in case they got into trouble. The bird\u2019s nest had been absorbed by the little red bird. Right now, Han Sen had no better defensive alternatives.\n\nThe Metal Doll was deployed, and a black halo that resembled teeth marks appeared around Han Sen\u2019s feet. When the wheel-like halo spun, Han Sen\u2019s body was covered in black metal.\n\nHan Sen felt as if his power had been given a boost, and his power element was now indestructible. There was a certain sharpness to all of his movements. When he swung his weapon, the steam binding him became much easier to tear through.\n\n\u201cDoes the Metal Doll halo increase the power and sharpness of the user?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t have the time to think it through. He gritted his teeth and dove deep into the lava sea.\n\nHan Sen had no way to return to the surface. He planned to head for the island that resided below the lava and see if he could find the group of rock dragons and that blue metal wolf. If he could manipulate them into entering the fight, he might have a chance of fighting back.\n\nHan Sen waved his Thunder God Spike to leave a wake of lightning behind him, but the lightning was useless inside that area-of-effect. The King class guard used his power to destroy the attack. It achieved naught.\n\nPang! A blow landed on Han Sen\u2019s body. Although the damage wasn\u2019t critical, streams of water were now flowing into his body and thumping in his vessels.\n\nHan Sen cast Spell\u2019s Eternity solidifying power. His blood solidified around the water in his body, prohibiting that power from spreading through his body.\n\nHan Sen incurred a few similar wounds, but they didn\u2019t strike any vital places. The King class guard was shocked. Although he hadn\u2019t yet landed a killing blow on Han Sen, he had been making use of a toxic geno art. Anyone who was struck by it would be lucky if they were only paralyzed. The poison could be deadly to King class opponents, yet a mere Duke was repelling it.\n\nAnd Han Sen was still able to fight him. He didn\u2019t look to be affected by the toxins, and that confused the guard.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He was so close to the island now, but he didn\u2019t see any rock dragons.\n\nAs he was thinking, a sense of lightness passed over Han Sen\u2019s body. He dropped out of the lava, entering that familiar space below. The King class guard entered right behind him. He saw the lava sky above and the island down below. He was shocked at the sight, and he murmured, \u201cWhat? The center of Planet King Kong has a place like this?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked over the lake. He couldn\u2019t see the blue metal wolf that was taking a bath anymore, either. And not a single rock dragon circled overhead. He felt sick, and he thought to himself, \u201cWhy am I so unlucky? None of them are here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen teleported again, drawing closer to the lake. He waved his Thunder God Spike to deflect the King class guard\u2019s attack and used his Dongxuan Aura to scan around like mad.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen noticed something blue below the surface of the lake. A relieved smile spread over his face.\n\nThe blue metal wolf was merely sleeping underwater.\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen let himself get hit by one of the guard\u2019s strikes. The blow sent him shooting down into the water like an arrow, and he swam straight to the blue metal wolf.\n\nThe King guard followed. Because Planet King Kong had no deified xenogeneics, he didn\u2019t think he had anything to be afraid of.\n\nBut when he entered the water, he woke up the sleeping blue metal wolf.\n\nWhen Han Sen entered the water, he was careful to hide his presence. He slipped lightly under the surface, like a gracefully diving acrobat. Han Sen even tried to suppress the splash to avoid creating a startling movement.\n\nBut the King class guard didn\u2019t care. He brought his AoE with him, blanketing half of the lake. The attack also fell over the blue metal wolf.\n\nThe sleeping wolf woke up in a fury. It stood up, its metallic fur standing on end. Then it howled.\n\nThe lake exploded like a freshwater spring as the howl blasted away the water. Han Sen curled up in fetal position, holding his weapon in front to protect himself. Even so, the shockwave was strong enough to blast him away with the rest of the lake water.\n\nLuckily, he was still wearing his Galactic Lobster Armor. It was a King class set of armor. If he hadn\u2019t been wearing it, the power unleashed by the blue metal wolf would have shattered every bone in his body.\n\n\u201cWhat amazing power! What is the level of this blue metal wolf?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nOn the other side, the King guard now looked horrified. He was frozen in the air, unmoving. The blue metal wolf was now standing in the dry lakebed, and its blue wolf eyes were peering right at him. The guard felt like he was being watched by the Grim Reaper himself, and his nerves were as tight as bowstrings. His body was shivering, and the only thing he wanted was to escape.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t dare try. He was sure that, if he turned around, the blue metal wolf would leap after him. The beast would chew him up and crunch his bones.\n\nThe lake water rained down softly. The man and the wolf looked at each other, and the King class guard\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat."
