    "text": "While the rainbow raged the bottle, the bottle itself started to float.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face paled. A bad feeling suddenly washed over him. He hastily backed away from the altar and returned to the blood kirin.\n\nLan Haixin was still staring at that shining Siren Bottle. Not recognizing the danger rising before her, she was still waiting for the Siren Bottle to select its master.\n\nWhen the other Sirens saw that the Siren Bottle had been activated, they knelt and began to bow before it. They also mumbled words Han Sen didn\u2019t understand. He assumed it was the language of the Siren.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe Siren Bottle\u2019s rainbow light exploded out. The bottle\u2019s halo expanded, looking like a pillar of light reaching for the top of the Crystal Palace.\n\nAfter the blurry rainbow touched the Crystal Palace\u2019s ceiling, it began to spread. It started to seep all across the Crystal Palace. The entire structure started to shine brightly, as if the whole thing had been doused in the morning light.\n\nThe altar\u2019s secret substance chain was affected by the blurry rainbow, too. It started to shine, as well. Many magical spells began to play across the top of the altar.\n\nLin Haixin finally noticed that something was wrong. They all turned to look at Han Sen. Lan Haixin abandoned the altar to ask Han Sen, \u201cBai Yi, what is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are asking me? How am I supposed to know? I told you earlier that there was a problem with this thing, but you guys chose to ignore the warning.\u201d Han Sen wanted to leave the Crystal Palace, but the main door had been barred by rainbow-colored light. Han Sen tried to open it a few times, but each attempt ended with him being tossed back by the power of those rainbows.\n\nAlthough the light fountained everywhere, it didn\u2019t hurt anyone. But Han Sen was unable to go out, and so he was still stuck there with the rest of them.\n\n\u201cYou and your mother planned this so you could trick us!\u201d the old Siren woman screamed, pointing at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen ignored her. She was obviously a moron, and there was no point in trying to understand her.\n\nThe Siren couldn\u2019t leave the hall. The old Siren woman pointed at Han Sen and said, \u201cGrab him! I don\u2019t believe that b*tch would leave her son behind.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stared at the idiotic old Siren woman for a long moment. \u201cAre you having a stroke or something?\u201d\n\nThe Siren still surrounded Han Sen, though, and he didn\u2019t know what they were thinking.\n\nThe half-deified old woman was their strongest member. The others were all King class. Han Sen\u2019s blood kirin had half-deified powers. He didn\u2019t understand how the old Siren woman could have thought that command was a good idea.\n\nThe Siren looked a little hesitant, though. They surrounded Han Sen, but they made no attempt to attack him.\n\n\u201cTake him! That is the only way we will survive,\u201d the old Siren woman screamed. She lifted her coral staff and gathered up a watery power. It became a water dragon that shot out towards the blood kirin.\n\nThe other Sirens moved to help the old Siren woman. They wanted to take Han Sen down together.\n\nThe blood kirin had a very short fuse. It spat out some blood air that destroyed the old Siren woman\u2019s water dragon, then it activated its blood area and stepped forward to attack the Sirens that surrounded them.\n\nHan Sen placed Lilly on the blood kirin\u2019s back, then touched the blood kirin\u2019s head. He shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to attack them. She\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Siren were given a shock. Han Sen was indicating the old woman.\n\nThe old Siren woman coldly grunted. \u201cEven now, you still try to divide us? You are evil. We were blind, and unable to tell you were this evil. You better tell us what conspiracy you and that b*tch cooked up. Don\u2019t be angry with us that we\u2019re about to harm a member of our own family.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the old Siren woman used her staff against the blood kirin.\n\nThe blood kirin roared in return and ran forward to fight the old Siren woman. The old Siren woman couldn\u2019t compete against the blood kirin, though. The area she created wasn\u2019t enough to block the pervasive blood area unleashed by the blood kirin. She was at an immediate disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Take them down! This is our only chance of living,\u201d the old Siren woman screamed.\n\nThe Siren Kings moved forward to fight, but Lan Haixin\u2019s face looked hesitant.\n\n\u201cLan Haixin, think about this. Who was the one that allowed you to open the relic? Who is the one that brought you here? Who was the one that said the bottle was the relic? Who was the one that provoked this fight?\u201d Han Sen shouted to Lan Haixin.\n\nHis hands clutched the head of the blood kirin. He wasn\u2019t going to allow the blood kirin to attack anyone aside from the old Siren woman.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t trying to be nice by sparing their lives. Instead, he was reasonably confident that the old Siren woman wanted him to kill all the Siren there.\n\nThis ploy was way too obvious. The old Siren woman knew that they would be unable to fight Han Sen and the blood kirin, so she was being stubborn. Han Sen didn\u2019t believe that this half-deified woman had survived the destruction of her race while remaining this stupid. That was, unless there was something she wanted.\n\nIf the old Siren woman really wanted to kill Han Sen, she would have attacked Han Sen herself. But her target was the blood kirin. This decision drove the blood kirin\u2019s bloodlust to even greater heights.\n\nThe whole of the Extreme King knew that the blood kirin was a cruel and ill-tempered beast. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have murdered someone in King\u2019s Garden.\n\nThe old Siren woman\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t natural. Even if she convinced the Siren to fight, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat Han Sen and the blood kirin. At the very best, they might achieve a draw. And that wouldn\u2019t be a very good result for the Siren. The only possibility was that the old Siren woman wanted to do harm to the Siren as a whole. It wasn\u2019t about him exclusively.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to be used as a tool to kill the Siren. That was why he held the blood kirin\u2019s head to keep it from killing them.\n\nBut the blood kirin\u2019s temper was too cruel. Han Sen couldn\u2019t control it. The blood kirin kept being provoked by the old Siren woman, and because of this, the blood air got scarier and scarier. The creature couldn\u2019t hold in its emotions.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d The blood kirin landed a blow on the old Siren woman. Her body flew away and crashed into one of the palace\u2019s crystal walls. She coughed up some blood.\n\n\u201cHoly Virgin, do you not understand? If we don\u2019t kill to survive, the Siren will all be murdered here and now. Bai Yi and his b*tch mother are going to ruin our race.\u201d The old Siren woman was covered in blood. Her hair was messed up, and it looked as if she was on the verge of crying.\n\nThe blood kirin didn\u2019t hesitate, though. It roared and went toward the old Siren woman. Han Sen couldn\u2019t stop it.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d Lan Haixin shouted. The Siren Kings moved to fight Han Sen and the blood kirin, too. They wanted to stop the blood kirin\u2019s advance."
