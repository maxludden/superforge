    "text": "Deep in the mountains on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen, Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and Little Silver, were traveling. After Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng became Viscounts, Little Silver became one, too.\n\nNow Han Sen was depressed. Little Angel, Zero, and he had not been infected. If they had, it was likely they could have leveled up to Viscount with much greater ease. They wouldn\u2019t have needed to practice half as much.\n\n\u201cThe environment is stable for now, at least. Why don\u2019t we bring more people to this universe, so we can grow and cultivate them? It will be impossible for us to become famous here with only a handful of people.\u201d Han Sen was deep in thought.\n\nHan Sen could recruit many from the Alliance, but there were a few he did not feel safe with. One such person was Wang Yuhang. Han Sen was afraid that if he came here, the man would bring terrible luck down on him.\n\nBecause Han Sen had provided many xenogeneic genes to his friends and followers, certain people in the sanctuaries had developed very quickly. But he had made sure to only provide such things to those who were close to him. Han Sen\u2019s resources were limited, and he couldn\u2019t fill the needs of everybody he knew.\n\nWith the help of xenogeneic genes, though, many humans and creatures from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary had made it to the Alliance. That included Dragon Lady, Death Goddess, Red Pony, and Little Star. They had successfully ascended to the Alliance universe.\n\nThe humans who had successfully ascended included Queen, Lin Feng, Wang Yuhang, Tang Zhenliu, and Yi Dongmu. They were waiting to go to the xenogeneic universe now.\n\nJi Yanran and Luolan had eaten so many xenogeneic genes that they too had ascended to the Alliance. But Han Sen wasn\u2019t yet willing to let them cross the divide. He was afraid that if they were there, they\u2019d cause a big problem for him with their attempts to find Littleflower.\n\nThe advantage of creatures from the sanctuaries was that they could level up rather quickly by consuming xenogeneic genes. Their biggest letdown, however, was the fact that their genes were unstable. There was no telling what a creature might eventually become.\n\nA xenogeneic that looked like a leopard came prowling out of the mountains. Gu Qingcheng, with her swordair, killed it in a single strike.\n\nGu Qingcheng\u2019s powers were of swordair and not swordlight. Her green swordair was weird, and it resembled something like silk. She could kill enemies at all manners of strange angles.\n\n\u201cSave me some!\u201d Xie Qing King blurted, clutching his silver book.\n\n\u201cYou are too slow,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said, as she was in the process of cutting up the xenogeneic body and harvesting the xenogeneic genes.\n\nXie Qing King did not say a word, and he merely closed his silver book.\n\nHan Sen looked at Xie Qing King. Xie Qing King\u2019s geno armament and power had been consistently surprising to Han Sen, and they had interested him quite a bit.\n\nAfter Xie Qing King leveled up to become a Viscount, he had been able to use his silver light to draw pictures on the pages of his book. Whatever he drew could come to life, right out of the parchment. He could practically summon beasts to fight alongside him.\n\nBut the shadows he drew did have limitations. For one thing, he couldn\u2019t pre-draw a creature, then cast it when the time for battle came. So, he had to draw his desired summons during battle, and that took time.\n\nWith Gu Qingcheng there, though, he couldn\u2019t draw anything fast enough to fight. By the time he finished drawing something, she\u2019d have killed the xenogeneic already. It was something that didn\u2019t make him very happy.\n\nHan Sen was happy, though. He wasn\u2019t interested in Baron or Viscount xenogeneics. He wanted to find light treasure.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Xie Qing King looked up to the mountain, confusion etched across his face. Han Sen followed Xie Qing King\u2019s gaze, and they examined a red mist hanging across the mountain.\n\nBut the mist hadn\u2019t come from the sky. It arose from the mountain itself, and it looked rather weird.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should go and take a look. There could be treasure!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes shone brightly.\n\n\u201cCareful. We are only Viscounts, remember. If we encounter a Duke or a Marquise, only Han Sen has a Duke beast soul pair of shoes that he can use to run. We lack such things,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said.\n\n\u201cDo I look like the type to run off and abandon you?\u201d Han Sen was hurt by the comments.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng answered sincerely.\n\nHan Sen shrugged his shoulders and picked up Little Silver. Carefully, he snuck towards the place he had seen.\n\nThe red mist was like a cloud, but it rippled like a living fire. It was a stunning sight.\n\nAfter the three of them got close, they found that the red mist was rising from a valley. The valley, filled up with that mist, looked like heaven. What might have lurked beyond the strange vapor, however, was something they could not see.\n\n\u201cShould we go in and take a look?\u201d Gu Qingcheng looked down into the valley and frowned.\n\nShe could not see anything. The red mist was too thick for their eyesight to penetrate. It didn\u2019t actually hurt their eyes, but it did stop them from looking at what was inside.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what lies inside. I\u2019d wager it is too dangerous to go in, though.\u201d Even with Teeth Rabbit shoes, Han Sen did not want to take the risk. He was still too weak, and carelessness could cost him his life.\n\n\u201cNow you can watch me.\u201d Xie Qing King spoke with absolute confidence. He summoned his silver book and began casting with his wonderful silver light. He was scribbling something rather quickly.\n\nWithin a second, the shadow of a silver leopard leaped out from the pages of the book. It looked exactly like the one Gu Qingcheng had just killed. This one was just a silver shadow, though. It wasn\u2019t comprised of actual flesh.\n\n\u201cYou can draw anything you like with this book?\u201d Han Sen asked with surprise.\n\n\u201cYes, but they only stay around temporarily for now. I can only draw creatures that exist in the universe, too. The drawing has to be pretty accurate to generate the creature, as well.\u201d After Xie Qing King said that, he commanded that the leopard head into the valley.\n\n\u201cIf you draw a King class xenogeneic, would it have King class power?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course not. The shadow\u2019s power depends on the caster\u2019s strength\u2014mine. That being said, some of the creatures I have drawn can carry their own element. Still, the power scales back in comparison to me,\u201d Xie Qing King explained.\n\n\u201cWhoa, that is already so very good!\u201d Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King strangely.\n\nXie Qing King was a man with a very bad temper. It was strange to see him take to drawing in a fight instead of immediately using his fists.\n\nRoar! The leopard had been inside the mist for a while when an awful screech was heard. Then, nothing. The valley returned to silence.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s face changed. The leopard drawing in the book was shattered.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Han Sen asked Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I have a connection with the shadow. I can feel what they feel, but I cannot see through their eyes. After he entered the mist, something killed him quickly,\u201d Xie Qing King said"
