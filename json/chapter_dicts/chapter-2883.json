He took a deep breath and accepted the heartwarming fragrance of home.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d Upon seeing Han Sen, Ling\u2019er ran over to him in search of a hug.\n\n\u201cLing\u2019er. Good Ling\u2019er. Let Dad kiss you.\u201d Han Sen picked up Ling\u2019er and kissed her on the head. He rubbed her face and commented on how spongey her cheeks felt.\n\n\u201cYou remembered to come back. If you were not yet back, Ling\u2019er was going to forget what you looked like.\u201d Ji Yanran rolled her eyes at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen picked up Ling\u2019er. He used his nose to rub hers as he said, \u201cLing\u2019er would not forget Dad. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\n\nLing\u2019er\u2019s eyes were wide open as she replied, \u201cLing\u2019er would never forget Dad, and Dad would never forget Ling\u2019er. Right?\u201d Han Sen held Ling\u2019er and said, \u201cOf course not. Ling\u2019er is daddy\u2019s baby. Daddy can forget everyone except for Ling\u2019er,\u201d Ling\u2019er was holding Han Sen\u2019s neck. With a squeaky voice, she asked, \u201cLing\u2019er and Daddy will be together forever, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cKindergarten is on a break. Mother said Ling\u2019er can go play.\u201d Ling\u2019er blinked and asked, \u201cCan you take me to the big universe to play?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Han Sen was surprised. It was now revealed that she was being so nice solely for the reason of Han Sen taking her out.\n\nHan Sen sighed. If this was before, he would have hesitated and outright refused to take Ling\u2019er to the big universe. It was too dangerous.\n\nNow, Han Sen had the power to protect himself, so he had the option to consider it.\n\n\u201cIf there is no danger, you should take her,\u201d said Ji Yanran, who was nearby. \u201cThe teacher gave her a lot of homework that requires the assistance of a parent. You never spend time with her. Take this as a trip to finish the homework.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? Out there, I have a place to stay. Bao\u2019er and Little Red Bird are there. I bet they miss Ling\u2019er a lot.\u201d Han Sen nodded. He looked at Ji Yanran and asked, \u201cAre you coming with\n\nus?!\n\n\u201cI am not going,\u201d Ji Yanran said. \u201cRecently, I have been researching Xuanmen skills. I have discovered something interesting. I want to achieve something with the Xuanmen skills first, then I will take Ling\u2019er to the universe. I will be living there from now on.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised. Xuanmen skills were a bit complicated and more than a bit boring. It was difficult for ordinary people to learn, and the results were never obvious. It was a skill that took a long time to learn. He was surprised to hear that Ji Yanran was interested in learning a Xuanmen skill.\n\nThe next morning, Han Sen took Ling\u2019er with him on his teleportation back to the universe. He said goodbye to Kong Fei and used Galaxy Teleportation to return to Space Garden.\n\nLing\u2019er was very good at adjusting. The universe\u2019s powerful pressure did not affect her. She was able to adjust to its environment pretty quickly. It was surprising. \u201cHow powerful is Ling\u2019er\u2019s body? When I just leveled up and came here, it took me a while to adjust to the pressure of this universe.\u201d Han Sen looked at Ling\u2019er with a strange expression. She was merrily jumping around. Her two pigtails were swinging.\n\nHan Sen was feeling cocky and said, \u201cI cannot blame her. After all, her daddy is the one-and-only Han Sen.\u201d\n\nThe Holy Baby was released by Han Sen again. With a look of depression, he waddled over to sit next to him.\n\nThere were not many changes in Space Garden, but there were many changes in the people there. Bao\u2019er, Little Red Bird, Little Angel, Zero, Huangfu Jing, Qin Xuan, Tang Zhenliu, and Wang Yuhang were all there.\n\nMost importantly, many people had already used the resources of Space Garden to become deified class. Aside from the few that showed up on the geno god list, Moment Queen and Little Star Star were deified too.\n\n\u201cThis is all because of Little Red Bird,\u201d Wang Yuhang excitedly said. \u201cIf it was not for him, we would not be able to start hunting plant xenogeneics so fast. We would not have as much geno fluid to use. By the way, this is such a great place. Deified xenogeneic plants are all over the place.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er pulled Ling\u2019er away to play elsewhere. Little Red Bird shook its butt and followed from behind. After following them for a bit, it went back. It flapped its wings and flew around Han Sen. It circled him a few times. It kept looking at him. It seemed as if he was searching for something.\n\n\u201cAre you looking for this?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He brought out the metal egg that Tai Yi had given to him.\n\nLittle Red Bird was excited and screamed. It flew over to Han Sen and opened its mouth, obviously wanting to eat the metal egg.\n\n\u201cI cannot give this to you yet.\u201d Han Sen smiled and put the egg back. Little Red Bird was disappointed.\n\nHe was not going to allow Little Red Bird to gobble it up before he figured out what the little metal egg did.\n\nSpace Garden was not very big right. They were mostly human creatures and spirits there. Their powers were not bad.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cIt looks like we can bring more interesting guys here. Space Garden has so many resources now. I can bring a few hundred more people and we\u2019ll still be fine.\u201d\n\nThe next place Han Sen planned on going to was the realm of the Buddha. He was still hesitant about choosing whether or not to challenge the Buddha and knock them down from being one of the higher races or just going to their lands and stealing the knife back.\n\nTaking down the Buddha was the best choice, but Han Sen did not want to do it as a human. If he used his crystallizer\u2019s name, he did not know if humans would benefit from the act.\n\nOrdinarily, after a race\u2019s lantern was lit, the creatures of the same race would receive a buff via the lantern. The genes in their bodies increased.\n\nHan Sen and the others were not pure crystallizers. If he used the name of the crystallizers to light up a lantern, he did not know what the outcome might be.\n\n\u201cSo far, the name of the crystallizers to light up the lantern might yield better results,\u201d Wang Yuhang said. \u201cThings about humans should not be too obvious. Plus, the ranking of the Buddha is low. It is not worth risking humans to take.\u201d\n\nEveryone thought using the name of the crystallizers to fight the Buddha was better. After seeing the geno god list, they knew their powers were much weaker than others in the universe. It was not enough for them to keep a grip on their throne. \u201cAlright.\u201d Han Sen nodded. He planned on using Dollar\u2019s identity for humans to light up a lantern. To do that, he was not going to select a low-tier race to target. He was going to make sure that when the humans were ready to make themselves known to the universe, they would immediately get into the top five.\n\nXi Qing King, Qin Xuan, and Han Sen were talking about the details. They confirmed that they would take down the Buddha as crystallizers and replace the lantern.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, you take good care of Ling\u2019er. Dad has some things to do.\u201d Han Sen gave Ling\u2019er to Bao\u2019er. He used Galaxy Teleportation to go where the Buddha were.\n\nUpon seeing Han Sen leave, Holy Baby looked very happy and had a murderous expression. He walked over to Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er, who were playing together."
