    "text": "The stone dragon dove toward the blue metal wolf\u2019s head, but Han Sen steadied his weapons and remained motionless.\n\nEven a skinny camel was still bigger than a horse. So, while the blue metal wolf had sustained terrible injuries, it still had plenty of strength. It wouldn\u2019t go down quickly. Therefore, Han Sen planned to let the stone dragon and the metal wolf duke it out for a while before initiating a strike of his own.\n\nThe stone dragon landed. Its area-of-effect covered the blue metal wolf, and stone markings appeared across the wolf\u2019s body.\n\nThe stone dragon apparently had a petrifying ability, and judging by its effects, the skill was far stronger than the stone cow\u2019s petrification.\n\nThe blue metal wolf hadn\u2019t reacted to Han Sen\u2019s petrifying shockwave, but the stone dragon\u2019s attack had scrawled stony markings across the wolf\u2019s body. The attack also seemed to sink deeper into the wolf\u2019s wounds, as stone started to build up and solidify around the creature\u2019s injuries.\n\nThe stone dragon\u2019s talons reached out to seize the wolf\u2019s neck.\n\nThe blue metal wolf had been keeping its head low. It didn\u2019t use a King class area-of-effect of its own, but when the stone dragon\u2019s talons closed in, the wolf raised its head.\n\nThe stone dragon\u2019s talons slammed into the wolf\u2019s face, but the blue metal creature had no reaction. The dragon\u2019s talons were unable to pierce the wolf\u2019s skin.\n\nKatcha! The blue metal wolf bit into the stone dragon\u2019s wings with enough force to rip them right off.\n\nHan Sen watched in shock as the stone dragon screamed. The blue metal wolf didn\u2019t make a sound; it simply went wild with its claws and fangs. A moment later, the King class stone dragon was torn open by the blue metal wolf. King class blood sprayed everywhere.\n\nOnce the stone dragon was ripped open, the blue metal wolf stopped and its stone markings faded. The powers of the stone dragon no longer seemed to have an effect on the wolf.\n\nThe metal wolf tore further into the dragon\u2019s body, finding and ripping out the dragon\u2019s petrifying spine. Han Sen figured it was the dragon\u2019s xenogeneic gene. The beast chewed it a little, then swallowed it with a single gulp. Without sparing the body of the stone dragon a second glance, the wolf walked away.\n\nHan Sen was stunned. The blue metal wolf hadn\u2019t even used a King class area-of-effect, and it had still slain the King class stone dragon with ease. The strength it possessed was both terrifying and disconcerting.\n\nHan Sen had initially wanted to take advantage of the wolf\u2019s injured state, but after seeing the ferocity of the beast, he gave up on the idea.\n\n\u201cThis guy must be a mutant King class xenogeneic,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t understand. The blue metal wolf was very strong, and it had displayed its strength during its brief battle with the stone dragon.\n\nThe King class stone dragon had been unable to puncture the metal body of the wolf. And after being petrified, the wolf had been able to recover. That meant it possessed impressive healing powers.\n\nThat was a scary xenogeneic by any metric. It had wounds that it couldn\u2019t heal, though. It continued to bleed, which made Han Sen wonder how it had ended up in such a state.\n\nAccording to the information he was able to gather on Knight\u2019s Paradise, deified creatures did exist there. But it was unheard of for them to reside on Planet King Kong.\n\n\u201cIs Planet King Kong home to deified xenogeneics that have yet to be discovered?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He could probably handle himself against King class xenogeneics, but it would be impossible for him to go up against a deified being.\n\nSeeing the blue metal wolf proceed to travel deeper into the desert, Han Sen hesitated for a moment. Ultimately, he decided to follow the blue metal wolf. He wanted to see where the wolf was going.\n\nHan Sen thought that if the blue metal wolf was truly dying, he might still have a chance to claim its spoils once it gave up the ghost.\n\nThe blue metal wolf kept walking through the desert. It moved slowly despite its strength, which was something that Han Sen wouldn\u2019t underestimate now that he had seen the beast in action. If it wanted to move faster, it certainly could.\n\nWherever the blue metal wolf went, every xenogeneic other than the stoneflies fled. Nothing wanted to be anywhere near the giant wolf.\n\nThe stoneflies stayed close, however. They gathered near the blue metal wolf and swarmed it, covering its wounds and drinking its blood.\n\nThe blue metal wolf didn\u2019t plan on killing them. It continued on its way, proceeding deep into the far reaches of the desert.\n\nHan Sen followed it for seventy-to-eighty universal hours. Eventually, the blue metal wolf came to a stop.\n\nThe valley in front of them was grand but also in disarray, and no water coursed through its stone. Instead, a flow of lava coursed through the valley. The blue metal wolf observed the stream of lava for a moment, then leaped right into the lava.\n\nSplash!\n\nThe blue metal wolf jumped into the lava, sending out waves that were dozens of meters high. The lava splashed across the shores of the stream, and it released plumes of black smoke and fire as it landed.\n\nHan Sen flew slowly around the large valley. After the blue metal wolf jumped into the lava, it quickly disappeared. It was as if the beast had drowned, for he could no longer see it.\n\n\u201cWeird. The blue metal wolf didn\u2019t look like it was attuned to the element of fire. There is no way that the lava is his natural home. But if not, then what would bring him here? Perhaps the creature really did think that it was dying, so it wanted to end things here by jumping into the lava to prevent others from eating its remains? That can\u2019t be right. There must be xenogeneics in the lava. The wolf can\u2019t keep its body in the lava forever\u2026\u201d Han Sen thought this was very weird.\n\nHan Sen looked around, and he eventually saw that the lava was home to stony-looking snakes. They didn\u2019t go close to where the blue metal wolf had jumped in, though.\n\nThis didn\u2019t really have anything to do with Han Sen, but he was simply curious. His desire to figure out what was going on was like an itch that he couldn\u2019t scratch. He didn\u2019t want to just leave.\n\nHan Sen killed a xenogeneic nearby while waiting for the blue metal wolf to re-emerge. He didn\u2019t stray too far from where the wolf had disappeared.\n\nAlmost four days went by, and the lava stream stayed quiet. It made Han Sen feel depressed.\n\nHan Sen wanted to dive into the lava and take a closer look, but he couldn\u2019t make up his mind.\n\nMany xenogeneics lived in that land of lava, but none of them dared to go to that one specific area. Perhaps they were scared of the blue metal wolf, or maybe something even stranger was down there.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Marquise hunted. Rock Snake: xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen killed a Rock Snake, as there weren\u2019t many other xenogeneics around. This was the last xenogeneic he could find to kill, and it was only a Marquise.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and went back to the zone of lava. He surmised that waiting there was a waste of time, so he now had to choose between two options. He could leave that place and continue hunting, or he could enter the lava and take a look.\n\nBecause of his curiosity, Han Sen went with the second option. He donned his Galactic Lobster Armor and activated his Dongxuan Aura, then dunked his head into the lava."
