    "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t think I really understand. Please explain it to me again,\u201d Han Sen said, trying to keep his shock from showing on his face.\n\nTruthfully, Han Sen understood the geno art perfectly. The geno art was quite familiar to him, and that familiarity shook him to his core. The geno art had an obvious connection to the Dongxuan Sutra. Both arts could benefit each other quite well, and using Mister White\u2019s technique could aid in the development of the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nHan Sen could use the Dongxuan Sutra to absorb power from the world around him. Doing so allowed him to conserve his own energy, stretching his strength out over a longer period of time.\n\nBut the Dongxuan Sutra had yet to reach Duke, so the effect wasn\u2019t particularly good. It only saved Han Sen a small amount of power.\n\n\u201cHas Mister White realized that I use the Dongxuan Sutra? Is that why he\u2019s telling about this geno art? What is he planning?\u201d Han Sen thought fast, but he didn\u2019t have enough information to guess what Mister White was playing at.\n\nIt seemed likely that Mister White knew that Han Sen could use the Dongxuan Sutra. Explaining a geno art as simply as he had suggested that the man\u2019s mind was quite frightening. It put Han Sen on red alert.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me repeating myself, I will recite the geno art again.\u201d Mister White smiled. Then, he resumed talking about the geno art.\n\nIt would have been better if he had stopped speaking there, for the more he talked, the more confused Crime became. Mister White\u2019s detailed explanation of the geno art was more difficult to understand than the geno art itself. He began speaking about the geno universe itself, which was something Crime had never heard about before.\n\nHan Sen used the Dongxuan Aura to listen, and he was able to understand a bit. He pretended that he couldn\u2019t though, and he feigned confusion.\n\n\u201cMister White, I\u2019m afraid that the explanation isn\u2019t helping. I am just getting more and more confused.\u201d Han Sen presented Mister White with a wry smile.\n\n\u201cMister White is so smart. Since you\u2019re just a Duke, well, it is only expected that you can\u2019t understand a word that he\u2019s saying. And don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t understand, either. It isn\u2019t about you, okay?\u201d Crime said.\n\nMister White shook his head and sighed. \u201cThe things I have learned are a bit different from your own geno art. It is okay that you don\u2019t understand, but try to learn as much as you can, for I can only explain it here like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for your willingness to teach me. I\u2019m just afraid I will never be able to learn such a geno art,\u201d Han Sen said. But he was secretly casting the geno art Mister White had just taught him.\n\nHe gave it a try, and it worked fine. When Han Sen didn\u2019t summon his Dongxuan Armor, the effect of absorbing external power seemed to increase. And this was Han Sen\u2019s very first time using the ability. If the ability was already useful, then it would surely become a greater and greater benefit to him as his proficiency increased.\n\nHan Sen still didn\u2019t know why Mister White had given him the geno art, but he was okay with learning something new. Han Sen practiced it, and the strain of maintaining the Four Symbols Seal decreased.\n\nThe day went by pretty quickly. After the first twenty-four hours, the other deified xenogeneic clones shifted slightly toward Han Sen and the others like the very hungry monsters that they were.\n\nThe monsters stared at them for a whole day, and the beasts\u2019 eyes were different than they had been. There was a fresh, murderous gleam in their eyes.\n\nThe scary creatures looked over them, as if deciding which flavor of meat to dine on first. The slavering beasts made Han Sen and the others nervous. But even so, despite all the attention directed toward them, not a single one of the xenogeneics prepared to attack. They just stared at Han Sen\u2019s group like jewels.\n\nAcknowledging their apparent safety, Han Sen and the others felt relieved. It was fortunate that the jade cat statue hadn\u2019t lied to them. The deified clones really were restraining themselves, as the cat statue had said.\n\nHan Sen and the others didn\u2019t dare move, though. They continued using their strength to keep the bai sema going. They kept the deified xenogeneic clone sealed, hoping they could hold the creature there for the entire ten days.\n\nBut as time ticked by, the xenogeneic clone\u2019s struggling became worse and worse. After it had been thrashing around for a while, Han Sen started to feel a strain.\n\nFive days later, even the half-deified blood kirin was beginning to fatigue.\n\nBecause each part of the Four Symbols Seal was connected, Han Sen didn\u2019t have to continually use his full power. It meant that the others had to pick up his weight, though, to keep the deified xenogeneic suppressed.\n\nSo, the blood kirin and Mister White were using up a lot more power than Han Sen was.\n\nSweat began to trickle down Crime\u2019s forehead. It was getting hard for him, too.\n\nThings were not going as well as they had hoped. But by Han Sen\u2019s estimation, if they continued using power at the same rate, they would survive all ten days of the trial.\n\n\u201cLittle guys, you seem to be working very hard. I have to say, you\u2019re not doing a bad job.\u201d Suddenly, the jade cat statue started talking again. It spoke lazily, though, as if it had just woken up from a deep slumber.\n\nHan Sen and the others were concentrating all their strength on maintaining the Four Symbols Seal, however. They couldn\u2019t spare the time or effort to bother looking in the direction of the jade cat statue.\n\nThe jade cat statue\u2019s voice came from behind them again. \u201cYou guys are doing good, but don\u2019t you think that this would be a boring way to pass the test?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to cheat, are you?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. If the jade cat statue let the rest of the xenogeneics attack them, they would be very dead.\n\nThe jade cat statue laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I cannot change the rules that Sacred Leader set in place. I just wanted to give you a small surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate surprises,\u201d Han Sen said with a tight, feral smile.\n\n\u201cBut this really is a surprise. It might actually prove to be a great benefit to you guys. Of course, you will need to have what it takes to accept the surprise.\u201d The jade cat statue looked as if it was smiling, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAfter the cat statue\u2019s voice trailed off, Han Sen heard a noise coming from the ground. It sounded like something was dragging metal chains.\n\nHan Sen scanned around them with his Dongxuan Aura, and then he noticed as all the deified clones began stepping away from them. Something new was approaching Han Sen\u2019s group.\n\nIt was a skeleton. Or at least, it looked like a skeleton. The flesh of the creature had dried into a withered husk. Its long hair was like tufts of hay.\n\nThe being wasn\u2019t dead, though. His limbs were bound by metal cuffs, and he walked very slowly. With every step the man took, chains grated across the ground behind him.\n\nThe chained man was approaching them with his head lowered. When he got closer, Han Sen could see that there were two dark holes where his eyes should have been. Dark blood wept from the holes, and the eyes were missing.\n\nHan Sen and the others looked grim. They were using their powers to cast the Four Symbols Seal. If the creepy man attacked them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to block the strike without releasing the Four Symbols Seal. And that would be enough to lead to their doom.\n\nThe prisoner came within ten meters of them, chains rasping across the ground with every step. He raised his head so that the two bloody holes could peer at Han Sen and the others. Those two holes gave them the willies.\n\nHe stopped for a moment, but then, the prisoner started to move again. His slow steps took him toward Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201d Han Sen thought frantically. There were four of them, but the prisoner had decided to go for Han Sen. It was getting closer, and after another minute, it stood right behind him."
