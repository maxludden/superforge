    "text": "Yisha pursued an investigation of The Story of Genes. Revising something so complicated was difficult, and could even yield dangerous results. But if no changes were made to it, learning it would be too hard.\n\nRaising Han Sen to Duke level would be easy, and the resource costs would not be too hefty. But The Story of Genes made things far more complicated than she had anticipated. And raising Han Sen to Duke had been far more expensive than she expected.\n\nThere was nobody around, except for a few guards outside the tunnel\u2019s entrance.\n\nBut Narrow Moon had a lot of people watching the exit, and that included the Kings. They wanted to know more about the student Knife Queen had accepted. They wanted to know what made him so impressive that Queen herself would raise him.\n\nThey were different from the ordinary Rebate. They did not believe Knife Queen would spend so much time and resources on some random noob. They were guessing Knife Queen wanted Han Sen\u2019s deified feather. And although one deified feather could not make you deified, it had deified genes. It could still help semi-deify an elite.\n\n\u201cLook at the time! They should almost be out by now.\u201d Inside the garden, one Rebate King was looking at the exit, talking to himself.\n\nThe black vortex flashed suddenly, and someone came out. The Rebate who were watching the exit looked shocked, seeing this person.\n\n\u201cWhy is it Gauss?\u201d Everyone was surprised.\n\nOf the ten Barons that had entered, Gauss should have placed much higher. He could have been in the top five, or even the top three. But for someone like him to be the first one out, it was quite the surprise.\n\nEveryone looked at the weapon Gauss had taken. It was the pirate knife. Its power had been unleashed as it left the tunnel. And the Nobles could see that it was a Viscount weapon.\n\n\u201cJust a Viscount?\u201d Many people were disappointed by Gauss\u2019 performance. Especially the one who had recommended him. \u201cYou are injured! You need healing.\u201d The guards saw Gauss\u2019 neck wounds.\n\nMany of the elites felt as if something was amiss. The seventh knife rain should be happening about now. Gauss had a Viscount weapon, and he could have lasted another two rounds. There had to be a reason why he had come out now.\n\nEveryone looked at Gauss\u2019 wounds, and when they saw them, they were all in shock.\n\nObviously, the cuts had been created by Teeth Knife. They were not infected by the Teeth power, but you could tell they had been created by the Teeth Knife\u2019s Tusk component.\n\n\u201cGauss was injured by Han Sen!\u201d Everyone was taken aback.\n\nOut of the ten Barons inside, it was likely Han Sen was the only one that knew about Teeth Knife. It could only have been Han Sen who had hurt him.\n\nA King that was sitting in the hall, watching the tunnel, looked strangely at the scene. \u201cIt looks like the outsider students are not simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he had struck any deeper, Gauss would be dead! No Baron should have the control and skill to be this precise! How long have you been teaching him?\u201d Moon-Wheel King frowned.\n\nEven Yisha looked shocked, seeing the wounds on Gauss\u2019 neck.\n\nShe had taught Han Sen only once, for a few days. Han Sen had used Tusk to defeat Gauss, but at the same time spare his life. Her student was better than she believed him to be.\n\n\u201cJust a few days, and he is capable of this? Is he really that talented?\u201d Yisha thought to herself.\n\nAs time passed, more and more Barons emerged. Han Sen was not amongst the ones that exited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the tenth rain and they still haven\u2019t come out?\u201d Moon-Wheel King frowned.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Moon-Wheel King who was this surprised, either. Other Kings and Nobles were still surprised to see that Han Sen had not yet come out.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t died in there, it was interesting to consider the prospects of why he had not yet returned.\n\n\u201cI am sorry Dark-Moon King\u2026 I have disappointed you.\u201d In the hall, Gauss kowtowed before a King and looked very embarrassed.\n\n\u201cHan Sen hurt you?\u201d Dark-Moon King said coldly.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Gauss did not dare to lie.\n\n\u201cTell me what happened, and don\u2019t skip a single detail. No lying,\u201d Dark-Moon King said. He looked fairly calm.\n\nGauss\u2019 body shook as he explained what had happened.\n\nDark-Moon King frowned upon hearing the story. \u201cJust one hit? Knife Queen really put everything into that outsider.\u201d\n\nThe rumors about Black Steel killing an outsider began to propagate, but no one spoke a word about it. Even the elders that had recommended the outsider did not comment on it.\n\nHe had said something he was not supposed to, and Black Steel killed him for it. He had it coming. If Knife Queen heard what he had said, his fate would have been far worse.\n\nEveryone wondered why Han Sen and Black Steel still hadn\u2019t come out. Seven of them had exited, and only those two were still living inside there.\n\n\u201cIf they haven\u2019t come out, then that means they managed to make it through the eleventh round. If they are lucky enough, they might be able to find a Duke weapon.\u201d Yisha smiled. Han Sen\u2019s performance far exceeded her modest expectations.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s performance, if she wanted to invest in him, she\u2019d undoubtedly take less pressure for the decision. Black- Moon King was also happy that Black Steek was still going on. The other Kings and elders felt differently, though. No one knew what they were thinking about.\n\nIn Knife Grave, Han Sen and Black Steel were scaling a mountain. They were looking for higher-tier weaponry. Black Steel looked happy, as he took off running towards a knife he had spotted."
