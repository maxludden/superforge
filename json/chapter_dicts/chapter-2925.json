He spoke to himself sadly.\n\nThe ability to get a beast soul or not was something Han Sen could not control. As for what the chances were, he did not know yet.\n\nAccording to what God told him, God Spirits and beast souls had to have been composed of the spirits of creatures. Every creature had a spirit, so why was it that one could only get beast souls by killing xenogeneics in the universe? Why was a beast soul not given every time? Han Sen did not understand the reasons behind all of that.\n\nIf every xenogeneic had a spirit, then killing a xenogeneic should have definitely yielded a beast soul. But it wasn\u2019t like that.\n\n\u201cThis Dead Area Demon Dragon\u2019s deified xenogeneic gene should be enough to get my deified gene tally up to 100, but this guy is too big. I do not know how long it will take me to eat it all.\u201d Han Sen looked at the dragon\u2019s body, which looked like a giant rock. It made a wry smile develop on his face.\n\nAlthough his Consume was at the highest level, swallowing such a big dragon body would still take a long time. He would have to spend 10 days to half a month eating it.\n\n\u201cThe black dragon is dead. I wonder if there are any other treasures to find on the three black mountains.\u201d Han Sen raised his hand and held the stone lantern high. He was still feeling a bit greedy. He called Bao\u2019er and put her in a blanket. The two of them headed up the three black stone mountains.\n\nThey did not find any treasure. In the center of the three mountains, there was a circular valley. At the bottom of the valley was an old teleporter. It was unknown where it led.\n\nHan Sen did not know where the teleporter went, so he did not want to try it. He had to leave the valley and play with the stone lantern he had.\n\nThe stone lantern was strange. Han Sen could not activate its power and or control it. If he put his power through the fire, the flames imbued strength into the power he passed through it. It did not matter what power went through the flames. Any power was boosted. That was true for anyone who used it.\n\n\u201cWhat is this stone lantern? It does not look like a god personality armament, and it does not look like a xenogeneic treasure. It kind of looks like a race lantern from the geno hall, but it is not quite the same as them either.\u201d Han Sen studied the lantern for a while. He was still unable to find out what the stone lantern was.\n\nIf it was safe to use, Han Sen was not going to research it too much. He put it inside Destiny\u2019s Tower and went to start eating the Dead Area Demon Dragon\u2019s flesh.\n\nAfter he took a few bites, he saw a gold and red light appear in the sky. The big goldfish was flying toward him. It had brought the little goldfish along.\n\nBecause the big goldfish had not lied, and Han Sen had maxed out his genes after eating the Dead Area Demon Dragon, he was not planning on killing either goldfish.\n\nWhen it saw the body of the Dead Area Demon Dragon, the big goldfish looked very excited. It brought the little goldfish before Han Sen and kept firing bubbles as if it was trying to say something.\n\nBao\u2019er translated the bubbles. \u201cIt says thank you for killing the Dead Area Demon Dragon for it. He and his child appreciate it a lot. If the chance ever arises, it wants to return the favor someday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, you need to pay me back. Just show up whenever I need you,\u201d Han Sen said to the goldfish and its kid.\n\nThe goldfish family seemed to understand Han Sen\u2019s words and nodded. The big goldfish spat out many bubbles at Han Sen. After that, it swam to the top of the three black mountains. It turned its head and fired many more bubbles to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIt said the Dead Area Demon Dragon is dead,\u201d Bao\u2019er said. \u201cNow, the child can finally be returned home. It wants to invite us to its house.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the big goldfish with curiosity and asked, \u201cYour home would not happen to reside on the other side of the teleporter, would it?\u201d\n\nThe big goldfish nodded. It spat out many bubbles. Bao\u2019er tried to explain. \u201cIt said its home is on the other side of the teleporter. Something that happened many years ago was the whole reason it teleported to this place. Then, the Dead Area Demon Dragon took over the teleporter. They have been unable to go back. Now that you have killed the Dead Area Demon Dragon, they are finally able to go home. So, they are really grateful. They want you to go and visit them. They will also reward you with some more treasures too.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I don\u2019t mind going there.\u201d Upon hearing there was treasure to be found, Han Sen stopped hesitating. He put the Dead Area Demon Dragon meat inside Destiny\u2019s Tower and followed the big goldfish into the teleporter.\n\nHe now understood it completely. People said fish only had a seven-second memory. Whether or not it was true was unknown. This big goldfish was a top-class deified xenogeneic. Its intelligence and memory were not so good.\n\nHan Sen estimated its intelligence and did not think it was able to lie to people. So, he was not too worried.\n\nHe held onto Bao\u2019er and followed after the big and small goldfishes to the teleporter. The big goldfish\u2019s body released a red light. The light went into the teleporter. The teleporter was activated. It started to glow.\n\nHan Sen felt as if his eyes had gone black. When his vision returned to normal, he was no longer in the snowfields. It was all dark upfront.\n\nThere was no space. There was no hint of the universe around. There was no land, and there were no mountains. It was like nothing. It was just a pitch-black void. In front of that black nothingness, there was a broken stone door. That door only had two broken stone pillars left. The stone of the roof was broken. He saw half of a sign hanging on the broken roof. There was a lamp in front of the door. It was releasing some obscenely dim yellow light. Han Sen only saw half of the sign, which said the word \u201choly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this place a ruin that belonged to Sacred?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He was not able to think of any other race that would dare use the word \u201choly\u201d aside from Sacred.\n\nThe big goldfish led the small goldfish toward the broken door. The big goldfish looked very confused. It seemed as if it did not recognize the place.\n\nHan Sen held Bao\u2019er and followed. Before the big goldfish walked in front of the door, it saw the door released some cold light. The big goldfish was not prepared. It was shot in the forehead. Blood was everywhere. It was like a very sharp arrow pierced into the big goldfish\u2019s forehead. Although the arrowhead did not go deep, it broke the big goldfish\u2019s protective substance chains. That arrow was very strong.\n\n\u201cHow dare you come to Sacred! Do you guys want to die?\u201d A very dim voice came from the left side of the stone pillar. They then saw someone walk out from behind the stone pillar.\n\nThat someone, who had a human body and a dog face, was holding a teethy bow. There were three teethy arrows on the person\u2019s back. The person reached out a hand. The teeth arrow lodged in the big goldfish\u2019s head flew back into the person\u2019s hands. The wound on the big goldfish ripped. Blood came out with the arrow. It could not be stopped."
