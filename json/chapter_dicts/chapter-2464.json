    "text": "The small print broke the world shocking king print. And after that, it continued on its course towards Meng Lie. The print didn\u2019t become any bigger, but it did seem like the world was becoming smaller instead, shrinking under the twisted power of the print. The influence of the print seemed to spread over everything around them.\n\nMeng Lie\u2019s jaw tightened. Several gold substance chains flew from his body, assembling themselves into a big hand that was poised to strike back against the little print. But the big hand broke when it came into contact with that print. All the substance chains snapped, too. It was impossible to repel the power of that small print.\n\nSeeing that the little print was about to suppress him, Meng Lie shouted. Golden light burst from him. His body turned gold as his muscles expanded, and his armor buckled and broke as his body grew too large for it to contain.\n\nIn the next second, Meng Lie\u2019s hand gripped the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon\u2019s head. The gold of his body affected the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon, and the dragon began turning gold as well.\n\nMeng Lie roared. He was holding the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon up. He lifted it, like a dancing ant holding up an elephant.\n\nMeng Lie heaved the dragon toward the small World Print that was headed his way, and when the dragon left his hands, it became a draconic lance. It struck the small World Print, and it managed to knock the small World Print away.\n\nHan Sen was shocked by this, and he wondered, \u201cWhat kind of power is this? A deified xenogeneic turned into a lance?\u201d\n\nThe woman looked at Meng Lie in surprise. \u201cThe weapon part of Geno World Speech used in conjunction with Bloodline Spirit Body metal element. They can be combined? It looks like these slaves have something decent in them, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? This is my Extreme King\u2019s Golden Soldier King Body. Geno World Speech? You are full of crap\u2026\u201d Meng Lie snarled. Then he swung the gold dragon lance at the woman.\n\nThe gold dragon lance was burning with purple dragon fire. The dragon lance\u2019s metal slid forward, ripping the fabric of space as it appeared in front of the woman.\n\nThe woman looked at the gold dragon lance with interest. She summoned a small World Print in front of her to block the gold dragon lance.\n\nThe print was small, but as far as the lance was concerned, the print might as well have been as big as a planet. No matter how scary the lance\u2019s dragon fire was, it was drawn magnetically to the print. The attack couldn\u2019t go past the woman\u2019s shield.\n\nMeng Lie kept his grip on the heart of the gold dragon. He continued to roar and sprint forward with the gold dragon lance, thrusting it into the little World Print. The lance\u2019s dragon firepower kept being driven into the small print spell.\n\n\u201cGet lost!\u201d When Meng Lie roared, the gold dragon lance finally pierced through the small print. It exploded, and then space cracked.\n\nThe gold dragon lance roared with Meng Lie, and it shot forward toward the woman\u2019s eyebrow.\n\nThe woman looked shocked, and she didn\u2019t move. The raging dragon fire of the gold lance punched a hole straight through her skull.\n\nBut her body simply exploded. And then, the body of another woman appeared behind Meng Lie.\n\n\u201cMoon doppelganger and teleportation?\u201d Han Sen was frozen by the sight. This was the first time he had seen another person fight like this. The woman\u2019s moon doppelganger was a little different from Han Sen\u2019s, but it was based on the same concept. However, the woman\u2019s moon doppelganger was clearer, and her teleportation didn\u2019t cause a ripple in space. It wasn\u2019t like when Han Sen used his dragon wings and gathered up power. The woman\u2019s enemies would have no warning that she was about to teleport. Not until she appeared behind them, at least.\n\n\u201cWhat a scary woman. If I could teleport like that, I would have a much higher chance of success when fighting strong enemies.\u201d It had been a long time since Han Sen had made use of Break Space Flash with his dragon wings. It was still teleportation, but its range was too short and it took too long to cast. It wasn\u2019t suitable for King class fights.\n\nAfter all, the dragon wings were a mutant Marquise xenogeneic gene. It couldn\u2019t keep up with the needs of a King class battle.\n\nMeng Lie reacted quickly. He flipped the gold dragon lance, and the lance fire was like a roaring gold dragon as it headed for the woman behind him.\n\nPang!\n\nThe woman\u2019s body broke again, but she appeared next to Meng Lie, muttering to herself, \u201cI underestimated this race of slaves. This Gold Soldier King Body is quite interesting.\u201d\n\nMeng Lie\u2019s eyes were on fire. He couldn\u2019t bear listening to her. He looked like some deranged demon god as he swung the gold dragon lance. Anything the lance touched was incinerated by the fire it carried.\n\nThe sea of clouds was vaporized, and substance chains of gold dragon fire roared across the sky.\n\n\u201cThese deified elites are too strong. Meng Lie is forcing another deified creature to be his weapon. He\u2019s wielding it like any other weapon. And the woman is practically fighting two deified elites.\u201d Han Sen felt lust rise inside him as he watched the display of power. If he could gain that power and a group of deified creatures at his disposal, no one could defeat him.\n\nAgainst the rampaging gold dragon lance, the woman could only use clones and her ability of teleportation to fight.\n\nBut Han Sen could still tell that the woman had some extra tricks up her sleeve. She wasn\u2019t trying to escape; more than anything, it looked as if she was admiring his Gold Soldier King Body.\n\nMeng Lie noticed this, too. In his fury, he sped up his attacks even more. The substance chains were like dragon fire chewing up the sky and the daytime. He wanted to grind the woman into dust.\n\nBut his efforts were futile. The woman\u2019s teleportation capabilities were so good, it was like she had a frameshift drive installed. She shifted position so fast that it seemed like she was everywhere at once. It didn\u2019t matter how strong Meng Lie was because he couldn\u2019t touch a single hair upon her head.\n\nMeng Lie was unable to touch the woman. His eyes opened wide, and he began thrusting the gold dragon lance toward the island. The lance fire became a roaring gold dragon that came for the island. It looked like one bite was all it would take to devour the entire island.\n\nThe lantern was still on the island, and it was glowing red. It protected the island, but the red light couldn\u2019t withstand the lance\u2019s power forever. The lance\u2019s fire broke the red light, and the dragon fire covered the sky and the earth.\n\nHan Sen suddenly felt very anxious. This was the power of two deified beings doing battle. Perhaps the island could withstand it, but Han Sen and the wooden house wouldn\u2019t be able to. The wooden house held many geno arts, too, and they were at risk of being destroyed.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t overly concerned about them, though. Having a bunch of great geno arts would be useless if he died. He turned around and started to leave the house, but the dragon fire suddenly disappeared.\n\nHe raised his head. The gold dragon lance had stopped moving. It was hanging over the island, and the woman\u2019s bare, pale feet rested lightly atop the weapon.\n\n\u201cNice timing.\u201d Meng Lie had been unable to hit the woman, and so he had decided to strike the island instead. Now that the woman was where he wished her to be, the gold substance chains danced. The gold dragon lance was imbued with gold fire. It roared like a giant dragon, and it prepared to lash out at her.\n\n\u201cGold Soldier King Body, huh? Now I understand.\u201d The woman still stood upon the lance. She smiled faintly.\n\nAs the lance\u2019s gold dragon fire exploded, a white light surrounded her feet. The light was contagious, and it infected the gold dragon lance. The gold dragon lance changed color, transforming into a white metal dragon lance.\n\nPang!\n\nThe woman\u2019s bare feet stood firmly upon the lance, and then, the white dragon lance exploded with a dragon light. It blasted Meng Lie, and he let go of the weapon.\n\nThe white dragon lance flew away from him, then spun and landed in the woman\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cImpossible! How do you have the Gold Soldier King Body?\u201d Meng Lie stared at the woman who was holding the dragon lance. It was like he had seen a ghost."
