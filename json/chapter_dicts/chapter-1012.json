They stood where they were, trembling in fear of something else.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them now?\u201d Chen Hu wondered, with a look of confusion.\n\n\u201cOh, no! Run!\u201d When Lin He discovered the unseen menace, he did not delay a single second.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Han Sen shook his head and peered into the darkness of the forest.\n\n\u201cWhat is too late?\u201d Chen Hu asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wolf king,\u201d Lin Weiwei said.\n\n\u201cWhat about them? Wasn\u2019t Han Sen just killing them?\u201d Chen Hu\u2019s mouth had always been a little faster than his brain, and he was content to remain that way. He had never been fond of thinking.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the real king. Have you ever seen a pack with five kings before?\u201d Lin Weiwei said.\n\n\u201cNo. A wolf pack should only have one king; the alpha.\u201d Upon finishing his sentence, Chen Hu\u2019s face remained still in thought. A few seconds later, it dropped.\n\nIf those wolves weren\u2019t the actual kings, then the real one had to be above sacred-blood class. It might be a super creature.\n\nHaving now realized what was going on, Chen Hu\u2019s face looked glum.\n\nA giant wolf emerged from the shadows of the charred trees. It was purple and without lightning; it looked like any ordinary wolf.\n\nThe other wolves parted to make a path for it to approach. It was obviously all for show, a way for the wolves to display how the one nearing them was the big cheese.\n\nHan Sen looked at the purple wolf and saw the subdued gleam of purple lightning flickering in its eyes.\n\nHan Sen felt a renewed pressure, watching this wolf come closer.\n\nEveryone sweated in anticipation. If they had to fight again, they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have the morale to go on.\n\nThey wished to run, but their legs wouldn\u2019t follow their commands. That being said, they believed it was for the best. Attempting to outrun what was most likely a super creature was folly.\n\nEveryone was petrified, and even Lin He was shivering with fear.\n\nThe wolf was as strong as the spirit that had destroyed their shelter, and it sent a number of flashbacks coursing through Lin He\u2019s mind, those of the atrocities that had led them to where they were standing now.\n\n\u201cOh, no. The real king is this powerful?\u201d Lin He sighed in his heart.\n\nThe wolf walked up to Han Sen and stopped right in front of him.\n\nThey both looked at each other, as if they were squaring-off right before a fight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a super creature. And that means I\u2019ll definitely have to become a super king spirit if I\u2019m to stand a chance.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want to use it because it\u2019d render him weak, but there was little else he could do.\n\nThis forest composed only one area of Ghost Mountain, and no one could promise they\u2019d not encounter another, further along their journey. As such, Han Sen really didn\u2019t want to use it.\n\nBut he was accompanying Lin Weiwei, and Lin He had proven himself to be a good man. He\u2019d feel awful if he left them behind.\n\n\u201cDaddy. Kitty.\u201d Bao\u2019er was behind Han Sen, pointing at the wolf while speaking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a kitty; it\u2019s a wolf.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s smile was wry, but he did think it was amusing how she thought every furry creature was a cat.\n\n\u201cBut Bao\u2019er wants kitty.\u201d Bao\u2019er never listened, and she was determined to own everything she deemed cute.\n\nThe wolf king\u2019s hair stood on its end, and purple lightning flared up to coat its fur. It seemed upset, learning the baby believed it to be a cat.\n\nThe group of travelers knew they were weaker, but they still valiantly held up their weapons for the fight that was about to ensue.\n\nHan Sen looked at the wolf king\u2019s changing temper and prepared himself to cast his super king spirit mode.\n\nThe purple lightning grew brighter across the wolf\u2019s body, and it looked powerful enough to destroy an entire planet.\n\nThe wolf seemed as if it was going to attack, and the lightning bubbled and boiled like the magma residing in a soon-to-erupt volcano. It made everyone take a step back.\n\nHowl!\n\nJust as Han Sen was preparing to cast his super king spirit mode, something howled in the distance.\n\nIt was as if all the wolves stopped breathing. And to the humans, the long howl stood out from all others they had been hearing so far.\n\nIt was similar to the howl of a wolf, but it was slightly different.\n\n( )\n\nStrangely, when the howling came to an end, the wolf king looked less aggressive. Its blinding light subsided, and then it turned around and left.\n\nAll the wolves turned away from them and left. They disappeared into the darkness, vanishing as if nothing had happened."
