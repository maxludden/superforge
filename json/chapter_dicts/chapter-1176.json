This image he had of them became extremely distorted when he witnessed them enter the Sky Fruit: their grace was discarded in favor of being simple, hard-working miners.\n\nThe Sky Fruit nuts were not too tough, but the shells around them were like spherical bulwarks. To retrieve the nuts, the shells had to be broken. But there were also barriers to break.\n\nThe barriers were a little harder than the physical shells of the nuts. He had tried to break a shell with his Phoenix Sword previously, but he had been unable to. Without such weaponry, and with the barrier being stronger, he was in for a trying time.\n\nHan Sen accepted a shovel, given to him by Dry Bone King. Upon striking the barrier before him, he was only able to peel away a thin section. Digging through it all was sure to take a long time.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t just one barrier there, either. The entire fruit was composed of various nut rooms, with entries separated by additional barriers of their own. Han Sen\u2019s job was to break through the barriers to obtain the geno treasure that was said to reside inside. The lower tier creatures would then come and take the nuts.\n\nSeeing them all working hard, Han Sen\u2019s mind drifted back to wonder who might have placed the slip of paper in his room. And why the note said what it did, telling him to follow Qing Jun King.\n\n\u201cWeird.\u201d Han Sen suddenly heard Dragon King\u2019s voice, as if he had spoken directly into his ears. Han Sen looked around, seeing if anyone else might have heard him. It didn\u2019t seem that way, so he peeked at his ring.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; this is a secret method of communication. They won\u2019t hear me,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen wanted to talk, but he didn\u2019t know how to do so without alerting the others. He\u2019d look like a madman, babbling to himself.\n\n\u201cThis Sky Fruit is weird.\u201d Dragon King paused, and then went on to say, \u201cI can\u2019t feel the presence of geno treasure.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cThe tree is dead. Isn\u2019t the lack of a geno treasure normal?\u201d\n\nIt looked as if Dragon King could read Han Sen\u2019s mind, as he then said, \u201cI can sense the presence of geno treasures, even if they haven\u2019t been created yet. I know where they would be. Here, there is absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cForget about the treasure; just find out where the tree we\u2019re looking for might be.\u201d Han Sen used dongxuan aura to hide himself and his speech.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sense that, either,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen wanted him to find out where the Sky Tree was. Now, unable to find a trace of it, Han Sen was starting to suspect Dragon King was seeking to double-cross him.\n\nHan Sen and Dry Bone King\u2019s people continued digging for another hour, and that was when they uncovered a path that led to the nut.\n\n\u201cThis place serves as a junction that leads to four nut rooms. We should split into four teams to cover each path. Whoever finds the geno treasure first can claim it; if you can\u2019t claim it, others can try,\u201d Qing Jun King said.\n\n\u201cDry Bone, Baby Ghost, group up with Earth Beast,\u201d Qing Jun King said.\n\nEleven people split into four teams. Qing Jun King did not put Han Sen in a team. One other super creature was left out, too, and so she said, \u201cYou\u2019re new, so who would you like to team up with? Me or the creature?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThis choice surprised Dry Bone King and Baby Ghost King. Qing Jun King was shocked, too. Qing Jun King\u2019s face went cold again, and she walked towards the barrier. Dry Bone King wished to say something, but everyone would have heard him speak. Regretfully, he had to hold his tongue.\n\nHan Sen saw that he wished to say something, and guessed his words would have been something like, \u201cYou\u2019re committing suicide.\u201d\n\nBut Han Sen did not choose Qing Jun King because of the paper. He wasn\u2019t afraid of her, and he could use this opportunity to find out why she so desperately wanted Qiu Ping to kill Zhang Yuchen.\n\nShe could have killed them both with the greatest of ease, so her need for drama seemed unnecessary and uncharacteristic of a king spirit.\n\nThey broke the nut and then started to work on another barrier. Han Sen was only able to dig up a thin slice each time, but Qing Jun King was able to dig up a whole lot more. It took them two hours to dig a path that was big enough. After going through, they arrived in another nut room. They had to dig a path that was big enough for the creatures to come through and carry the fruit out.\n\nFor now, though, they were alone together. Han Sen knew he had to be careful, but Qing Jun King seemed focused on the task at hand. She got to work on yet another barrier.\n\nHan Sen followed, but kept his wits about him.\n\n\u201cThis is strange. Real strange.\u201d Dragon King\u2019s voice started to sound in Han Sen\u2019s ear again.\n\nQing Jun King was standing one meter away from Han Sen, so no matter how quietly he sought to speak, she\u2019d hear any response he made to Dragon King.\n\n\u201cI can feel the presence of geno treasure ahead. It is behind this wall, but it\u2019s strange,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen was happy, hearing he was about to stumble across the treasure. But with Qing Jun King there, they\u2019d probably fight over its ownership.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cThere is something very wrong with this geno treasure.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wanted to ask him for more details, but couldn\u2019t on account of Qing Jun King being right next to him.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I know where the Sky Tree is!\u201d Dragon King suddenly screamed."
