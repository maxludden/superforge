He felt incredibly light, as if he could shoot off into the skies at any given moment.\n\nAs Han Sen continued his observation of the birds, he suddenly heard a rumble. He turned around and saw a wall on the left side of the hall rise up. Inside, there was a room.\n\nA three-meter-tall spirit was standing inside, and just a mere glance was all it took to recognize how monstrously powerful he was.\n\nHe possessed three eyes, all of which gleamed silver like the spirit\u2019s hair. They looked alive and dripped with excitement.\n\n\u201cA hundred-thousand-years. I, Xie Qing, am free once more!\u201d He wasted no time, calling out at the top of his lungs. He was oozing a fever-like excitement.\n\nHan Sen watched the spirit with great surprise.\n\nWhen he arrived there, his Dongxuan Aura had been unavailable. As such, he had been unable to detect the presence of the spirit.\n\nIf the spirit had been trapped there for such a long period of time, there must have been something special about him.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t afraid, though. And he wouldn\u2019t be, even if the spirit was a king spirit. He could always use his super king spirit mode, after all.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking at? Get over here and bow before me!\u201d The spirit, who proclaimed himself to be Xie Qing, commanded.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Han Sen asked, in shock.\n\nHe had mistaken Han Sen, a human, for a spirit. That was quite the error of judgment, not something likely to be done by a king spirit.\n\nHan Sen believed, if he had indeed been trapped down there for a hundred-thousand-years, the spirit would still believe humans to be primitive wildlings. Perhaps such a mistake was warranted, and maybe he didn\u2019t even know anything about humanity occupying the shelters at all yet.\n\n\u201cAre you a creature?\u201d Xie Qing frowned. Perhaps he had been trapped in there too long.\n\n\u201cNo; I\u2019m a spirit. I\u2019m just special.\u201d Han Sen held his fist as he talked, and he continued, \u201cI am San Mu, my king.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are just a royal spirit, aren\u2019t you? What is so special about you, exactly?\u201d Xie Qing eyed Han Sen with suspicion. Still, there was a glimmer of a certain satisfaction, having heard Han Sen refer to him as a king.\n\n\u201cDid you open my cell and free me?\u201d Xie Qing King asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI was simply walking around here, admiring the place. The wall opened up of its own volition,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\nXie Qing King looked at the room and said, \u201cThat cheap turkey! He used me to clear the invaders of this place. He played me like a d*mn fiddle, and I waltzed right into his trap!\u201d Xie Qing King said, as he looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou said your name is San Mu? Follow me! When I claim the treasure, left behind by that turkey, I\u2019ll give you a small portion as a reward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Han Sen bowed.\n\nHan Sen preferred peace. There was no need for him to create any more enemies if he could avoid it.\n\nPlus, the king spirit had not shown an ounce of hostility. Therefore, there didn\u2019t seem to be any particular need to kill him.\n\n\u201cIs that a baby?\u201d Xie Qing King asked, as he looked at Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cYes, it is my daughter. Her name is Bao\u2019er,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nXie Qing King responded, \u201cYou are so weak. Why would you even waste time having a baby?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought it obnoxious. Powerful people always felt like only they should have babies.\n\nXie Qing King observed the hall as they went, seemingly lost in thought.\n\nXie Qing King walked across the hall to its other side and said, \u201cThis way. It\u2019s high-time we checked out the turkey\u2019s treasury.\u201d\n\nHan Sen guessed the turkey he was referring to was Phoenix Emperor. Believing that the spirit indeed knew the way there, he saw no problem following him.\n\nBut in the next second, Xie Qing King\u2019s fist blazed with a silver light. Then, he broke a wall that had been decorated with a number of avian symbols.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu-Alu!\u201d Xie Qing King shouted, as he continued to punch the wall. He punched through a meter-thick wall of solid stone.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, at what the spirit had just suddenly managed to do.\n\nEarlier, he had tested it himself with his new Phoenix Sword. With a strike, he could only plunge it a single inch into the wall.\n\nFurthermore, Han Sen had been afraid of traps, so he had spent most of his time in the shelter with much care. This spirit seemed to be a little on the reckless side.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing over there? Come here and stay close.\u201d Xie Qing King frowned, and then he went on to mumble, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I brought a dumb*ss with me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not pay much heed to the insult he had been given, and he just followed as the spirit wanted him to.\n\nAfter exiting the hall, they came to a branching corridor.\n\nHan Sen wondered which way the spirit might decide to go, but again, he just started to chant \u201cAlu-Alu.\u201d Then he smashed the wall ahead of them with his fist.\n\nIn this way, they went on for some time. Han Sen stayed close behind, as Xie Qing King broke down wall after wall. He imagined the spirit would eventually get tired of doing that, but he never seemed to. He just kept on going, wall after wall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Han Sen said to himself."
