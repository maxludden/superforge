    "text": "\u201cThe fate monument is not a treasure that can be broken with brute force.\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster wore a wry smile. \u201cRight now, I am waiting for my fate to be on the fate monument. If we use brute force to attack the fate monument, only our fate will be damaged. If we break the fate monument, our life will be broken there too. We will die.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this treasure that magical?\u201d Han Sen looked at the monument with shock.\n\n\u201cMister, he is correct,\u201d Nine Thousand King said. \u201cThe fate monument cannot be broken by brute force. If the Holy Kirin was still around, this monument could be broken. Now, the Holy Kirin is dead. The fate monument can do stuff by its own will, but maybe we can break it.\u201d\n\nWhen hearing Nine Thousand King sound like a slave before Han Sen, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and Sky Palace\u2019s first seat looked very strange.\n\n\u201cWhat way?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nNine Thousand King did not answer. He looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster, Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, and the others with hesitation. Obviously, he did not want them to hear the solution.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat looked at him with disdain and coldly said, \u201cYou are just a servant of Sacred. What kind of method or knowledge can you have? You only want to use the Call of Fate function of the monument, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King was not going to hide it. He fought back and replied, \u201cIf you know the monument has a Call of Fate, and you are still trapped here, isn\u2019t your life too cheap?\u201d\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat was not angered by this. He coldly looked at Nine Thousand King and said, \u201cMy life is a very heavy one. It is 9,818 kilograms heavy. I wonder how heavy your life is. We can see whose life is cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Nine Thousand King was furious. The eye on his armor opened. It looked like he was ready to fight.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat looked at Nine Thousand King coldly. He was casting a power too.\n\nHan Sen looked at Nine Thousand King and asked, \u201cNumber Nine, what is Call of Fate?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King looked at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat madly. He then bowed and said, \u201cMister, Call of Fate is the base power of the fate monument. It is like a normal creature using gold or stone to suppress an enemy. If the opponent is more powerful, the requirement of gold or stone would be greater. You had to be heavier than the opponent to suppress them under the gold and stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe logic of the fate monument is like that, but it suppresses a soul and not one\u2019s flesh. Ordinary powers cannot escape the fate monument\u2019s suppression, but souls have weight. We cannot see or touch it usually. We can\u2019t measure it either, but the fate monument can measure how heavy your soul is. It uses kilograms to do it. Without the Holy Kirin controlling it, the fate monument can suppress souls that are 10,000 kilograms heavy or below. If your soul is heavier than 10,000 kilograms, you can escape the suppression of the fate monument. You might even be able to control the fate monument and become its new master.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought this was funny. He laughed out loud as he asked, \u201cReally? What determines the weight of the soul? Your achievements? Your talents? Is it your level, maybe?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King shook his head. \u201cIt has nothing to do with your achievements, talents, or level. The weight of a soul, for every creature, is fixed. It is there when you are born. It does not increase nor decrease. Even some cheap low-life creatures can have a soul that is 10,000 kilograms. Many true god elite souls might be as light as a feather.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so what is the effect of the weight of a soul?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Nine Thousand King quickly said. \u201cThe soul does not affect your talent or your practice. It also does not affect your lifespan. It does not do anything about your leveling up either. Aside from affecting the fate monument, I have never heard of the soul\u2019s weight contributing to anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because you are ignorant.\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat behaved as if he had a grudge with Nine Thousand King. He looked at him with disdain.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s face looked angry. The green eye on the armor stared at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat as he said, \u201cSo, are you not ignorant? Then, what is the use of a soul\u2019s weight?\u201d\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat said, \u201cThe weight of a soul is the base of life. If it is light, your life is cheap. If it is heavy, your life is expensive. It measures your fate. How is that useless?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King looked disdained. He coldly said, \u201cYou are exaggerating. According to what you\u2019re saying, the barons and viscounts that have a 10,000-kilogram soul are more important than true god creatures.\u201d\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat squinted his eyes. \u201cThe weight of life depends on your level. Commoners like you would never understand that.\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King was going to argue with Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, but Han Sen interrupted them. \u201cHow do you begin the Call of Fate? Is it dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only need to place a drop of your blood onto the fate monument, and it will weigh your soul,\u201d Nine Thousand King quickly said.\n\nHan Sen looked at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, but he said nothing. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not say anything either. He supposed Nine Thousand King was likely correct.\n\nHan Sen did not try it himself. He received a drop of blood from the goldfish\u2019s wound and threw it at the fate monument.\n\nThat drop of blood was like lava when it hit the fate monument. It spread like paint in water. The entire monument turned red.\n\nHan Sen suddenly saw the top of the fate monument spawn four number zeroes. They started to jump, starting from 0001.\n\nHan Sen knew that each number meant one kilogram. Four digits meant the maximum was 9,999. If it hit 10,000, which was more than four digits, that meant it reached the maximum of the fate monument. The fate monument would not be able to suppress the soul.\n\nHan Sen looked at the fate monument number keep jumping and thought, \u201cThis fate monument works just like the law\u2019s eye.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought the number on the fate monument would keep rising. After all, the life of a true god xenogeneic could not be too light.\n\nThe number on the fate monument only reached 26 before stopping. It did not move anymore.\n\n\u201cIs the big goldfish\u2019s soul only worth 26 kilograms?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. That was unexpected.\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat said his soul weighed 9,000 kilograms. The big goldfish was true god too, but it only had 26 kilograms. The difference was far too staggering."
