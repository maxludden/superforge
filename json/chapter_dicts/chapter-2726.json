    "text": "Shale\u2019s punch struck the Six-Eared Macaque solidly and sent the creature\u2019s body soaring through the sky.\n\n\u201cHe hit the real body?\u201d Han Sen instantly refocused on the fight. The Six-Eared Macaque had managed to escape using its fake body this time. Shale\u2019s blow had landed on the real monkey.\n\nShale chased after the flying monkey like he was part of its shadow. His punches were like a river, bursting its banks to flood over the Six-Eared Macaque. The creature\u2019s body started to crack, and deified blood poured everywhere.\n\nNo matter how many movement skills it used or fake bodies it summoned, the creature continued to lose ground. It no longer had the power to battle Shale\u2019s mighty fists.\n\nUnder the continuous stream of hits, the powerful Six-Eared Macaque was badly injured. It squealed as many fissures and wounds appeared across its body. But the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body was so strong, and as of yet, Shale hadn\u2019t managed to inflict any serious injuries. Only its skin was being injured.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Shale suddenly stopped attacking. He wanted to give the Six-Eared Macaque a chance to retreat and compose itself. Shale watched it from afar, giving it a moment to breathe. He slowly waved his fists and shouted.\n\nAfter Shale\u2019s shout, the space around him shone with a striking power that looked like the sun. Countless gleams of that striking power flooded out of Shale. It was like a meteor shower ceaselessly raining down on the Six-Eared Macaque, and each gleam exploded on contact like a nuke.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe scary explosions almost destroyed everything. Under the never-ending attacks of that scary power, the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body was unable to hold up. The creature\u2019s godly body was slowly being torn apart.\n\nHan Sen watched the display in amazement. Shale\u2019s punch was rather similar to his own Under the Sky knife skills. The punch Shale had just cast was summoning power that had been previously dispersed.\n\nThe attack wasn\u2019t exactly like Under the Sky, however. It was only similar.\n\n\u201cThis is the Sea\u2019s Return to the Stream. It is very similar to your Under the Sky knife skills. Do you think Shale performs it well?\u201d Li Chun Qiu asked calmly.\n\n\u201cHe is very strong,\u201d Han Sen confessed honestly. In such a short amount of time, Shale had become very proficient with such a challenging geno art. It meant he was very strong.\n\nShale had lacked knowledge and geno arts in the past, but the Very High had been kind enough to fix those flaws. The more geno arts that Shale learned, the scarier he would become. It would be just like leveling up again.\n\n\u201cI hope you become deified soon. Don\u2019t make Shale wait too long,\u201d Li Chun Qiu said. Shale walked over to them, carrying the Six-Eared Macaque over his shoulder. He nodded to Han Sen and turned to leave with Li Chun Qiu.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t concern himself with the two of them. He happily held the Good Fortune Spell and sighed. \u201cIt would be great if the universe had more people like Li Chun Qiu in it. I have made too many enemies here, but for some reason, I don\u2019t need to find resources myself now. I will have an endless amount.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was preparing to leave when he suddenly felt something wrong. His heart told him he was in danger.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen teleported away just a shadow struck the spot he had been standing a moment before.\n\nHan Sen leaned forward to get a better look at the shadow, and what he saw gave him a shock. It was a monkey that was half the size of a human in height. Its head had six ears, with each one looking like a snail. Golden fur covered the being. It looked like the Six-Eared Macaque, but it was much smaller than the first Six-Eared Macaque.\n\nEarlier, Han Sen had watched Shale defeat the Six-Eared Macaque. The man had even dragged the creature\u2019s body away with him. And now, there was a smaller one right here. That was unexpected.\n\n\u201cWas that prior Six-Eared Macaque a mother monkey? Did it have a baby that Shale didn\u2019t see?\u201d Han Sen murmured to himself, looking at the smaller Six-Eared Macaque.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t think of any other explanations for why a miniature Six-Eared Macaque had appeared before him. But the xenogeneics inside the Star Fruit had no chance of getting pregnant. Therefore, his theory didn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cYou are a mother monkey. You all are mother monkeys. This is my real body. What they took away was just one of my fake bodies,\u201d the Six-Eared Macaque shouted shrilly at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAwesome. The fake body was able to trick Li Chun Qiu? It even tricked me. This Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s fake body skill makes it invincible,\u201d Han Sen thought in awe.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque looked murderous. It glared at Han Sen and said, \u201cEarlier, with that Very High monster nearby, I had to fake my own death. But now, there is no need for me to hide. After I kill you, I can go out into Outer Sky. Even if that Very High monster realizes that the body was a fake and comes back here to get me, he won\u2019t be able to find me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat idea isn\u2019t a bad one, but I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re wrong about one thing.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque asked, its eyes glittering at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scarier than that Very High monster. If you quietly left earlier while you had the chance, you could have gotten away free. It is a shame you wanted to murder me instead. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be the one who ends up dead today.\u201d Han Sen sounded serious.\n\n\u201cYou are just a half-deified. How dare you try to bluff me!\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque shouted furiously. It ran toward Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Apollo Set shone as he threw a punch toward the Six-Eared Macaque.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s punch caught the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body mid-leap and tore it in half. It was just a fake body, however. The Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s real form was gone.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque suddenly appeared behind Han Sen. It punched Han Sen in the back, sending him hurtling forward. It was a long time before he came to a stop. There was a dent in the back of the Apollo Set in the shape of a fist. The Apollo Set seemed to be on the verge of breaking.\n\n\u201cHow dare you act so cocky in front of me!\u201d the Six-Eared Macaque screamed. It jumped at Han Sen again.\n\n\u201cThis monkey is so strong. It can use fake bodies, and its ability to hide its presence is unsurpassed. It is so hard to avoid it.\u201d Han Sen eyed at the Six-Eared Macaque, but he didn\u2019t fall back. He threw a punch to meet the beast.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body was destroyed, but once again, it was only a fake body. Han Sen didn\u2019t know where the real body had gone.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart leaped, and he cast the Dongxuan Sutra. Everything in the universe became a cogwheel in his eyes. Although he couldn\u2019t see the body of the Six-Eared Macaque, he could see the cogwheels of the universe that were moving while the Six-Eared Macaque remained invisible.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque was so angry. Its eyes were shining with rage, and it flashed toward Han Sen with great speed. It stared into Han Sen\u2019s eyes, raised its claws, and tried to slash Han Sen\u2019s eyes out.\n\nSeeing that it was almost in front of him, Han Sen swung his fist. He sent his punch toward the invisible-albeit-real body of his foe.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque was shocked. It had no idea how Han Sen had discovered where its real body was. It was too close, and it had no time to dodge. It sent a punch of its own to counter Han Sen\u2019s fist.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque found itself wrapped up in a soft snowfall. The shadow of a snowlady covered its body."
