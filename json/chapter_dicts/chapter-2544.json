    "text": "Two days later, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were happy to report to Han Sen that they had not grown any older. Although their connection was still there, they no longer had to combine if they wanted to survive.\n\nHan Sen let out a long sigh. This was the best result he could have hoped for. If the problem hadn\u2019t been resolved when he completed their genes, he had no other ideas on how to fix the issue. In the meantime, he spent all his energy practicing Big Destroyed. As he attempted to practice Big Destroyed safely, he wasn\u2019t putting in enough power to fully cast Big Destroyed. But as time passed, and he practiced more and more, he was able to generate Big Destroyed\u2019s light. But the Big Destroyed light he created wasn\u2019t even enough to kill a Duke in its current state. That meant it couldn\u2019t be used to consume King class xenogeneic genes.\n\nProgress was progress, though, and his advancement thus far made Han Sen happy. If he could successfully activate Big Destroyed\u2019s godlight, that meant developing power and control with the technique was only a matter of time.\n\nHan Sen kept practicing Big Destroyed. As he got used to how Big Destroyed\u2019s godlight worked, he grew more and more powerful with it.\n\nHan Sen used King class xenogeneic genes to practice. A month later, his Big Destroyed godlight could digest King class xenogeneic genes. It turned them into a pile of dust that was smaller than a speck of powder.\n\nHe used Consume to eat the King class xenogeneic genes that he had ground up with Big Destroyed. When he tested the process, Han Sen noticed his digestive speed had increased. Within a day, he was able to absorb a dozen King class xenogeneic genes that had been ground up into a powder, earning a dozen King genes. \u201cHahaha! Big Destroyed is different. Right now, I still haven\u2019t mastered the technique, but if I can practice and take Big Destroyed to the max, I think I\u2019ll be able to absorb King class xenogeneic genes incredibly quickly. I might even be able to eat one hundred King class genes in a single day.\u201d Han Sen was delighted. Within a few days, his Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s area had broken through to another tier.\n\nElysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng wanted to go to the core area to hunt xenogeneics. When they told Han Sen where they were, he discovered that they were close to his Jadeskin spawn point. He had them wait there for him, and he entered the core area himself. He found Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, and after the rendezvous, they went out to hunt core xenogeneics.\n\nMost people never really worried about the future; they only worried about the present. Han Sen had lots of King class xenogeneic genes, but his Big Destroyed and Consume were getting stronger and stronger. If he was able to break down a hundred genes a day, eating a thousand King class xenogeneic genes would only take a week and a half.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were first-tier Kings, but their powers exceeded what the average first-tier King could do. They were practically the same as Han Sen had been at his first-tier. Their skills and area powers were very good, so killing King class xenogeneics was a trivial affair.\n\nBut their digestion speed was much slower than Han Sen\u2019s Consume. Even if Han Sen used Big Destroyed to break their xenogeneic genes down for them, they could only digest one per day. Han Sen wasn\u2019t in a rush, but Li Keer was. She had been there for a whole month, waiting on Dollar\u2019s return. Not even the flicker of his shadow showed up, though. It was like he never planned on coming back. Li Keer\u2019s teeth itched.\n\n\u201cThat *sshole.\u201d Li Keer sat in the front of her ship, gritting her teeth and looking up into the sky. If he showed up, she\u2019d probably have to fight off the urge to smack him.\n\n\u201cLittle Sister, this is bad. The Very High should be emotionless, but you are very emotional right now. This is bad for you.\u201d A very pretty woman appeared on her ship. She stood behind Li Keer and looked at her.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, why are you here?\u201d Li Keer turned around to find a green-clothed woman standing behind her. The woman was pretty, but she was emotionless. Her face was like ice.\n\n\u201cI hear you have selected your target. Let me see how your silkworm is,\u201d the woman said coldly.\n\n\u201cGood or bad, it doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d Li Keer lifted her lips.\n\nThe woman, seeing Li Keer\u2019s face, shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re displaying too many emotions. Your practice of the Very High talents isn\u2019t up to par. I\u2019m worried about you failing, or resorting to selecting a poor silkworm that can\u2019t do anything in service of the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood or bad, it is none of your business,\u201d Li Keer insisted.\n\nThird Sister didn\u2019t become angry. She acted as if she hadn\u2019t heard Li Keer at all, and emotionlessly said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you admit it or not; I am your Third Sister. I cannot let you walk along this path of constant failure.\u201d\n\nBefore she could reply, Third Sister continued, \u201cOkay. Now tell me, where is this person you\u2019ve chosen? Let me see if he is capable of serving the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t here right now,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\n\u201cWhy not call him over?\u201d Third Sister said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told him I am claiming him. I can\u2019t contact him. If you are so smart, why don\u2019t you go and find him for me?\u201d Li Keer snarled.\n\n\u201cYou are so slow. You still haven\u2019t claimed him? What have you been doing all this time?\u201d Third Sister frowned. She wasn\u2019t happy with Li Keer\u2019s progress.\n\nLi Keer blushed. She had spent so much effort trying to convince Han Sen, but it never worked out. She hadn\u2019t told him who she was, and thus, she couldn\u2019t claim him.\n\nThird Sister looked at Li Keer\u2019s face but did not say anything. Something in her eyes swirled, looking as if a spinning galaxy was residing with them.\u201cTell me who your target is.\u201d Third Sister\u2019s eyes looked very magical.\n\n\u201cIf you are so smart, why don\u2019t you guess who it is?\u201d Li Keer said in a sulky manner.\n\nAgain, Third Sister didn\u2019t become angry. She just reached her hand out and grabbed one of Li Keer\u2019s hairs. Then, she stared into that strand of hair with her shiny eyes.\n\nHer spinning galaxy-like eyes revealed the image of Li Keer. The image danced as if the woman was rewinding time, revealing what Li Keer had been doing. Everything she had done in the past few days played before the woman\u2019s eyes. Time quickly went back to when she parted ways with Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHe is your target, yes? Dollar. I have heard his name. Right. He came first in the Geno Being Scroll. He defeated Lone Bamboo,\u201d Third Sister said, her voice neutral. Then, she stopped looking. Her eyes returned to normal, and the strand of hair turned to dust in her hand.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, how could you read my past without my permission?\u201d Li Keer sounded annoyed.\n\n\u201cBehavior like this doesn\u2019t belong in the Very High.\u201d Third Sister shook her head, ignoring Li Keer\u2019s protest. The stars in her eyes were still spinning when she spoke to herself, saying, \u201cLet me help you take a look at what this Dollar is doing. I will see if he can be your silkworm.\u201d\n\nHer eyes spun and the lights in them flashed. A shadow that looked like Han Sen appeared."
