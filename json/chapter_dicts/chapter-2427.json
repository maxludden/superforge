    "text": "The figures had hands, legs, and heads, just like humans. Oddly, though, they didn\u2019t have faces.\n\nWhere there should have been noses, eyes, and mouths, there was empty space instead. They were blank and faceless men.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t weirded out by the sight. After all, he had seen many kinds of weird creatures before, so a few carvings of faceless people wasn\u2019t enough to shake him up.\n\nThe disturbing thing about the pictures was the scenes that they depicted.\n\nThe one-hundred-meter screen held six pictures. The first picture showed a broken city tower. In front of that tower stood a few men without faces. One of the faceless men was using a sword to attack the tower.\n\nThat picture showed the backs of the faceless men. Their faces weren\u2019t visible, but when he thought about it some more and took it all in as a whole, Han Sen\u2019s gut clenched and goosebumps flared up across his skin.\n\n\u201cOh, sh*t! These faceless people in the painting cannot be us, right?\u201d Han Sen stared at the first picture.\n\nHe could only see the back of the faceless man who was cutting down the tower, but the scene reminded him strongly of when Night Wind had been clearing rocks from around the city tower.\n\nThere were another two faceless men watching, and a fourth man was lying on the floor. That was obviously Han Sen, Miss Mirror, and the Duke they had brought with them.\n\nNo matter how Han Sen looked at it, the picture seemed to represent their attempt to enter through the stone door. The people inside the carving were faceless and their figures weren\u2019t terribly distinct, which was the only thing keeping Han Sen from fully confirming that his theory was correct.\n\nHan Sen and Miss Mirror looked at each other, then turned their attention to the second picture. The carving still featured four faceless figures with their backs turned. Not far from the figures, a sword was lodged in the ground.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think that this picture required much interpretation. It was clearly depicting the moment that they had discovered the gigantic, rusty sword that had been stabbed into the ground.\n\nBut the third picture, without a doubt, was them standing in front of the screen. Three faceless men were examining the drawing on the screen. Only one faceless man was lying on the ground, and it really did look just like them.\n\n\u201cHum! Who\u2019s playing this trick? Come on out!\u201d Night Wind shouted. His sword of darkness slashed repeatedly at the screen.\n\nObviously, unless the person who created the pictures on the screen was a prophet, there was no way those carvings could have been drawn before their arrival.\n\nThe only possibility was that someone had imbued that screen with some sort of power, and when they arrived there, it generated the scenes that were visible across the carving.\n\nNight Wind\u2019s dark substance chains struck the screen and shattered again, leaving no trace of their attack on the screen\u2019s surface. The screen was as hard as a deified treasure.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your energy. Let\u2019s look at the rest of the picture for now,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nNight Wind\u2019s attacks were useless. He lowered his hands and joined them in examining the carvings.\n\nHan Sen understood what Miss Mirror meant. The third picture represented their current situation in front of the screen, but there were another three pictures. If the carvings were already carved prior to their arrival, then those three pictures might predict what would happen next.\n\nIf the pictures failed to predict what was to happen or if their predictions weren\u2019t accurate, it would prove that someone had been playing a trick on them. That would mean that the screen held no prophetic power, and they didn\u2019t have to be afraid of its contents.\n\nHan Sen looked at the fourth picture. The fourth picture still featured four faceless men, but they were now facing a tree. And this time, they didn\u2019t all have their backs turned.\n\nA faceless man lay on the floor, and two of the others had their backs turned, but the last faceless man was showing his faceless face.\n\nOne of the faceless men with their backs turned clutched a sword. The sword was pierced through the faceless man that was facing the front of the picture. Blood ran down the blade.\n\n\u201cIs this predicting that we will kill each other?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nNight Wind looked at the fourth picture and frowned. Miss Mirror had no reaction, and she merely moved on to look at the fifth carving.\n\nThe fifth picture didn\u2019t contain four faceless men. There were only three. One of them was lying on the ground, and the other two were in the process of strangling each other. From the picture, it seemed as if the faceless man on top was succeeding in suffocating the man below.\n\n\u201cThat is rubbish!\u201d Night River grunted.\n\nThis was a prediction that they would kill each other. Night Wind really thought someone had to be doing playing tricks on them, attempting to give them a scare.\n\nAgain, Miss Mirror showed no reaction. She moved on to look at the final, sixth picture.\n\nThe sixth picture was even weirder. There were only two faceless men left. One of them was on the ground, and the other knelt with their hands folded as if in prayer.\n\nIn front of the praying man, there was a statue with one thousand hands and one thousand eyes. It looked just like the statue they had seen before upon the stone path.\n\n\u201cSomething must still be alive here. It\u2019s changing the pictures to mess with us,\u201d Night Wind growled, giving the pictures a look of disdain.\n\nHan Sen knew why Night Wind was having such a strong reaction. He wasn\u2019t trying to point out how ridiculous the pictures were; he was just trying to prove his loyalty.\n\nThose four faceless men had no faces, and they couldn\u2019t be identified by their body shapes, either. It was impossible to tell who was who.\n\nBut the faceless man who held a sword had clearly attacked the others, and the Duke they had brought with them was clearly the man lying on the ground in all the pictures.\n\nOnly one of the figures in the pictures used a sword. Night Wind also used a sword, and he was good at sword skills. The faceless man who held the sword had to be him, and that was why he was dying to prove his loyalty to Miss Mirror.\n\nIf what happened in the pictures came true, no matter who Night Wind attacked, things would go very badly for him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know that Han Sen was a fake Prince Sixteen. Killing Prince Sixteen or Miss Mirror, who was the King\u2019s right-hand and sister, would have consequences that he didn\u2019t even want to consider.\n\nDeified beings were very strong, but compared to the combined might of the Extreme King, a sole deified criminal was nothing.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the person doing this is a god or a ghost. If he cannot come out, then that means he is scared of us. Night Wind, let\u2019s keep going,\u201d Miss Mirror said smoothly. Her pretty face was still serene. She didn\u2019t seem to care about the contents of the carving one bit.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t very concerned about it, either. Just like Miss Mirror said, even if someone alive was actively altering the carvings, that person wasn\u2019t daring to attack them outright. Their unseen enemy had to be scared of something, and that made them feel a little safer."
