    "text": "\u201cI can\u2019t control it much longer. It\u2019s going to kill you. Run!\u201d the little girl said, the panic in her voice growing.\n\nHan Sen looked at the little girl holding that knife. Her hands continued to bleed profusely. As her blood continued to flow the blade, the sharp knife\u2019s presence faded a little. It wasn\u2019t gone, though. The knife\u2019s aura was still there, pressing out against the little girl\u2019s hand. It moaned gently. Han Sen knew that if the little girl stopped giving it blood, the knife would immediately go after him again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave then. Can you tell me how to exit this planet? And also, what is your name?\u201d Han Sen knew that if he stayed, he would only be causing the little girl more pain. He crouched down as he prepared to leap up into the sky.\n\nThe little girl shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You just need to get away from here, as far as you possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. What is your name, though?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cGu Wan\u2019er. You should leave now. Get as far away from here as you can, and don\u2019t come back until I am gone,\u201d the little girl said.\n\nHan Sen was ready to leave, but when he heard her name, his body went completely still. He looked at the little girl in shock, and he asked her, \u201cYour name is Gu Wan\u2019er? Do you know Lone Bamboo?\u201d\n\nHan Sen remembered that Lone Bamboo had once mentioned his little sister was called Wan\u2019er because Pray to God was taken away by God. It was an incident that the man was never able to let go.\n\nIf Han Sen remembered things correctly, Lone Bamboo\u2019s sister was around ten years old when she was taken away. It had been many years since then, so Gu Wan\u2019er should have been a grown-up. Finding her in a child\u2019s body was quite the surprise.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you know my big brother\u2026\u201d A sudden smile bloomed over Gu Wan\u2019er\u2019s face as she looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI know him. We are good friends. Why are you here? What is this place?\u201d Han Sen glanced at Wan\u2019er\u2019s sharp knife, then walked closer to her.\n\nHe could have simply left if they were strangers. Now that he knew this little girl was Lone Bamboo\u2019s sister, though, he couldn\u2019t just leave.\n\n\u201cThis is God\u2019s Farm. It is like a buffet for God\u2019s Knife. God brought me here to take care of the knife\u2026\u201d Gu Wan\u2019er explained. Then she quickly asked, \u201cIs my big brother okay?\u201d\n\nAlthough Gu Wan\u2019er\u2019s explanation had been brief, Han Sen understood. She had been taken by God and brought her there. God had then given her this sharp knife and put her in charge of feeding it.\n\nGod\u2019s Knife ate by feasting on the blood of creatures. This place was called God\u2019s Farm, but it was one of many. Many similar planets were in this system, and Gu Wan\u2019er had to follow a precise schedule. She took the blade to each planet at the right time, allowing God\u2019s Knife to feed on a variety of different types of blood.\n\nHan Sen could immediately see that there were gaps in what Gu Wan\u2019er was telling him. She was hiding something.\n\n\u201cAside from the blood of those xenogeneics, it also requires your blood, right?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking directly at Gu Wan\u2019er.\n\nGu Wan\u2019er hesitated and forced a smile. \u201cYes. I have to feed it some of my blood every day. But do not worry. I have an immortal body. When I sleep, my body recovers. That is fine with me. But about my brother, is he doing fine? If you leave this place, can you not tell him you saw me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Han Sen looked terrible.\n\nAlthough Gu Wan\u2019er spoke with little concern for herself, Han Sen knew that God had done something very cruel. God had brought Gu Wan\u2019er here and given her an immortal body so she could use her blood to feed the knife. There was nothing godly about this knife. It was more like a depraved vampire.\n\nGu Wan\u2019er had been made a slave who was forced to sacrifice her own blood. Every day, she needed to offer the demon her blood without rest. She couldn\u2019t even die.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by no? What happened to my brother? God promised me that if I helped him raise the knife, he would let my brother go on to live a good life\u2026\u201d Gu Wan\u2019er paled, and she spoke more rapidly.\n\nHer body was so small, and it was obvious that she didn\u2019t have much blood to give. She had been bleeding for too long, and her body couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t there, the world means nothing to him.\u201d Han Sen walked in front of Gu Wan\u2019er, and he reached his hand out to the sharp knife. \u201cGive me the knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. You should leave now. It will kill you\u2026\u201d Gu Wan\u2019er stepped back.\n\nHan Sen knew that Gu Wan\u2019er wasn\u2019t lying. When he first sensed the knife, he knew it was a ruthless weapon. That was why Han Sen had originally intended to leave. He didn\u2019t want to put himself at risk.\n\nBut now that he knew that Lone Bamboo\u2019s sister was right here, and she was being tortured, he couldn\u2019t just turn his back on her and leave her to her fate. He had to try and help, no matter the cost. He was hoping to take Gu Wan\u2019er away.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t kill me.\u201d Moving fast, Han Sen slapped Gu Wan\u2019er\u2019s hands away from the knife. He stole the blood-sucking knife and clutched it in his hands.\n\nGu Wan\u2019er\u2019s eyes widened when she saw that she was no longer holding the knife. She said, \u201cGive it back to me quickly! This is God\u2019s Knife. It is so scary, and it will kill you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored Gu Wan\u2019er. He continued holding the knife by its handle, and he observed the blade carefully. Without Gu Wan\u2019er\u2019s blood, the crimson color of the metal was starting to fade. The demon-like shadow rose again. It was like a beast that would merrily feast on anyone it could. It turned to look at Han Sen. The blade began to tremble in his hands.\n\nBoom!\n\nWhen the sharp knife realized that Han Sen was holding it, a flash of bloody light shone around it. Han Sen\u2019s power was insufficient to maintain a grip on the knife, and it flew out of his hands.\n\nThe demon shadow of the knife formed a body out of bloody flames. Its shape was roughly humanoid, but it seemed to be wreathed in fire. It rattled and shook as it held the sharp knife. The red, ghostly eyes peered at Han Sen as if it wanted nothing more than to dine on his blood.\n\nBzzt!\n\nThe bloody shadow moved. The sharp knife tore through space, carrying a bloody presence with it as it tried to attack Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill him!\u201d Gu Wan\u2019er shouted. She stepped in front of Han Sen, spreading her arms.\n\nBefore the sharp knife got close enough to touch her, Han Sen grabbed the little girl and spun her around him. He threw a punch toward the sharp knife and said, \u201cRemember; no matter when or where, girls should stay behind men and be protected. Don\u2019t try to get in the way of the man. You\u2019ll just get him hurt.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nWhile he was talking, the fist and the sharp knife struck each other. The bloody flame danced madly as the punching power was shattered. The resulting shockwave tore into the field around them, forming a giant crater.\n\nThe nearby sheep were affected, too. The explosion washed over them, reducing them to a bloody mist.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t fall back, but he felt something tear in his chest. He felt the urge to cough up a little blood, but he swallowed it back down.\n\nThe knife roared, sounding like some terrible beast issuing a challenge. The next second, all four of Han Sen\u2019s geno arts activated within his body. He combined with Spell, and he entered his xenogeneic battle body mode."
