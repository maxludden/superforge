    "text": "Han Sen stood in the garden, watching the many planets clustered in the sky. The evening sky was like the image seen inside a kaleidoscope. The xenogeneic space twisted the dimensions strangely, so that Han Sen could even see buildings on the surface of the closest planets.\n\nMany of the planets were of good size. If it wasn\u2019t for the xenogeneic space, the planets would have collided with each other and annihilated everything within range.\n\nBut under that xenogeneic space, the planets were fine. They had their own orbits, and they were quite organized.\n\nLooking up in any direction from Narrow Moon, you\u2019d see many planets clustered together. There were circular ones, but also broken ones. Some of them were close, some of there were far. Their numbers were countless. And that was why it was called Narrow Moon.\n\nThe planets around Narrow Moon were very mysterious. There were three planets, the names of which were Tianmin, Tianyue, and Tianji. Every year, when those three planets formed a triangular constellation, the center space would reveal a tunnel.\n\nAnd this was why Narrow Moon was so mysterious. Only Baron class beings could enter. If you were too powerful, the energy inside would crush you, and you would die.\n\nThe tunnel would allow ten entrants. There were ten open spots for beings to join, and one spot would be occupied and taken away after each entrant.\n\nYisha had allocated one spot for Han Sen to enter. Whether or not a benefit could be earned was entirely down to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you are my student I helped you become a Noble, and I grabbed you a spot to goto Narrow Moon. But from now on, if you want more help from me, you have to prove to me you are worth the investment Otherwise, despite the fact you will still be my student, further chances for special treatment will be void,\u201d Yisha said seriously.\n\n\u201cI will work hard.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\n\u201cNo, you need to work like your life depends on it\u201d Yisha frowned.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Han Sen shouted.\n\nNow that she was satisfied, she chucked Han Sen a knife. \u201cThe space tunnel is going to open soon. It is too late to teach you knife skills, but I can teach you this one. If you learn this, it should help. It is called Tusk.\u201d\n\nYisha held a knife, and still talking to Han Sen, she told him, \u201cWatch. I will only show you this once.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Yisha drew her knife. She drew it very quickly and brought it right up to Han Sen\u2019s face with blistering speed.\n\nAnd then, Yisha stopped the motion without hurting him.\n\nHan Sen, seeing her strike, knew that what he had seen was from the opening of Teeth Knife. Han Sen had seen it acted out by the knifemind entity. He had already learned it at the time with the knifemind. And while he had only learned the beginning, he was a master of what he knew.\n\nYisha explained Tusk to Han Sen and asked if he understood. If he didn\u2019t and he had a question, she would answer.\n\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not have anything to ask her. After he received the Teeth Knife knifemind, he understood it a whole lot more. All he needed was practice.\n\nYisha frowned and did not say anything. She left Han Sen to practice it.\n\nShe wondered why Han Sen did not ask any questions. And she thought he might have just been pretending that he understood the technique. If he was, that was not a very good student to have. Plus, she was the Queen. And she was a busy person. While she did take time to teach Han Sen, it\u2019d be stupid if he did not cherish what she took the time to teach him.\n\nBut Yisha did not think he was too bad, overall. If he didn\u2019t suffer a little, at least, he wouldn\u2019t cherish anything that came to him easily.\n\nSo, she knew there might be trouble when he went through the space tunnel. She didn\u2019t have much to say about the matter, and she was willing to accept the possibility he might fail.\n\nYisha thought failing was no big deal. If Han Sen worked hard, it would still be worth it.\n\nHan Sen went back to his garden and practiced Tusk. He was planning on using this for combat. Han Sen knew many skills, but in case she found out his true identity, it was best not to use it.\n\nOnly Barons were going there, anyway. Han Sen figured he\u2019d be going with a bunch of snot-nosed kids of the Rebate. If they stirred up something, one skill would be enough to lay waste to them.\n\nA few days passed quickly. Yisha did not take Han Sen to the space tunnel, and he allowed a Rebate to guide him there.\n\nNarrow Moon had eleven stars. Aside from one of those stars, all of them were Kings. Knife Queen Yisha was a half-deified King, and there was only one other on par with her. That was Moon-Wheel King.\n\nThe Rebate had possessed many deified elites at one point, but that was long ago. There were none amongst them right now.\n\nMost of the higher races were like the Rebate, and tended to only have one deified elite. They were the ones who would light the lantern on the race\u2019s behalf. But even they would not live forever, and they too would die someday.\n\nBut without deified elites, the lesser races were still unable to usurp a lantern and claim it for themselves. Typically, they\u2019d need deified elites of their own to manage such a feat.\n\nIt was very hard for the higher races to create a deified elite. So, even across the space of a thousand years, witnessing a fight like the one with Kong Fei was extremely rare.\n\nOut of the ten Kings of the Rebate, Knife Queen was widely regarded as the cream of the crop. Aside from Moon-Wheel King, who was near-enough the same level, the others were far inferior.\n\nYisha kept practicing, hoping she\u2019d become deified. So, she did not care too much for the business of the tribe as a whole.\n\nOnly Barons could enter this competition. And so, the higher tier people wouldn\u2019t care too much about it, either. Han Sen did not know about Narrow Moon, and so it was a guard who had to lead him there. The other nine went there without an escort.\n\nWhen Han Sen arrived, the other nine were already there. They looked surprised that Han Sen had a guard to guide him.\n\nHan Sen looked at the nine of them, and he was surprised to see they weren\u2019t all Rebate. Amongst the nine, three of them were of a different race. It seemed the Rebate had alliances with other races.\n\nNo one made an effort to speak with Han Sen, but he didn\u2019t mind that at all. He felt far freer, that way.\n\nNot long after, the three planets positioned themselves like a triangle. In the center between them, a vortex manifested. It looked like a black hole."
