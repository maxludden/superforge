It still wasn\u2019t willing to come anywhere close to Li Keer.\n\nIf Li Keer was willing to lead, Han Sen had no reason to reject her offer. If she could find deified xenogeneics, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t mind helping her slay the bronze tripod.\n\nHan Sen still wasn\u2019t fond of Li Keer\u2019s personality, so he didn\u2019t talk to her all that much. But Li Keer was smart and talkative, and Han Sen discovered that she even had a sense of humor. He found it difficult to rectify her personality with how she had acted when they first met.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know that her attitude had actually changed.\n\nWhen they first met, Li Keer had looked at Han Sen as if she was far superior to him. It was like a human talking to a cow. Humans normally wouldn\u2019t bother talking to cows, because there was no point in having a conversation with a being of such low intelligence. They would just teach the cow what to do, instead.\n\nBut ever since that bet, Li Keer had realized Han Sen wasn\u2019t just some lesser being. He was her equal, or perhaps he even stronger, in some ways. Li Keer could no longer think of Han Sen as some foolish creature.\n\nBut the blame couldn\u2019t be put on Li Keer for her initial assumptions. Across the entire universe, all beings with emotions made similar assumptions about others that were not of their species. Even humans did.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deified xenogeneic that I saw not too long ago. It is a wolf god. I don\u2019t really know much about it, but I have heard that he isn\u2019t very strong compared to most of the deified xenogeneics in the core area.\u201d Li Keer continued to fly forward as she gave Han Sen the low down on the deified xenogeneic.\n\nAs she spoke, Li Keer was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not lying; the wolf god really isn\u2019t that strong compared to most deified xenogeneics in the core area. It can be considered medium-low. But it does have a wolf god area. That area not only summons a wolf pack, but it also summons clones of the wolf god. A whole horde of wolf god clones will be summoned, and they aren\u2019t much weaker than the wolf god itself. Let\u2019s see how you deal with an opponent like this.\u201d\n\nLi Keer wasn\u2019t doing this to harm Han Sen, but to see how he handled himself in danger. When he did fall into trouble, she would swoop in and help. She would save him and impress him with her skill at the same time. Then, Han Sen would more willingly obey her. That way, she could take him on as her silkworm.\n\nFollowing Li Keer\u2019s lead, Han Sen flew down toward a planet. Li Keer pointed in the direction of a mountain and said, \u201cI saw the wolf god on that mountain. I\u2019m too weak to fight it, so I\u2019m certainly not going over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Wait here, then. If there is a deified xenogeneic, I will help you eliminate the core bronze tripod whether or not I manage to kill this deified,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI will await your good news,\u201d Li Keer said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen nodded and flew toward the mountain. The bronze furnace remained behind at Han Sen\u2019s request. It didn\u2019t head for the same mountain as him.\n\nLi Keer\u2019s eyes flickered. She was far away from the mountain, but she could see all the flowers and forests that littered the landscape.\n\nQuickly, Li Keer\u2019s senses detected the wolf god on that mountain. It was different from ordinary wolves. The wolf god lived alone, and its body wasn\u2019t very big. It was barely bigger than an ordinary wolf.\n\nThe wolf was colored grey with a single black line running across its coat, but its fur wasn\u2019t ordinary. It was made of some weird metal. The metallic fur was smooth, and it didn\u2019t affect the creature\u2019s mobility.\n\nAs Li Keer\u2019s watched, Han Sen quickly found the wolf god. The wolf god was very territorial, and Han Sen had only just stepped into the valley when the wolf god revealed itself. Its hair straightened up, and its green wolf eyes peered down on Han Sen.\n\nBuzz!\n\nThe wolf god crouched and leaped forward, but then it disappeared.\n\nThe wolf disappeared from Han Sen\u2019s vision before he even got a good look at it. His eyes couldn\u2019t match the speed of the wolf god.\n\nWithout hesitation, Han Sen used his super god spirit body. While Han Sen was invincible, the wolf god\u2019s gray body leaped at him.\n\nBut instead of landing on Han Sen, the wolf god\u2019s leap carried it past him. It turned around and looked at Han Sen without attacking again.\n\nHan Sen had only just opened the super god spirit body, but he noticed that his super god spirit power was already starting to fade. Although Wan\u2019er was asleep, her effect on the super god spirit body was still strong.\n\nLi Keer planned to watch the fight between the man and the wolf, and then save Han Sen during a critical moment. But right after the fight began, Han Sen ran away.\n\nAs Han Sen flew up away from the planet, she could see that he had committed his full strength to fleeing. He didn\u2019t hesitate or ponder what direction he was going. Li Keer was frozen as she watched him do that. She didn\u2019t know if she should swoop in to save Han Sen.\n\nAlthough this was the result she wanted, she hadn\u2019t expected it to happen like this. She was planning to use the fight with the wolf god to witness Dollar\u2019s real power. Now she was still empty-handed, and Han Sen was running away.\n\nLi Keer was very confused. Han Sen apparently had no way of defeating the wolf god, and the creature leaped into the air and tore into Han Sen\u2019s body with its teeth.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was torn to shreds, but it was just a Moon doppelganger. The real Han Sen appeared farther in space, and he was still running.\n\nHe only wanted to confirm that there was a deified xenogeneic on the planet. He didn\u2019t plan on summoning the Gold Armor General to defeat the wolf god in front of her.\n\nBut the wolf god was a very aggressive creature, and it kept chasing after Han Sen. Although it wasn\u2019t as strong as the Gold Armor General, Han Sen would still have a hard time fighting it. He kept using Moon copies of himself to avoid the wolf god.\n\nHan Sen noticed that the core area\u2019s deified xenogeneics had some flaws. They might be deified in some ways, but in other ways, they were much worse than proper deified xenogeneics.\n\nSuch as the Gold Armor General: while its defense and swordlights were deified in class, its speed was still wholly King class. It even fought like a King. The creature didn\u2019t have the control and talent that Han Sen would expect from a true deified.\n\nAnd while this wolf god\u2019s speed was deified, its judgment and skill weren\u2019t up to par. Its attacking skills fell short, about as talented as an average King. So, Han Sen could see that the wolf was far weaker than an ordinary deified.\n\n\u201cNo wonder the core area\u2019s deifieds are referred to as fake deifieds. They all have flaws. I can\u2019t see them as being truly on a deified level,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nThe epic battle Li Keer had hoped to watch quickly devolved into a hungry wolf chasing a fleeing human. Han Sen used his clones and movements to evade his foe. His movement skills were spectacular, and not even the wolf god could harm him. But that still wasn\u2019t what Li Keer wanted."
