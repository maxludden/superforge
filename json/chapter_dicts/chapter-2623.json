    "text": "\u201cWoman, what are you doing?\u201d The Liu Widow was leaning down to kiss him, so Han Sen used his hands to stop the descent of her lips.\n\n\u201cI want you\u2026 Don\u2019t you want the Liu family\u2019s treasure? If you can love me like I want you to, I will give you anything you want.\u201d Liu Widow was staring at him like a wolf in heat.\n\nNo, she was more like a horny vixen.\n\nHan Sen planted his hands on her waist and picked the Liu Widow up. He walked toward the yard and threw her down on a stone desk.\n\nHer arms and legs spread out across the desk, the Liu Widow closed her eyes. Her face was red and she panted swiftly as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be gentle with me just because I\u2019m a delicate woman.\u201d\n\nBut after impatiently waiting for it to happen, nothing actually did. When she opened her eyes again, Han Sen had vanished from the yard.\n\nAfter Han Sen left the Liu Widow\u2019s house, he power-walked down Black King City\u2019s streets. But he felt as if something was wrong. The women all across Black King City cast strange glances his way. Their eyes seemed bold and hungry whenever they glanced at him.\n\nEven the eyes of shy, young girls looked like they were on fire whenever they looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis is wrong. Something is very wrong\u2026 Is this what the Charming God Jian\u2019s power is all about?\u201d Han Sen decided to leave Black King City. After he left, he saw Yun Sushang riding her crane.\n\nYun Sushang\u2019s expression twisted strangely when she noticed Han Sen. It seemed as if she wanted to avoid him, but at the same time, she was wrestling with the desperate desire to stay and see him. \u201cSushang, can I ask you something?\u201d Han Sen walked toward her and bowed.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yun Sushang\u2019s eyes darted around as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHas the Charming God\u2019s Jian worked its magic on me? This is very important for me to know. Can you tell me how much I\u2019ve changed?\u201d Han Sen said with seriousness.\n\nYun Sushang was shocked. And then she blushed. After hesitating for a while, she nodded. She nibbled her lips as she said, \u201cIt seems very serious. You should ask someone else.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Yun Sushang hurriedly departed. Han Sen called her back, but she ignored him.\n\nHan Sen knew this was very bad. After he went to the little jade island, he had Bubble take on his form and remain there, pretending to be him. With Bubble covering his absence, he decided to teleport to his home in the Alliance.\n\n\u201cYanran, is there anything off about me?\u201d Han Sen asked. He was lying on the bed with Ji Yanran curled in his arms like a cat.\n\nJi Yanran\u2019s body felt soft as she held Han Sen. With a look of satisfaction, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem. You look very good. You look a lot more charming than you did before.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by charming?\u201d Han Sen asked quickly, his eyes flashing with worry.\n\nJi Yanran looked at him closely. She held his chin as she stared at Han Sen\u2019s face. After a while, she trailed a finger down his jaw and said, \u201cIt makes me want to sleep with you\n\nmore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026 So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening\u2026\u201d Han Sen sank back on the bed in frustration. Now he knew why Yun Sushang was avoiding him and why Exquisite no longer visited him. It wasn\u2019t because they thought he was a playboy; it was because they couldn\u2019t resist doing something that was utterly forbidden. It would be something that couldn\u2019t be described. That was why people were avoiding him.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of f*cking race weapon is this? It\u2019s like a mating pill.\u201d Han Sen wanted to cry.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t doing as bad as Ning Yue, but this was bad in an entirely different way. It was good to be popular with women, but Han Sen didn\u2019t want to be a tool for women to enjoy.\n\n\u201cHoney, how about we do it again since the sun hasn\u2019t yet risen?\u201d Ji Yanran suggested, an obsessive glint in her eyes. She kept drawing circles on Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I need to sort out this issue with the Charming God\u2019s Jian.\u201d When Han Sen was finally back on his little jade island, his legs still felt a little weak.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t figure out a way to fix this situation, so he went to Sky Palace and asked Sky Palace Leader for his assistance.\n\nSky Palace Leader seemed to know about Han Sen\u2019s problem. After Han Sen explained, Sky Palace Leader smiled at him and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a really good thing? It\u2019s a great skill for producing offspring. Your genes are so talented; you should definitely make a few more babies.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked bitter and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need help in that department. Plus, if men start to\u2026\u201d Han Sen trailed off.\n\nSky Palace Leader laughed out loud and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The Charming God\u2019s Jian only works on the opposite sex. If you were a woman, having the Charming God\u2019s Jian would only make you attractive to men.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader, is there no way to get rid of this side effect?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t in the mood to joke around.\n\nSky Palace Leader kept smiling as he said, \u201cIf you were an elite that could control the power of the Charming God\u2019s Jian, this wouldn\u2019t happen. The problem is that your power isn\u2019t sufficient to control the Charming God\u2019s Jian, and thus, you are powerless to resist its effects. That is why you\u2019re so plagued by women that you came moaning to me.\u201d\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Sky Palace Leader went on to say, \u201cAs for a solution to this problem? There is one. You need to find a true god elite to seal up the Charming God\u2019s Jian. Do that, and it will no longer affect you. However, once that is done, you will no longer be able to use the power of the Charming God\u2019s Jian.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I can find a true god elite to help me?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked. He didn\u2019t need the power of the Charming God\u2019s Jian.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult. I can help you if you take some time to think about it. But hiring a scary elite like that would probably be expensive.\u201d Sky Palace Leader looked troubled.\n\n\u201cI will cough up any sum I need to for this to be fixed.\u201d Han Sen gnashed his teeth. He didn\u2019t want to be a walking sex toy. He would pay whatever fee was required.\n\n\u201cHow about this? You spend three days teaching out of every month. And then, I will help you find a true god deified.\u201d Sky Palace Leader made it sound like a complicated process, judging from the way he spoke. \u201cNo problem,\u201d Han Sen agreed instantly. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to bargain right now. There was no other way he might be able to find a true god elite to help him. He had to rely on the leader.\n\n\u201cYou must consider this. If the Charming God\u2019s Jian is sealed, unless you become strong enough to break that seal, you will never again be able to use its power.\u201d Sky Palace Leader smiled warningly at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t need it to find women,\u201d Han Sen said, clearly not caring.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that simple. If you have the Charming God\u2019s Jian at your disposal, women are more likely to approve of you. Even if you wanted their money and their lives, at some point, they would give whatever you asked to you without a shadow of a doubt. You can use it in Black King City. You will get a lot out of it. If you seal it, that will no longer be anoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader, please find a true god elite to help me seal it.\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\nHan Sen wanted those treasures, but he wasn\u2019t willing to sell his body for them.\n\n\u201cFine. Give me the Charming God\u2019s Jian,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\n\u201cThis thing will come back to me by its own will,\u201d Han Sen said with a depressed look. \u201cWait until you find a true god elite. I will give it to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is already in front of you. What are you waiting for?\u201d Sky Palace Leader said in annoyance.\n\n\u201cYou are true god class?\u201d Han Sen looked at the man in shock. He remembered that Sky Palace Leader had been a King when he competed in the Geno Being Scroll a hundred years ago. In such a short period of time, he had already become a true god.\n\n\u201cYou do know exceptional geniuses can hide their talents, don\u2019t you? Sky like me are adept at doing that.\u201d Sky Palace Leader smiled."
