It was as if the man had teleported away. Han Sen knew how strong the man was, but he noticed the man did not seem to possess any special elements at all.\n\nEven if he could not fly, he could defy gravity with a jumping capability that was almost as good as having wings.\n\n\u201cWere Han Jinzhi and someone from the Qin family members of the thirteen he spoke of?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nAs Han Sen mulled the question, he detected movement. When he looked in the direction of the disturbance, he noticed the empress returning. As she always had been, she was firmly perched upon her throne.\n\nHan Sen now understood why the man had told him to leave, but unfortunately for Han Sen, he had not followed the advice. He wouldn\u2019t be able to leave without the empress spotting him.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Retribution! How dare you trick me!\u201d The empress was fuming with rage as her hands clutched the shattered remains of some gem. Closer inspection told Han Sen it was the fruit.\n\nShe saw Han Sen, and although she knew he had done nothing to contribute to her being tricked, she wasn\u2019t quite willing to let him get away. Her anger had to go somewhere, and Han Sen was as good a punching bag as any.\n\nThe throne flew directly above Han Sen with a speed that exceeded the capabilities of his phoenix techniques.\n\nAs countless snakes took aim at Han Sen, he couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cWhy is she taking it out on me?!\u201d\n\nHan Sen summoned Little Angel and Disloyal Knight, then he used his Ancient Devil Soldier. With Phoenix Sword and Taia equipped, he was ready to do battle.\n\nDisloyal Knight used blue lightning, and it drew a halo below every hostile creature in the vicinity. The light slowed the serpents down by a considerable amount, and it also weakened the power they possessed.\n\nHan Sen and Little Angel were buffed, too, and they were now able to paralyze enemies.\n\nUnfortunately for Han Sen, each individual snake possessed a power that was comparable to a berserk super creature. When Han Sen tried attacking one of the slithering serpents, he could not hew its body in two.\n\nStill, the serpents were unable to do anything to Han Sen, either.\n\nThe empress was even angrier now. She had wanted to vent her rage on whatever creature or being she could find, and now she had been stalemated and was unable to do a thing.\n\n\u201cHey, lady empress, what\u2019s your problem?! I\u2019m just a simple traveler, passing by this scenic lake. We don\u2019t have a grudge, do we? Why don\u2019t we stop before we get ahead of ourselves?\u201d Han Sen did not want to fight.\n\nFurthermore, she was a spirit and she could respawn. Han Sen hadn\u2019t the faintest clue where she came from, so even if he was to struggle and defeat her, it would achieve nothing but a greater hatred and a grudge he might have to deal with further down the line.\n\nAnd since Han Sen had just managed to obtain two Aqua Fruits, he was far keener on finding out what he could do with them.\n\nGod\u2019s Retribution knew the empress would eventually return to the lake with a bloodlust, which was why he left the area in such a hurry and made sure to tell Han Sen to make himself scarce, too.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mind had been preoccupied with the mound of questions that had taken root, that he didn\u2019t really concern himself with the warning he had been given by God\u2019s Retribution.\n\n\u201cYou humans are the worst! I am going to kill you, and then I am going to kill him.\u201d There was no quelling the fire the empress was breathing.\n\nAnd try as she might, the steam she wished to release was not going anywhere.\n\nShe thought there had to be a connection between Han Sen and God\u2019s Retribution. They were both human, after all. It was far too much of a coincidence for her to have been played, and for there to be another human in the area just moseying about.\n\nThat was why she wanted to make Han Sen her target. She believed he had to be in on the trick that had been played upon her. The throne was unable to capture Han Sen, though, and this just bolstered her resolve and belief Han Sen must have had a hand in the misdeed that had been performed upon her.\n\nNot many humans possessed such strength in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and so the empress thought that further confirmed a connection between the two.\n\nThe empress was looking severely annoyed by this point, and she actually stood up and left her throne.\n\nHer legs were so long and succulent to look at, she was like a most-stunning queen to behold. Her fatal eyes stared at Han Sen, and they were so intense, you\u2019d believe they could drill holes in whatever surface they looked at.\n\nHan Sen kept falling back in his evasions, in the hope he could develop enough space between the two of them to run off. Unfortunately, the throne could not be shaken, and its resolve to murder Han Sen reflected its owner\u2019s desire.\n\nThe empress\u2019 eyes then began to glow, and the volume of light grew brighter and brighter. They soon resembled a couple of light bulbs.\n\nIn those eyes, there was a copper statue. It was molded to the shape of Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen suddenly felt himself freeze. He was unable to move.\n\nWhen Han Sen looked down, his flesh and bones had become copper. And lastly, his skin.\n\nHan Sen was in shock. There was nothing he could do to prevent this from happening.\n\nNow, after seeing the shape inside the empress\u2019 eyes, he understood what had happened.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra had been unable to prevent this from happening, and all he could do now was watch himself turn into a copper statue.\n\n\u201cYou think I can be bullied so easily?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes flashed with a white light that shot out to encompass his entire body."
