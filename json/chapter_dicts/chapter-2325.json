    "text": "\u201cWhy are you so nervous? Didn\u2019t I tell you not to disturb me unless I called for you?\u201d Han Sen asked from the building.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, this is bad! Queen Bai Wei is here,\u201d Lilly quickly said.\n\nHan Sen seemed to have expected this, so he pushed the door open and exited.\n\nBai Wei looked glum as she above the sea. In King\u2019s Garden, she received word that Han Sen had been destroyed by Bai Yi\u2019s Return to Origin. She went home and noticed that Bao\u2019er and the blood kirin were gone, so she immediately headed to Planet Water Zone.\n\nNot long after, the water shifted beneath her. Han Sen brought Lilly up to the surface with him.\n\nWhen Bai Wei saw Han Sen\u2019s face, her expression looked conflicted. She said icily, \u201cBrother Sixteen, you killed my guard! And you also stole things from Planet Wind Zone. Give me Bao\u2019er and the blood kirin back, or I will let my father decide how to handle these matters.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and looked at Bai Wei. He said, \u201cMy good little sister, I\u2019m afraid you have made a mistake. I am Prince Sixteen; why would I go to your planet and steal anything? I was only taking what rightfully belongs to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when was Planet Wind Zone yours?\u201d Bai Wei demanded furiously.\n\nHan Sen laughed. \u201cI have taken Han Sen. His body and his mind are now mine. So, I am him and he is me. His stuff is my stuff. So, of course I took back what belongs to me. What\u2019s wrong with doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t give me these quibbling rebuttals! Give me Bao\u2019er and the blood kirin back, or I will go and complain to father!\u201d Bai Wei shouted.\n\n\u201cWhatever. I do not have time for you.\u201d Han Sen turned to head back into the underwater city.\n\n\u201cStop! You can keep the blood kirin, but that kid is pointless for you. Give her to me, and I\u2019ll consider us settled.\u201d Bai Wei gritted her teeth.\n\n\u201cHaha! Such a beautiful little girl. Why would I give her to someone else? Of course, I will want to raise her all by myself.\u201d Han Sen grinned.\n\n\u201cYou *sshole!\u201d Bai Wei roared. She threw a punch at Han Sen.\n\nShe knew what Bai Yi was like. Han Sen was taken and nothing could be done about it, but she couldn\u2019t let Bao\u2019er fall into the lap of someone as sick as Bai Yi. That was why she wanted her back.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s expression was hard. He used his water area-of-effect to bind Bai Wei\u2019s body. It kept her from moving, and he easily punched her away.\n\n\u201cBai Wei, this isn\u2019t a place for you to take a sh*t. Stop being ridiculous! If you don\u2019t, I will be rude to you,\u201d Han Sen said threateningly as she was flying away.\n\nBai Wei slowed to a stop and hung in the air, wiping away the blood. \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to give me the girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want the girl that badly? Did you make it with Han Sen? I don\u2019t see memories of such a thing in Han Sen\u2019s head.\u201d Han Sen leered at Bai Wei.\n\n\u201cShe is just a little girl! She is useless to you. What do I have to do to get you to give her to me?\u201d Bai Wei asked stiffly.\n\n\u201cSuch beautiful and cute girls are very important to me. Okay, you are my little sister; if you want her that badly, then I will give her to you. But first, hand me your Thousand Heart Lock and I will give you back the cute little girl.\u201d Han Sen grinned.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d Bai Wei\u2019s face changed.\n\nBai Wei didn\u2019t have many good things, so she didn\u2019t have many decent geno treasures. But King Bai had given her mother the Thousand Heart Lock. It was passed on to Bai Wei later. It was her only deified item, and it was the only thing she had to keep her alive. This wasn\u2019t a secret among the Extreme King, and even Han Sen knew about it.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t give away Bao\u2019er, and so he suggested something he knew that she couldn\u2019t trade.\n\n\u201cI will swap a King class item for the girl instead. She is just a kid, you don\u2019t need her!\u201d Bai Wei looked sad.\n\n\u201cI said I want the Thousand Heart Lock. If you want my cute daughter, bring me the Thousand Heart Lock. If you won\u2019t, we are done discussing these matters. I\u2019ll leave you to think about it.\u201d After Han Sen spoke, he began to lower himself back into the sea.\n\n\u201cThousand Heart Lock is combined with my body. I cannot simply give it to you. Even if I could, you wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. Aside from me, no one can use the Thousand Heart Lock.\u201d Bai Wei stopped Han Sen and gritted her teeth. \u201cGive me the kid, and all of Planet Wind Zone\u2019s resources are yours for a year.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Planet Wind Zone was poor, but one year\u2019s worth of resources was an incredible thing for her to offer. She was planning to give everything for Bao\u2019er. He didn\u2019t know if she had been able to tell how special Bao\u2019er was, or if there was an ulterior motive to her desperation.\n\nIf she was willing to do this to prevent Bao\u2019er ending up with Bai Yi, then it proved her to be a very good-hearted person.\n\n\u201cYou are willing to trade so many resources for one little kid? That kid is special. I should really take good care of her. Perhaps she can earn me a lot more money. Maybe we can talk more about the price later. Hahaha\u2026\u201d Han Sen dropped back into the sea.\n\n\u201cA**hole!\u201d Bai Wei angrily punched the sea, but it a futile gesture.\n\n\u201cThat prick!\u201d the princess of the Siren growled at the same time. She was angry at what Bai Yi had done as well.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t need the protection of the Extreme King and her title as princess, she would never have married a scumbag like that. Even just her title made her feel sick. She really wanted to kill him.\n\n\u201cMy Princess, we need to look at the greater good. Prince Sixteen is the last generation of the virgin blood. We need him to take the holy item,\u201d the old Siren said.\n\n\u201cIt is only because my blood isn\u2019t pure enough that I cannot activate the relic. If it was, I wouldn\u2019t have to work with an *sshole like this,\u201d the princess said furiously.\n\nThe old Siren sighed. \u201cWe cannot change this. The Siren were destroyed, and not many of us survived. We need to mate with other races. You and Prince Sixteen have the blood of virgins. It isn\u2019t pure, though, so you cannot do it alone. It might work if you two cooperate. For the sake of the Siren, please endure.\u201d\n\nThe princess didn\u2019t say anything in response. She looked towards the garden, then walked in that direction.\n\nHan Sen went to the garden, but before he reached his little place, he saw the princess headed his way.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you so lonely that you require my company?\u201d Han Sen grinned. He was just pretending to be Bai Yi.\n\n\u201cGive me the little girl,\u201d the princess said emotionlessly."
