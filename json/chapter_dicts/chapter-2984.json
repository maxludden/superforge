    "text": "In the god palaces, the god temple under the geno hall began to release a 3,000-foot-long light. It was like a sun exploding.\n\nPreviously, the lifeforce was like a sea. The god temple that released the scary god light was suddenly dead. The shining gold god temple was dim. It was like some dust had been scattered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Han Sen and Bai King were shocked.\n\nThat god temple was very high. It was only one step below the geno hall. It was an Annihilation class god temple. Looking at the god temple now, it seemed as if it had been beaten and shut down.\n\n\u201cIn the universe, who can beat an Annihilation class God Spirit and force it to shut down?\u201d While Han Sen pondered this, he saw the dusty god temple door open. A shadow emerged from beyond.\n\nThe creatures of the universe did not see whose body it was. All they saw was a flash and the body disappear. It looked like it left the god palace.\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Bai King\u2019s face changed.\n\nHan Sen looked at Bai King and asked, \u201cOh, no, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Annihilation class God Spirit possessed a body and descended,\u201d Bai King said. \u201cIt entered the universe. We should run!\u201d He wanted to run off immediately. Before his body moved, he saw a portion of space move nearby. A body appeared. It was the same body that emerged from the god palace.\n\nThe body was not very tall. It just about a foot taller than Han Sen, but the power it wielded was strong. He was wearing black armor. His shoulders had a black hammer that was the size of a barrel. His god eyes were coldly looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYou killed a god! You should be killed!\u201d The God Spirit did not say much. He only said a few words before starting to wave his big hammer around in the air.\n\nHan Sen understood that the Annihilation God Spirit had possessed a body to descend and kill him since he had killed a god.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. He used Galaxy Teleportation because he wanted to leave. He wanted to teleport a few systems away. Han Sen teleported away. While he was teleporting, he was inside a space tunnel. He heard some explosion sounds next to his ear. He then felt his body get hit. He was knocked out of the space tunnel.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes flashed. He still saw himself in space. That God Spirit\u2019s strong body was not very far away. He was holding that big, scary hammer.\n\nThe space around was cracking like glass. The space cracks were like a spiderweb. The power of the God Spirit\u2019s hammer was breaking the entire system. It created many broken layers in space. Even using Galaxy Teleportation was impossible now. It could no longer be used. Han Sen knew it was time to fight for his life. Killing a Disaster class God Spirit had been incredibly difficult. It forced him to use his Super God Spirit mode. Now, an Annihilation class God Spirit was using a body to descend. The power of that hammer far exceeded Han Sen\u2019s power. Han Sen\u2019s full power attack was unable to reach the magnitude of his new nemesis.\n\nHe tightly held onto the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. Han Sen pushed his own power to the maximum.\n\nBai King, who was nearby, frowned. He looked at the God Spirit and said, \u201cI do not think we offended you. Why have you descended to come and fight us?\u201d\n\nThe God Spirit was holding his big hammer as he coldly responded, \u201cKilling a God Spirit is a crime.\u201d\n\nAfter that, another hammer came from the sky. He and Han Sen were a galaxy apart, but that hammer\u2019s power was not coming to strike Han Sen. It was striking the space that was in front of him.\n\nAfter the hammer came down, the whole of space shook. Han Sen felt as if his body had been broken by space.\n\nBlergh!\n\nHan Sen coughed up some boiling blood. He tried his hardest to fight back, but his xenogeneic battle body could still not withstand that scary shaking power. Many of his organs were severely injured, and his god bones had many fractures. It was like they were going to break any second.\n\nBai King was attacked too. His body was shining with light. There was a shield of light covering his body that looked like a God Spirit. It blocked that scary shaking power.\n\nThe God Spirit hammered down. This time, the hammer\u2019s strike was greater than the last one. Han Sen was in too much shock. He was forced to gather up power and ready himself for another battle.\n\nBoom!\n\nBai King\u2019s body appeared in front of Han Sen. That weird light was following Bai King\u2019s movement. It created a defensive bulwark and blocked the God Spirit\u2019s heavy hammer attack.\n\n\u201cSpirit of God!\u201d Han Sen was shocked. When he looked closer, it was not really a God Spirit. The light of Bai King\u2019s body was like a god and a demon. It was like an ancient battle spirit. It had three heads and six arms. Six of the hands were wielding different weapons.\n\nThere was a sword, knife, shield, jian, ring, and mirror. There were four types of weapons, and they were releasing a weird and mysterious light. The one that blocked the God Spirit\u2019s hammer attack was the shield.\n\nHan Sen looked at the light. It looked just like a beast soul and God Spirit, but it was different. He was thinking of the xenogeneics that had no souls in the Nine-Defense Palace. He thought, \u201cAre these spirit weapons made from the xenogeneic spirits?\u201d\n\nBai King stared at the God Spirit and slowly said to Han Sen, \u201cYou leave now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you saving me?\u201d Han Sen did not understand why Bai King was risking a fight against this God Spirit to save him. In any way, his relationship with Bai King was not a positive one.\n\nIf Bai King had come to save him because he was a student, Han Sen believed that was hogwash. When Bai King\u2019s son died, he had not taken it that seriously. And he was just a student.\n\nBai King stared at the God Spirit as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk about that. I cannot last long. Hurry up and leave. Get as far away from here as you possibly can.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is leaving! You are all going to die today!\u201d The god\u2019s voice was like thunder. It was extremely loud. After those words were spoken, the God Spirit\u2019s big hammer was coming down. The hammer carried an incredibly scary breaking power. It was suddenly in front of Bai King.\n\nThe shaking of space was very scary. Now that the hammer was coming, it was so strong that even Han Sen, who was behind Bai King, felt as if he could not beat it.\n\nBai King stared at that scary god hammer. He did not fall back. His body was like a demon god\u2019s shadow that was silently roaring in the sky. He was holding the shield while running toward the god hammer.\n\nBoom!\n\nA scary shockwave suddenly destroyed the space around. Han Sen used all of his power to fight the shockwave, but his Dongxuan Armor was starting to reveal cracks.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Bai King\u2019s voice was heard again.\n\nHan Sen gnashed his teeth. He turned around and headed for the broken space that looked like a spiderweb.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201d the God Spirit coldly shouted. He was holding a big hammer. He waved it at Han Sen, but Bai King stopped him.\n\n\u201cIf there is someone I want to save, not even a god can get in the way.\u201d Bai King\u2019s voice was clear and cold.\n\nHan Sen felt there was some scary space-shaking force behind him. Han Sen used the borrow strength skill and the shockwave to propel his sprint through the broken space."
