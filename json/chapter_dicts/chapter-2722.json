    "text": "\u201cCan\u2019t do what? I\u2019m offering you a true god item that can foretell the future, but all you want is to read comics and win the lottery,\u201d Empty God muttered bitterly. \u201cThe item itself is its own benefit. You can predict what is going to happen in a certain place in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with me. If it doesn\u2019t let me get lots of delicious food and great-looking clothes, then it is useless to me.\u201d Bao\u2019er was no longer interested. She returned to playing on the Star Fruit, swinging her body around it. She no longer wanted to talk about it.\n\nThis conversation was making Empty God feel terrible. The mirror was the treasure he most cherished, but Bao\u2019er had made it sound like a piece of worthless junk. It annoyed him, and he couldn\u2019t accept it.\n\n\u201cKids really are the worst.\u201d Empty God was furious, but dealing with this child was probably still easier than dealing with Han Sen would be. So, he kept his rage in check. He wasn\u2019t going to leave just yet.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, don\u2019t go yet. I have only mentioned one part of the Star Gauge Mirror\u2019s power. There are actually many more things this can do,\u201d Empty God said. He did his best to remain patient.\n\n\u201cWhat powers does it have?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked with much reluctance. She really wasn\u2019t interested in continuing down this avenue of conversation.\n\nEmpty God quickly said, \u201cYou will know it when you see. You\u2019re going to like it, too.\u201d\n\nThe glance that Bao\u2019er cast toward Empty God was filled with boredom. She had only replied to him out of simple politeness.\n\nUpon seeing Bao\u2019er\u2019s expression, Empty God knew that he would really have to knock it out of the park this time. Otherwise, it would be difficult to deal with the naughty kid any longer.\n\nLifting the Star Gauge Mirror once again, Empty God started to look a bit more serious. He had been treating Bao\u2019er as a kid, not believing she was all that important.\n\nBut Bao\u2019er had reacted in ways that he hadn\u2019t expected. She had thrown him off his game, and that made him take this matter a little more gravely.\n\nHe brushed the back of the mirror with his fingers, which set the compass spinning again. Light appeared from the surface of the mirror and shone on Bao\u2019er. It turned Bao\u2019er\u2019s cowboy clothing into a shiny set of armor.\n\n\u201cWow! So powerful.\u201d When Bao\u2019er saw the armor she was now wearing, she couldn\u2019t help but squeal in delight.\n\nWhen Empty God saw Bao\u2019er\u2019s sudden happiness, he started to behave a bit more cockily again. He turned the Star Gauge Mirror in his hands and said, \u201cThis is the Star Gauge Mirror\u2019s Mirror Armor power. It can make your armor\u2019s defense deified.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er looked as if she really admired her new wardrobe, and Empty God was about to show off the mirror\u2019s Mirror Armor power some more. Before he could continue, Bao\u2019er walked over in front of Empty God. She stared at the Star Gauge Mirror and said, \u201cIt is so powerful. I can change my outfit in the blink of an eye? This is a good item for changing clothes. With this clothes-changing mirror, I won\u2019t have to wash my clothes or change them myself anymore. Using this mirror, I\u2019ll be able to change how I\u2019m dressed with ease. This is so good.\u201d\n\nEmpty God\u2019s expression darkened. The child before him was incomprehensible. The Star Gauge Mirror could show the future and gift its user with extreme defensive qualities, but she didn\u2019t seem to care about any of that. All she cared about was the fact that she could change clothes.\n\n\u201cStill, it was lucky I\u2019ve got her on the line,\u201d Empty God thought with a wry smile. He went on to say to her, \u201cYou like it? Just tell me that you want it, and I will give it to you. You can always use the armor\u2026 I mean, you can always use it to change clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I change my clothes into the dress of a beautiful princess? I love princess dresses, but daddy thinks they are annoying. He doesn\u2019t let Bao\u2019er wear them,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, her expression forlorn and downtrodden.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Empty God once more found himself at a loss for words. Luring this child was proving to be more difficult than tempting an old, evil behemoth that had lived for a billion years.\n\nThose ancient creatures would at least have some sense. Empty God could guess what they wanted and needed. But after all this time talking to little Bao\u2019er, he still couldn\u2019t figure out how her mind worked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t? Then that is a shame. If I can only let me change into one set of clothes, then there\u2019s no point. That would be pretty boring.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked very disappointed.\n\nEmpty God was on the verge of giving up. Tricking Han Sen suddenly seemed easier than dealing with this little girl any longer.\n\nEmpty God thought about it for a bit, then decided that he should just change targets. He had no idea why Han Sen was keeping Bao\u2019er as a companion, but there was no reason for him to waste his time with a naughty kid that had a mind that could not be understood.\n\nLifting the Star Gauge Mirror and shining it on Bao\u2019er once more, Empty God removed Bao\u2019er\u2019s armor and returned her cowboy clothing to her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Bao\u2019er shouted at Empty God, her eyes suddenly wide.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Empty God remained stock still.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s face turned from shock to pleased surprise. Then, she flew toward Empty God and said, \u201cThis is so awesome. How can this mirror be so good?\u201d\n\nWhile she was talking, Bao\u2019er jumped in front of the Star Gauge Mirror and stared into it happily.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by powerful?\u201d Empty God still didn\u2019t understand what Bao\u2019er was talking about. He hadn\u2019t triggered any of the Star Gauge Mirror\u2019s powers. It shouldn\u2019t have been doing anything right now.\n\nBut based on the shocked expression on Bao\u2019er\u2019s face, it really did look as if she had discovered something awesome.\n\n\u201cDo you not see it? This mirror is awesome. Here, look.\u201d While Bao\u2019er was talking, she had already put her hands on the Star Gauge Mirror.\n\nAfter Bao\u2019er\u2019s continual rejection of the second gem and now his precious Star Gauge Mirror, Empty God actually became excited when she appeared to show genuine interest in the item.\n\nHe let her pull the mirror out of his hand, curious about what she had discovered.\n\nBao\u2019er was holding the Star Gauge Mirror and examining it closely. She mumbled over and over, \u201cThis is awesome. This mirror is so awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is so awesome about it?\u201d Empty God put his head next to Bao\u2019er\u2019s to try to figure out what she was seeing. He could see the mirror, perfectly polished as always, but there was nothing special going on. He could detect no weird powers within the item. It was acting just like it had when it was lying around without any active powers. He really couldn\u2019t tell what Bao\u2019er found so enthralling.\n\n\u201cUncle, haven\u2019t you noticed? This mirror doesn\u2019t show my face,\u201d Bao\u2019er said while looking at the mirror.\n\nEmpty God wanted to laugh as much as he wanted to cry, and he said, \u201cOf course you cannot see yourself. This is not an average mirror. The mirror is incredibly powerful, and unless you have a power greater than that of the mirror, it will not show your reflection. Therefore, you cannot see a reflection in it as you currently are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is awesome. Dad told me only vampires don\u2019t have reflections. Now that I don\u2019t have a reflection, Daddy will be so shocked!\u201d Bao\u2019er exulted. She wrapped the Star Gauge Mirror in her arms, bowed to Empty God, and shouted, \u201cThank you, Uncle. You really are a very good man. You have given me such awesome treasures. I\u2019m buying you lunch.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bao\u2019er leaped off the tree, still holding the Star Gauge Mirror. She ran forward, shouting, \u201cDad! Dad! Look! I have a very awesome treasure. A good uncle gave it to me.\u201d"
