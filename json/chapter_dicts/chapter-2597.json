    "text": "Han Sen didn\u2019t have many ideas on how to resolve the matter. If two armies were fighting and Lone Bamboo was in danger, he would gladly join the fight. But right now, Lone Bamboo was incarcerated by the powers presiding over Sky Palace. Furthermore, they weren\u2019t at war with the Very High. Therefore, Han Sen had no way of helping.\n\n\u201cThis is a hard situation to deal with. The Very High didn\u2019t want Lone Bamboo to join them permanently. It was supposed to be a temporary thing. Plus, they would have given Lone Bamboo a lot of resources. Others would beg for the benefits he would have been given for free. I don\u2019t know why Lone Bamboo would so firmly decide against going,\u201d Thousand Feather Crane said with a sigh.\n\nHan Sen thought that he understood what Lone Bamboo was thinking, but he hadn\u2019t spoken to the man in person yet. Therefore, he didn\u2019t know if his guesses were accurate.\n\nThe next day, Han Sen went to ask the Tenth Elder, Yun Changkong, about being allowed to see Lone Bamboo.\n\nYun Changkong was Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang\u2019s father, and he was Thousand Feather Crane\u2019s teacher. He had a good relationship with Han Sen, and he didn\u2019t deny his request.\n\n\u201cMaybe you can convince Lone Bamboo that joining the Very High isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Yun Changkong said to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen agreed. Then, Yun Changkong asked people to take Han Sen to the prison.\n\nHan Sen thought Sky Palace was just putting on a show. But when he went to the prison, he learned things weren\u2019t as simple as he initially believed.\n\nTwelve Suppress Demon Locks were pierced through Lone Bamboo\u2019s body. They pinned him to a Suppress Demon Stone. He was covered in blood. Even his collar bones had been punctured. Han Sen was shocked.\n\n\u201cYou are here.\u201d Lone Bamboo\u2019s limbs were locked painfully against the Suppress Demon Stone, and while he was in bad shape, he was still able to smile.\n\nIt would have been impossible for anyone to look good under the circumstances, though. Those Twelve Suppress Demon Locks had twelve different powers. There was water, fire, thunder, lightning, and eight other powers that attacked his body continually. Even deified elites might not last very long under these conditions.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like it would kill him, but being tortured like this\u2014day and night\u2014was a fate that was worse than death. \u201cIs treating you this poorly really necessary?\u201d Han Sen demanded, growing a little angry as he looked at Lone Bamboo.\n\nLone Bamboo was a student of the leader of the Sky Palace. He had the blood of Sky Palace\u2019s people, and yet, he was treated in this manner. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of sympathy being shown for him, and so the sight would give anyone a nasty chill.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at them. This is all my own doing.\u201d Lone Bamboo chuckled bitterly.\n\nHan Sen brought out a bottle he had smuggled in. He gave Lone Bamboo a few sips of the beverage. After swallowing some himself, he asked, \u201cWhy do you refuse to join the Very High?\u201d\n\nLone Bamboo licked the wine on his lips and said, \u201cJoining the Very High would be very good for me. If I don\u2019t go, it might take me a decade or two to become deified. If I go to the Very High, I could become deified in only three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you understand that, then why don\u2019t you go?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Lone Bamboo. He knew that the man must have his reasons.\n\nLone Bamboo looked at Han Sen and didn\u2019t answer his question. He asked, \u201cYou like running naked?\u201d \u201cI, um\u2026 I guess I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t know what Lone Bamboo meant, and so his answer was uncertain.\n\nLone Bamboo smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, either. So, no matter how many benefits the Very High offer me or how much punishment I must endure, I\u2019m not going to the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you saying the Very High like to run naked? You must take off all your clothes while you\u2019re there?\u201d Han Sen imagined Exquisite and Li Keer frolicking naked. It was an image that made him smile.\n\nOf course, Han Sen was just joking. He knew the Very High wouldn\u2019t be that creepy.\n\n\u201cThe Very High\u2019s Very High Sense can sense anything in the world. If you are chosen by them, you become a medium for them to feel the world. They can feel everything you do. If you eat, they can taste the saltiness, sweetness, sourness, or spiciness of your food. When you shower, they will know if it is hot or cold. Your emotions, your hobbies, or even your feelings when you sleep with a woman; the Very High will get to experience everything. If you were in my position, would you go?\u201d Lone Bamboo asked, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 are the Very High that sick?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cThis is merely my perspective. Of course, they might not be interested in which woman you sleep with, but regardless, you have no way of shutting off their power to feel whatever you do. Once you are plugged into their ability, there is no cancellation. They will always have their hooks in you, and I doubt they would ever willingly sever such a connection,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s how this works?\u201d Han Sen asked seriously.\n\nLone Bamboo smiled and said, \u201cIf there is a race in this universe that can understand the Very High the most, it would be us\u2014the Sky. Although there is no real evidence, many generations of the Sky have worked for the Very High. This is a ninety percent accurate hypothesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf things are like that, then I wouldn\u2019t go no matter what,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod.\n\nHan Sen held the bottle of wine up for Lone Bamboo to have a few more sips. He asked, \u201cBut if you continue to refuse, will the Very High let you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lone Bamboo admitted with a shake of his head.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t ask anything further. He chatted with Lone Bamboo for a bit longer, and after he finished his wine, he left the prison.\n\nHan Sen was walking away, and as he did, he thought to himself, \u201cWhy would the Very High want Lone Bamboo so badly? There must be a way I can help him.\u201d He left the restricted area and saw a man sitting on a white crane. The man was smiling at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cUncle Yu.\u201d Han Sen raised his eyebrows at the sight of Yu Shanxin.\n\nYu Shanxin had gone to the lands occupied by the Dragons to save Han Sen once before. So, Han Sen was very polite whenever he saw the man.\n\nYu Shanxin smiled and said, \u201cWe should walk together, assuming that is okay with you.\u201d\u201cAre you coming for Lone Bamboo?\u201d Han Sen asked Yu Shanxin as he followed him.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m here for you,\u201d Yu Shanxin answered. That surprised Han Sen.\n\nBefore Han Sen said anything, Yu Shanxin went on to say, \u201cSky Palace made a deal with the Very High. So, whoever the Very High selects must go. If Lone Bamboo doesn\u2019t go, then we must find a worthy replacement.\n\n\u201cThat person you are suggesting can\u2019t be me, can it?\u201d Han Sen smiled wryly.\n\n\u201cAside from Lone Bamboo, the only other one of this generation that can impress the Very High is you,\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it, either,\u201d Han Sen said with a vigorous shake of his head. He didn\u2019t like running around naked any more than Lone Bamboo.\n\nYu Shanxin had expected Han Sen to react this way, and so he coldly said, \u201cI\u2019m sure Lone Bamboo filled you in on what the Very High are like. I waited until now to see you so that I wouldn\u2019t have to waste my breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Yu, you don\u2019t need to try to convince me. My thoughts on the matter are the same as Lone Bamboo\u2019s. I would rather go to prison than go to the Very High,\u201d Han Sen said with a shake of his head."
