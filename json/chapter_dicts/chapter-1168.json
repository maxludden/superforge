Do you have any last words?\u201d Qiu Ping showed no reluctance in his confrontation.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more for me to say. I did not do anything, but for the pain you have experienced, I can only provide you my condolence,\u201d Zhang Yuchen answered.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ll kill you, do you?\u201d Qiu Ping looked angry.\n\n\u201cWhen I said I did not do it, I did not do it,\u201d Zhang Yuchen said.\n\nHis complacent attitude fanned the flames of Qiu Ping\u2019s heart and temper. Without further ado, he slashed his sword towards Zhang Yuchen.\n\nZhang Yuchen knew he was going to die, and he did not want to fight the cruel twists of fate that had led him to that moment. He stood there and waited for the blow to strike.\n\nQiu Ping\u2019s blade was brought up to Zhang Yuchen neck, but it did not go any further. The sword nicked a small cut across the skin of his neck, and that was it.\n\n\u201cLet me ask you one more time; do you admit what you did or not?\u201d Qiu Ping asked.\n\n\u201cThat spirit spits poison in your ears. Recognize her for the forked tongue she really possesses and wake up!\u201d Zhang Yuchen proclaimed.\n\n\u201cEven now you try to drive a wedge between me and Smoke. D*mn you!\u201d Qiu Ping\u2019s anger only increased, and he was ready to strike his believed nemesis down.\n\nDong!\n\nA hazy longsword flashed before Qiu Ping\u2019s sword, and it shattered.\n\n\u201cIf the spirit was unharmed, why kill him? He has suffered down here, in the pits of this miserable place for many years. Isn\u2019t that suffering enough?\u201d Han Sen threw away the sword.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was small, but Taia and Phoenix Sword could not shrink with him. As such, he was using a mini beast soul weapon.\n\nHan Sen summoned a primitive class sword to block Qiu Ping\u2019s strike.\n\nHan Sen did not know the truth, as much as Qiu Ping did not either. But he knew Zhang Yuchen did not seem to be the sort to do what the allegations claimed he had.\n\nFurthermore, if Zhang Yuchen was as weak as he believed, it was difficult to imagine that he could force himself on a spirit or even kill her, as the story went.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Qiu Ping said.\n\nZhang Yuchen quickly said, \u201cThank you for your help, Brother Han, but this matter concerns the two of us and only the two of us.\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cI don\u2019t care for the petty reasons of your quarrel, but I do hope Mister Qiu will give me some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Qiu Ping asked.\n\n\u201cGive me time to prove Zhang Yuchen did not do anything wrong,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cAnd how would you do that?\u201d Qiu Ping said.\n\n\u201cGive me ten days. If I cannot prove his innocence to you in that time, you may do as you please,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWhy would I give you ten days?\u201d Qiu Ping looked intimidating.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want is to believe your best friend betrayed you as you are so sure he did. Give me ten days, and faith in your friend will not even be necessary. You will learn, know, and understand that he is a good person. He did not do what you think he did,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThat is not enough,\u201d Qiu Ping said.\n\n\u201cFine. Attack me ten times, one strike for each day. If you cannot kill me, give me the ten days I request,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cNo! You should not get yourself involved in this,\u201d Zhang Yuchen screamed. He believed Han Sen was new here and was not strong. He wholeheartedly believed Qiu Ping could end Han Sen\u2019s life with a single swing.\n\n\u201cAnd this is between me and Qiu Ping,\u201d Han Sen said, walking forward to directly face Qiu Ping. \u201cCome on; one strike for one day.\u201d\n\nQiu Ping drew his sword and slashed towards Han Sen. He was so fast, the ten attacks were like one. Everyone expected Han Sen to be cut up and diced like dinner.\n\n\u201cQiu Ping, come for me! Don\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Zhang Yuchen screamed.\n\nBut Qiu Ping was so fast, his attacks were already over before anyone heard what Zhang Yuchen had to say.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body had a few marks, and he was bleeding a little.\n\n\u201cI will see you in ten days. No one will be here to save you then.\u201d Qiu Ping returned his sword and left.\n\n\u201cHow did you withstand the ten of those attacks. I didn\u2019t even see you dodge them.\u201d Cheng Hu looked at Han Sen with great admiration.\n\nHan Sen looked at his wounds and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t bother dodging.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way! And he didn\u2019t kill you?\u201d Cheng Hu asked, in shock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because he is not completely heartless,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nCheng Hu then said, \u201cBut how will you be able to prove Brother Zhang\u2019s innocence in ten days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have to find out who is responsible for all this,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou want to find that spirit, don\u2019t you? She is in the highest level of the shelter, inside the palace. You won\u2019t get there,\u201d Cheng Hu said.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll get there.\u201d Han Sen spoke with confidence.\n\nHan Sen planned to get there so he could see Sky King, anyway. Helping them at the same time was a good excuse for others to see him ascend the ranks.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy? Not even Qiu Ping himself was able to reach the top! The top levels are occupied by super creatures and king spirits!\u201d Cheng Hu thought Han Sen was insane.\n\nHan Sen just smiled and said, \u201cQiu Ping\u2019s inability does not mean I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll succeed where he failed.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen walked towards the third floor.\n\nCheng Hu wished to say something more, but Zhang Yuchen pulled him back.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop me! That guy is nuts. We have to stop him from getting himself killed!\u201d Cheng Hu proclaimed.\n\nZhang Yuchen then said, \u201cCan you not see it? Brother Han is special.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow special? He\u2019s just a noob.\u201d It was when he said this that he realized Han Sen might not have been as green as he had been led to believe. After all, how could a newbie withstand Qiu Ping\u2019s attack?\n\n\u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go have a look,\u201d Cheng Hu said.\n\nZhang Yuchen could not go to the second level, so he was unable to follow."
