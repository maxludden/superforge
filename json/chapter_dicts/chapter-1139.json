Furthermore, Han Sen could hide his lifeforce.\n\nThe further they went, the more the smell intensified. Soon, a number of rock rats emerged, and their countless numbers made it difficult for the Blue Dinosaur to continue moving forward.\n\nEvery footstep of the Blue Dinosaur was met with the squelch of a number of rock rats being trampled underfoot.\n\nThe rock rats were very similar to ordinary rats. They were a little bigger than the average rat, with a disheveled grey look. They moved with a singular, focused purpose as they raced towards the scent, uncaring for their friends and brethren that were being killed unceremoniously by the dozen.\n\nAnd so, the Blue Dinosaur continued to accompany them. It carried on leading the way, following the endless stream of rats. It wasn\u2019t long before the tunnels they followed became wider and wider. Han Sen wondered how large that underground labyrinth might have actually been, as he knew he had only traversed a small portion of it thus far.\n\nThe underground realm was huge, and he got a better idea of just how big it was when the tunnel opened to a grand cavern. Their road now skirted a precarious cliffside, and down below, a lake stretched out to fill up what could have been an abyssal chasm. There was an abundance of waterfalls, feeding it from various spots across the landscape\n\nOn one side of this titan of a lake stood a tree. This tree was a goliath, and it stretched upwards and outwards. It was so wide and thick, one could easily believe it was supporting the entire underground region with the sturdy boughs that brushed against the ceiling of the cavern.\n\nThe roots at the bottom were like coiled, slumbering dragons. The branches high above all touched the ceiling.\n\nThe tree\u2019s actual color was dark and yellowish, and the leaves were of a similar color. It looked fairly ordinary, as such.\n\nBut the lifeforce the tree had was what immediately told Han Sen how special it actually was, and when his eyes first caught sight of the fruit that adorned those thick boughs, he was more than surprised.\n\nHan Sen had seen a lot of different geno plants in his time in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. He had seen the tree that gave birth to Disloyal Knight, which was magnificent. But all he had seen thus far paled in comparison to this tree underground. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the fruit it bore gave birth to genuine angels or demons.\n\nHis eyes became glued to the fruit of that tree. He couldn\u2019t stop staring at them. The fruit were like jellyfish, alive and flickering like lightbulbs.\n\nTheir tentacles waved up and down as if they were already underwater. They writhed and wriggled, ready to detach from the tree and float away.\n\nAcross the tree, there were thousands of them. If they could all yield a benefit for Han Sen, he thought it\u2019d be quite frightening.\n\n\u201cI wonder what the use of this fruit is,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nQueen was just as surprised as Han Sen was, as she bathed in the atmosphere and soaked in the landscape before them. The jellyfish fruit were of particular interest to her, and she could barely keep her eyes off them, as well.\n\nThe Blue Dinosaur began to drool, adding to the number of waterfalls that checkered the cavern. It was eager to get moving and visit the tree.\n\nThe rock rats were like a rapid river, as well, continuing to race there in unison.\n\nThe vermin were everywhere, and there was not a single vista left untarnished by their scruffy bodies. They spread out for at least a dozen miles, all packed together without an inch free.\n\nOn a pillar near the tree stood another rock rat. This was the king, and it stood on its pedestal with its eyes fixed on the jellyfish.\n\nAside from the rat king, though, no other rat was willing to remain too close to the lake and tree. While he observed the rats, Han Sen noticed a shadow below the waters. It lurked, waiting.\n\nHe wondered what it might have been, but there was plenty of space near the roots of the tree it could have occupied. No rock rat was getting that close, after all.\n\nOn the east side of the tree, the area looked to be on fire. Han Sen saw giant red toads there, impatiently ribbeting and jumping, waiting for the jellyfish to be theirs.\n\nThere was one particular toad that stood out to Han Sen. It was a giant red one, as big as a rhino. Han Sen didn\u2019t need to use the dongxuan aura to determine that it was a super class creature.\n\nOn the west side of the tree, there was a collective of black bugs. They were unfamiliar to Han Sen.\n\nThey were each the size of a fist, and they looked like crickets. Their antennas looked surprisingly sturdy.\n\nTheir eyes creepily clashed against their black bodies, and as they waited, they produced a sharp and irritating noise. At the front of this group was a cricket that was bigger than the rest, equal to the size of a fully-grown cat. As it waited, it remained silent.\n\n\u201cAnother super creature,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBut that couldn\u2019t have been all. Han Sen could detect the presence of many stronger lifeforces observing the fruit, waiting for their opportunity to snag a prize.\n\nWhen the fruit became mature, it wouldn\u2019t just be the three clans of super creatures battling for it.\n\nIn fear of what might happen, Han Sen did not allow the Blue Dinosaur to get too close to the tree. Despite its appetite, the Blue Dinosaur was willing to adhere to its master\u2019s commands.\n\nThere were too many rock rats, though, and they continued to appear fearless and uncaring for the Blue Dinosaur. But it wasn\u2019t just the rats like this, either. None of the other creatures in the vicinity appeared to want a fight.\n\nThe jellyfish fruit were more captivating than anything else in existence at that point in time.\n\nStrangely, though, no creature wanted to get too close to the tree.\n\nHan Sen did not share their fears, if fear was what stayed them. So, he ventured closer to the tree in deep observation. The jellyfish were living up to their namesake, shimmering and wobbling like jelly. Han Sen really wanted to give them a nibble.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s face changed when he viewed one of the branches of the Mother Tree up close.\n\nOn the branch, Han Sen saw a human shadow.\n\nNo creature dared venture close to the tree, but as for what was amongst those boughs right now, Han Sen could not hazard a guess."
