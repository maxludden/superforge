He might even be stronger than a Very High of the same level. Who is he?\u201d Li Xue Cheng asked, not taking his eyes off the video of Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHe is the silkworm Exquisite selected. His name is Han Sen, and he is a crystallizer,\u201d Liyu Zhen answered.\n\n\u201cI think Exquisite is very lucky to have gotten a silkworm like this,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said with a nod.\n\nLiyu Zhen smiled and said, \u201cWhat does it have to do with us if she had good luck? To be straight with you, she is a very precious person amongst the Very High. We, on the other hand, are just breeding machines.\u201d\n\nSeeing Li Xue Cheng frown, Liyu Zhen said, \u201cAfter seeing this video, do you not have any opinions to share on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Li Xue Cheng frowned again.\n\n\u201cWhen Li Keer gets her silkworm, the fights between silkworms will start. There are thirteen silkworms in total. So, which of them do you think is going to win?\u201d Liyu Zhen asked.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can see here, Han Sen seems pretty good. But he is just a King class with nine tiers. Most of the silkworms are half-deified. One of them was even born deified. Judging from the power I have witnessed, I think the born-deified is the most likely to win,\u201d Li Xue Cheng quietly said.\n\n\u201cYour reasoning is sound, but I have analyzed Han Sen and the other silkworms. Han Sen is amazingly strong, and he has many treasures. He even possesses the true god weapon Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. I think he has a high chance of winning.\u201d After Liyu Zhen was embarrassed in the star tree contest, he had taken the time to investigate and learn more about Han Sen. He now knew more about Han Sen than most of the Very High did.\n\nOuter Sky had many resources, so the Very High never lacked anything. They only ventured out into the rest of the universe to find silkworms and people with peculiar talents.\n\nSo, the Very High paid little attention to most of the races in the universe, and Han Sen was just a King. Even an ordinary deified wouldn\u2019t garner much attention from the Very High.\n\nLiyu Zhen passed the information he had collected on Han Sen over to Li Xue Cheng. The file included a video of Han Sen using the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze to turn Meng Lie into a statue.\n\n\u201cThis actually happened?\u201d Li Xue Cheng was shocked. He went quiet, and then he said, \u201cIf this video is real, he does stand a chance of winning the battle between silkworms. It is just a chance, mind you. His victory definitely isn\u2019t guaranteed. After all, using the power of a treasure doesn\u2019t make you as good as a real deified. There is still a big difference in level. But if he can use a weapon like the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, he might actually win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if this silkworm fight bars the use of treasures?\u201d Liyu Zhen suddenly laughed.\n\n\u201cWith his power, of course, he cannot challenge a genuine deified. The video demonstrated clearly that he couldn\u2019t kill the deified star beetle no matter how strong he was. His power is no match for a deified yet. His skill will matter little in the face of such absolute power.\u201d Li Xue Cheng paused and said, \u201cBut the fight between silkworms doesn\u2019t prohibit the use of treasures.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t in the past, but this time will be different. I have a reliable source with sway in this matter. This time, the silkworm fights will ban the use of treasures,\u201d Liyu Zhen said with confidence.\n\n\u201cDid your family member\u2026\u201d Li Xue Cheng seemed to have guessed something unsavory about Liyu Zhen. But before he finished speaking, he thought better of it and closed his mouth.\n\nLiyu Zhen smiled. \u201cYou just need to know that this silkworm fight won\u2019t allow the use of treasures. That is all. Right now, there are only four people who know about this. And you and I cannot tell anyone. The other two won\u2019t tell, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does this have to do with us?\u201d Li Xue Cheng still didn\u2019t understand what the other man meant.\n\n\u201cDid you forget?\u201d Liyu Zhen asked coldly. \u201cSilkworm fights are normally so boring, but this one will be rather interesting. If you send out information about Han Sen, do you think others will be like us and believe Han Sen will win the silkworm bouts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might be possible\u2026 After all, the born deified silkworm is just primitive. He is actually weaker than Meng Lie. With his treasures, Han Sen would probably win,\u201d Li Xue Cheng quietly said. As he spoke, his eyes brightened. He finally understood what Liyu Zhen had been implying all along.\n\n\u201cYou want everyone to gamble and place their bets on Han Sen, so you can take their money?\u201d Li Xue Cheng\u2019s eyes flashed with interest.\n\n\u201cYes. And after everyone loses because of their faith in Han Sen, do you think they will be nice to him?\u201d Liyu Zhen laughed.\n\n\u201cYou are so evil. You\u2019ll be ripping off many people with resources, people that Han Sen might have to visit. If they don\u2019t like him, it might be hard for him to earn resources,\u201d Li Xue Cheng said, understanding.\n\n\u201cI, Liyu Zhen, won\u2019t allow something stolen from me to remain stolen.\u201d Liyu Zhen chuckled darkly. Then he said to Li Xue Cheng, \u201cThey will soon announce that this silkworm fight will ban the use of treasures, so you better move quickly. We need people to place their wagers before the news circulates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seems like quite the opportunity. Why don\u2019t you do this yourself? Why did you have to bring me into this?\u201d Li Xue Cheng asked, somewhat befuddled.\n\n\u201cI have a background with him,\u201d Liyu Zhen said, shaking his head. \u201cIf I bet that Han Sen will lose, people will grow suspicious. You don\u2019t know him, however. We can share this business half and half.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right. With your relationship to Han Sen, if you bet that he will lose, they will know that there must be something going on behind the scenes.\u201d Li Xue Cheng laughed and said, \u201cSure. Then it\u2019s settled.\u201d\n\nInformation about Han Sen soon spread across the Very High. The Very High became interested in him, aside from those that studied Very High Sense, of course. They simply didn\u2019t say anything. Most of the Very High believed Han Sen had a chance of winning the silkworm fight, as a result.\n\nLi Xue Cheng was able to use this opportunity to make lots of wagers with the Very High.\n\nThe results were just as Liyu Zhen had predicted, as well. Soon after the last of the bets came in, the Very High leader announced that the silkworms wouldn\u2019t be allowed to treasures in the bouts. Many of the Very High thought Li Xue Cheng had scammed them, and they hated Han Sen, too.\n\nThings would be fine if Han Sen won the silkworm fight, but if he didn\u2019t win, many of the Very High would lose their money because of him. Even though Han Sen was completely innocent in this scheme, he was affected.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know that any of this had happened. He continued fishing in Underworld Lake, and after ten days, he returned to the star tree.\n\nThe old man under the tree was gone. Han Sen took over the guardianship of the tree. He spent some time searching through the tree\u2019s branches, but he found no more pesky star beetles occupying the tree. It seemed as if the old man had cleared them before he left.\n\n\u201cThe star beetle swarms come every two to three months. You don\u2019t have to stay here all the time. Only come when the bugs arrive. Then, you just have to kill them,\u201d Exquisite said to Han Sen."
