He was mesmerized by the sea that hung overhead, with fish swimming below its glittering waves as if all was normal.\n\nHan Sen thought the primary threat would be those sea creatures.\n\nOrdinary super creatures could not force them away from the ground, but the presence of a berserk super creature could always rattle them enough to find themselves plunging upwards.\n\nHan Sen strode across the ground as the fish king escorted them from above. It made Han Sen wonder if the Endless Sea\u2019s power was true. After all, the fish king seemed to be unconcerned.\n\n\u201cFish King, catch me!\u201d Han Sen wanted to see what would happen if he jumped.\n\nFish King lined up with Han Sen, so he could cushion the fall and be a vessel for Han Sen to sail upon.\n\nThen, after his feet left the ground, he felt an invisible force tug him upwards to the sea.\n\nHe felt as if gravity was turned on its head and flipped, but then he had trouble re-orienting himself. Bao\u2019er also made sure to go with him. Han Sen used Jadeskin, but he still fell fast. Han Sen grabbed Bao\u2019er and aimed at the fish king\u2019s back, making sure not to miss.\n\nAfter landing, Han Sen was above the sea. It was like the blue sky and the earth had traded places with each other.\n\nIt was a strange and rather amusing thing, watching Lotus Empress walk on the ground. To him, she was treading a ceiling upside down.\n\n\u201cLet fish king take us! It\u2019s faster this way,\u201d Han Sen called out to her, to hurry along the proceedings.\n\nLotus Empress thought it would be best, too, so she jumped up/down and landed on the fish king\u2019s back.\n\nThe red bird still frequented Bao\u2019er\u2019s company, and it had tagged along for this little adventure. It fluttered its little wings and lifted itself to hover above the baby\u2019s head. Then, it transformed itself into a fish and swam alongside the fish king.\n\nAfter turning into a fish and taking a brief swim, it hopped out of the water, turned back into a bird, and flew back to its perch on Bao\u2019er\u2019s head.\n\nHan Sen was surprised as he had been the first time he found the little creature, quite surprised something could wholly transform like that.\n\nIt had kept following Han Sen and Bao\u2019er for the longest time, ever since it was first found in the pond with Xie Qing King. But aside from the ability to transform between a bird and a fish, it hadn\u2019t proven useful in any other capacity. It was pretty much a useless tagalong.\n\nThe fish king continued taking them to the island they wished to reach, but after a while, a sudden shadow coursed below the waves.\n\nThe fish king swung its tail, firing a gold light into the sea. Then it took itself airborne.\n\nThere was a big, seemingly hostile creature tailing the fish king. It looked like a shark with two heads, and it had left the water in a similar flight, too.\n\nUnfortunately, its intelligence was lacking. It tried to bite the fish king. It was only a super creature with nine gene locks open, so it was a futile attempt from the get-go.\n\nThe fish king swung its tail to smack the creature away, and it was reminiscent of an old-fashioned face-slapping. Mind you, it was stronger than the average one. And it occurred multiple times until the nasty squelch of a broken watermelon sounded. One of the heads was broken.\n\nThe other shark head screamed in a display of fright. Then it tried to swim away.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to let it go, though. He finished the job with a sword, lopping the second head clean off.\n\n\u201cSuper Creature Two-Headed Shark killed. No beast soul gained. The flesh of this creature is inedible, but you may harvest its Life Geno Essence. Consume its Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wanted to grab its Life Geno Essence, but the fish was sinking very fast. It was sinking far faster than was normal, as if it had been latched to an abyssal vortex that dragged it down quick.\n\nThe bird suddenly turned back into a fish, though. Then it dove into the sea.\n\nNot long after, the fish came back with a Life Geno Essence in its mouth.\n\n\u201cNot bad. It looks like you\u2019re good for something, at least.\u201d Han Sen was surprised, as not even the fish king was willing to go down for it.\n\nThe fish turned back into a bird and landed on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, then it tweeted to him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s return to the ground. If something bad happens to the fish king, there\u2019s nowhere we\u2019ll be able to stand,\u201d Lotus said.\n\nHan Sen nodded in agreement, then the fish king flew up and delivered them to the land. After landing, the gravity was switched. It was the sea that was overhead now.\n\nThe fish king returned to the sea and continued following them, just in case it had to catch them. After a half day of travel, nothing else bothered them.\n\nBut suddenly, a large group of fish came swimming their way.\n\nThey kept on jumping up towards the surface. They looked like three-meter-long swordfish, but they behaved like hungry piranhas.\n\n\u201cAre they coming to us?\u201d Han Sen wondered with a frown.\n\n\u201cThey are the Endless Swordfish; quite common. Their ranks range from ordinary to super class, but they aren\u2019t hostile. There must be a reason why they\u2019re all scrambling in this direction, though.\u201d Lotus Empress was frowning, too."
