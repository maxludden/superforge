    "text": "\u201cBarr is getting stronger!\u201d Qing Li had finally seen the problem that Han Sen was having. Barr\u2019s increase in strength was becoming obvious to all of the onlookers. And Han Sen\u2019s power remained what it was, not increasing at all.\n\nAfter the power increase, Han Sen was suppressed. All he could do was keep dodging. He couldn\u2019t fight Barr anymore.\n\nQing Li became very worried that there might not be a ceiling to Barr\u2019s increase of strength. Even if Han Sen used all of his power, if he couldn\u2019t avoid Barr\u2019s strikes, he could be killed in one shot.\n\nA Destroyed Duke laughed and said, \u201cBarr is invincible against those who are of the same level as him. And Han Sen is only a Marquise. He might be strong, but a Marquise is just a Marquise. He\u2019s offended Barr, so death is his fate, now.\u201d\n\nHan Meng\u2019er, Zero, and Little Angel were watching intently. They hadn\u2019t said a word thus far. It was usually a noisy affair when women got together, but the three of them weren\u2019t the fondest of speaking. So, none of them said a word as they watched.\n\nLittle Silver and Little Star were standing with them. They, too, watched quietly.\n\n\u201cUp.\u201d Han Sen suddenly leaped upwards and used his knifetip to press forward. A purple knife silk appeared in the air, thinner than a strand of hair. Barr was trapped and tangled up inside the knife silk. He was no longer able to move.\n\nBarr\u2019s fire was still growing. He looked at Han Sen with eyes full of rage. His motionless body began to expand, but he couldn\u2019t sever the incredibly soft yet durable knife silks. The knife silks dug into his flesh, making the man bleed profusely all over.\n\nBarr laughed. He cared nothing for the wounds he was incurring. He fought back with all his strength, laughing the entire time. And then, there was a katcha! He exerted too much strength, and the knife silks cut him to pieces.\n\nBut, a second later, those broken limbs were reconnected once more. Barr was standing again, and his body looked even scarier now.\n\nThis guy is pretty hard to deal with. I could totally annihilate his body with Super Spank, but I really shouldn\u2019t use it with so many people watching.\u201d Han Sen frowned. His mind raced for a way to get rid of Barr.\n\nBarr was powerful, and the Destroyed said Barr was the strongest Duke.\n\nHan Sen did not believe the man was invincible, though. Perhaps Barr was the best out of the Destroyed, but Han Sen did not believe that any random genius in the geno universe could overwhelm his power. Especially not someone who was a Duke.\n\nThe bodies of the Dragon were strong and powerful. This was especially true of the King class ones. Barr\u2019s body might have been powerful, but not to a degree that elicited fear. His power was limited, and that was why he had been forced to escape from Dragon One. There was nothing to suggest he was actually invincible.\n\n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Barr crooned. \u201cThank you so much. Thank you for letting me enjoy such a delicious fight\u2026 The moment I kill you will be the best moment of my life!\u201d\n\nBarr was crazy. Every strike carried an endless murderous presence.\n\nMany black and red knife flames rose in the air, crossing over each other. Every scrape across the ground left behind a large knife mark.\n\nBarr\u2019s power and speed were better than any others of the same level. It was likely only a small handful of Dukes that had what it took to fight him now.\n\n\u201cSo strong!\u201d Han Sen complimented his enemy. He also had to admit that if he did not make use of Super Spank, defeating his opponent would be impossible until he was a Duke.\n\nBlowing him into pieces via Break Six Skies would be a futile endeavor, as well. The enemy would survive, and end up even stronger.\n\nBy the way Barr was getting stronger, Han Sen could guess that Barr was using his own injuries for power. The harder Han Sen struck him, the stronger he became.\n\nBut he could also tell that the power Barr had absorbed from him wasn\u2019t permanent. If it was permanent, Barr wouldn\u2019t have been damaged so easily upon their first encounter.\n\nWhen he first saw Barr, Han Sen noticed that his power was not all that higher than the average Duke. He was nothing special amongst them.\n\nBut right now, Barr was ranking amongst the best of the Dukes. To continue fighting this way would only give him even more strength.\n\n\u201cIt is useless. No matter how hard he tries, Han Sen is going to die.\u201d Many of the Destroyed were smiling. If Barr could kill Han Sen, it\u2019d be a notable boost for the Destroyed.\n\nHan Sen could not kill his enemy, and neither could he risk injuring him. He was getting pretty desperate.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d Barr\u2019s bone knife kept on swinging. The power it carried was enough to sunder mountains. It struck Han Sen\u2019s head.\n\nThe bone knife met no resistance, and it went clean through Han Sen\u2019s head. Then, Han Sen\u2019s body exploded like a water balloon. It was another one of his Moon doppelgangers.\n\nThe real Han Sen was now standing right next to Barr. His hair was close enough to touch Barr\u2019s face.\n\nHan Sen smiled at Barr, and he said, \u201cYou are strong. Unreasonably strong. I cannot kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut of course, I am going to kill you.\u201d Barr swung his knife with the aim of cutting Han Sen in half.\n\nHan Sen moved as smoothly as the wind, while Barr\u2019s bone knife whistled through the air after him. But there was still a distance between the knife and Han Sen. It felt as if some invisible waves were enabling Han Sen to evade the bone knife.\n\n\u201cI cannot kill you, but I can still beat you!\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\n\u201cI think he is crazy. If he cannot kill Barr, then how can he defeat him?\u201d A Destroyed Duke grunted repeatedly.\n\nAs this was happening, Han Sen raised a pistol with the word \u201cSpell\u201d scrawled across it. He aimed it at Barr\u2019s body and pulled the trigger.\n\nPang!\n\nA bullet whizzed out of the gun and struck Barr\u2019s forehead.\n\nThe bullet hit Barr\u2019s forehead and disintegrated into dust. It left a red mark and a spell behind.\n\n\u201cThis skill again? I have told you already, and I can tell you again: your sealing powers won\u2019t work on me while I have my chaos powers.\u201d Barr looked at his foe with disdain and roared. He used his knife to try to attack Han Sen again.\n\nBut after he brought his knife up, his faces went blank. A light sheet of ice began to seep from his forehead, and it started to spread across his entire body. Before he could wipe it away, his body was completely frozen. He looked like an ice statue, sculpted into the shape of a person about to strike."
