    "text": "Her eyes brightened with interest.\n\nEmpty God\u2019s lips curled up at the corners. He looked cocky as he said, \u201cDo you want it? Just say you want it and it is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked surprised. She gazed at Empty God with disbelief.\n\n\u201cOf course. As long as you say what you want, a cute little girl like you can have anything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Empty God said chivalrously, his voice smooth and coaxing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a great guy!\u201d Bao\u2019er said with excitement.\n\nEmpty God laughed. He held the gem in front of Bao\u2019er and smiled. \u201cJust say you want it, and this gem will then belong to you.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er looked longingly at the gem, and her hands slowly reached out for the gem.\n\nEmpty God hid a snide smile as he thought to himself, \u201cFemale creatures are all alike. They are just like those ugly dragons. No matter how old they are, they love all things shiny.\u201d\n\nBut Bao\u2019er suddenly pulled her hand back. With a look of disappointment, she said, \u201cI actually don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why do you suddenly not want it?\u201d Empty God asked in surprise. He had been caught off guard when the girl changed her mind.\n\n\u201cMom says that I can\u2019t take gifts from strangers.\u201d Bao\u2019er\u2019s face looked very serious when she said this, but her eyes were still locked on the gem. It looked as if she was struggling to keep herself from reaching out and taking it.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Empty God said with a smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t accept things from strangers, of course. But I\u2019m not a stranger. I\u2019m a good friend of your father. You can take something from me because of that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a good friend of my father?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, her eyebrows rising.\n\n\u201cYes. We are very, very good friends.\u201d When Empty God said that, the words he spoke were stressed. Each word was pronounced heavier than the last.\n\n\u201cIf you are Dad\u2019s good friend, then we really aren\u2019t strangers!\u201d Bao\u2019er said happily.\n\n\u201cOf course we aren\u2019t!\u201d Empty God said with a shake of his head.\n\n\u201cThank you, Uncle. In that case, I\u2019m going to take the gem.\u201d Bao\u2019er reached out her hand to grab the gem in Empty God\u2019s hands.\n\nAs she reached toward it, Empty God wasn\u2019t sure if he should let it go or continue holding onto it. Bao\u2019er hadn\u2019t declared her wish yet. If she took it now, Empty God wouldn\u2019t receive anything in return.\n\nEmpty God didn\u2019t respond, and Bao\u2019er stared at him with confusion. She said, \u201cUncle, do you not want to give me the gem? If that is so, then that is fine. Mom told me not to steal other people\u2019s items, anyway.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s words might have been gracious, but her face was filled with disdain. She thought Empty God was very cheap by not giving her the gem.\n\n\u201cAhem, ahem. You still haven\u2019t told me whether or not you want it,\u201d Empty God said. He was looking a bit uncomfortable now.\n\n\u201cUncle, this gem is obviously important to you. You should keep it for yourself.\u201d With those words, Bao\u2019er lowered her hand and turned around to leave.\n\nAlthough she didn\u2019t say anything more, she had a look of scorn as she turned away. It made Empty God feel more depressed than he had in a long time.\n\nHe was Empty God, but he was despised by a child.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go, Bao\u2019er! Your uncle was planning on giving you this gem as a gift. I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. You should take it from me now.\u201d Empty God didn\u2019t really care about the gem, and giving it to Bao\u2019er might allow him to gain her trust. He wasn\u2019t going to let her run off so easily.\n\n\u201cYou are really going to give it to me? Aren\u2019t you going to miss it?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked wonderingly up at Empty God.\n\n\u201cTo me, this gem is just a measly rock. It is worthless compared to the other things in my possession.\u201d Empty God placed the gem in Bao\u2019er\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThank you, Uncle. You are a good guy.\u201d Bao\u2019er held the gem and smiled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d Empty God smiled, but on the inside, he was thinking, \u201cI was worried you wouldn\u2019t take it. Now that you\u2019ve fallen into the habit of taking things that I offer, this should be easy.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er really liked the gem. She focused her attention on it carefully as she played with it.\n\nEmpty God reached into his pocket and brought out another gem that was even bigger and prettier than the first. He said, \u201cBao\u2019er, do you not think this gem is even prettier? Would you like it?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er looked at the gem in Empty God\u2019s hand. It was as large as a man\u2019s fist. She blinked at the sight of it and said, \u201cIt is way too big. I\u2019d feel rather snobby if I had it. I like this one more.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Bao\u2019er went back to playing with the gem in her hands, completely ignoring Empty God.\n\nEmpty God felt depressed. He had assumed that offering a bigger and prettier gem would get Bao\u2019er to put blind faith in him. Instead, however, the gem had led to his abandonment.\n\n\u201cIt looks like using gems to attract Bao\u2019er will no longer work.\u201d Empty God rolled his eyes and came up with something new.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, look at this.\u201d Empty God stepped over to Bao\u2019er and pulled out something to show her.\n\nBao\u2019er was sitting atop the Star Fruit, but she raised her head to take a look. Empty God was holding an old bronze mirror. The mirror was only ten centimeters long, and it looked very delicate.\n\nThe front was smooth and glossy. On the back of the mirror, lines spread from the center of the mirror to its edges, like a sundial or a compass. Strange symbols were etched in each space between the lines.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked Empty God with curiosity. The man was holding the mysterious mirror out so that she could see it.\n\n\u201cThis is the Star Gauge Mirror. It is a true god-class treasure. This device will allow you to see the past and the future,\u201d Empty God said, lavishing praises on the old mirror he was now presenting. Although he was embellishing what it was capable of, the mirror really was quite special. Empty God had wanted the mirror badly, and it had taken him a lot of time and effort to get his hands on it.\n\nEmpty God and King Jun called themselves God, but they couldn\u2019t make something out of nothing. Everything that they could use or control already existed in the universe in some form. They couldn\u2019t just magically conjure up any item they wanted.\n\nThat Star Gauge Mirror was a precious treasure that had come from a true god elite who had lived a billion years ago. Empty God had struggled to lure that true god elite for hundreds of years before the elite fell into his trap. The elite made a wish, and Empty God stole the elite\u2019s lifespan. He also gained control of the Star Gauge Mirror.\n\nEmpty God was very proud of what he had accomplished. There had been another God that was also trying to trick the true god, but he had failed. Empty God had claimed the victory and the treasure. So, even though the mirror might have been useless, he still carried it around with him. Now, it presented a perfect opportunity to trick Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cIs the mirror really that powerful?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked in disbelief.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is. Just watch it,\u201d Empty God said. His hands pressed against the Star Gauge Mirror, manipulating the symbols on the back.\n\nA flickering light appeared on the surface of the old mirror. After a while, the light resolved into a slightly unsteady image, like a show playing on an old TV.\n\nThe Star Tree stood in the center of the image. There were a bunch of Star Beetles swarming over the tree like an ocean wave. Han Sen was fighting those Star Beetles.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Bao\u2019er realized that it was an image of Han Sen participating in the test at the Star Tree."
