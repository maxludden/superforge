It made him very pleased.\n\n\u201cMy ability to refine Life Geno Essences has greatly improved, following the unlock of the Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s sixth gene lock,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he continued his practice.\n\n\u201cLife Geno Essence absorbed: super geno points +1.\u201d\n\nA little while later again, the familiar voice sounded.\n\nHan Sen stayed in his room most of the day, focused on the refinement and absorption of the Life Geno Essences he had accumulated thus far. He was able to fully refine each Life Geno Essence he had collected, aside from the Invisible King Scorpion\u2019s.\n\nAfter opening his sixth gene lock, his absorption powers were much stronger.\n\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d he exclaimed, realizing how many Life Geno Essences he had been able to absorb.\n\nIn total, Han Sen\u2019s super geno point tally had reached twenty-four. Now that he was able to quickly absorb the Life Geno Essences of super creatures, he could focus on hunting them down to max his stats out in the near future.\n\nHan Sen: Super Body Super King Spirit\n\nLevel: Surpasser\n\nLife-Span: 400\n\nEvolution Requirement: 100 geno points\n\nOwned Geno Points: 100 ordinary geno points, 100 primitive geno points, 100 mutant geno points, 100 sacred-blood geno points, 24 super geno points\n\nHan Sen guessed his fitness level must have been around the twenty-five hundred mark. He wasn\u2019t far-off possessing the strength of a super creature himself. Han Sen gobbled up some more walnuts and returned to Immortal Shelter. There, he took the time to speak with Zhang Yuchen.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen returned to the fifth floor. He summoned Dragon King and asked him, \u201cI\u2019m on the highest floor; how are you going to find the tree for me?\u201d\n\nDragon King sniffed around his new environment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t smell the Sky Tree. You\u2019re going to have to take me for a walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for that right now. I need to go pick up Sky Fruit with Dry Bone King later.\u201d\n\nHan Sen then proceeded to tell Dragon King what Dry Bone King had told him.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. The tree might be dead, but at least the fruit can mature. With the competition, getting it will be difficult, though. The nuts you mill were most likely from the Sky Fruit. Only Sky King is privy to whatever the powder does, it would appear.\u201d\n\nDragon King then went on to say, \u201cSky King is very generous, allowing you to have as much as you want, leaving him only the nuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else I should know about the fruit?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen had eaten many of the other walnuts, and save for the shell and nut inside, there didn\u2019t appear to be anything special about them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it has to be some good stuff. Dry Bone King wouldn\u2019t be working for Sky King, otherwise.\u201d Dragon King then pointed at Han Sen and resumed his dialogue, \u201cEach fruit is bound to contain a geno treasure of sorts, an item that is super-class, for sure. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could procure some?\u201d\n\nHan Sen started to say something but frowned before he could. He noticed a note had been left on his table, one that had been written in the human language.\n\n\u201cIf you wish to stay alive, follow Qing Jun.\u201d Han Sen read the words and continued to stare at the paper.\n\nHe was the only human capable of reaching the fifth floor. So, he wondered, how had someone left that note for him?\n\n\u201cDid Dry Bone King leave this for me?\u201d Han Sen frowned. Dry Bone King was the only one he had met since arriving on the fifth floor.\n\nBut Dry Bone King wasn\u2019t a fan of Qing Jun and her wicked ways, either. Why would he tell Han Sen to follow her? Han Sen turned the paper over and was given a shock.\n\nOn the back of the paper was a symbol drawn in red. It was a large picture of the Nine-Life Cat.\n\n\u201cSomeone from Blood Legion is on the fifth floor? That can\u2019t be right! There aren\u2019t any other humans strong enough to get here.\u201d Han Sen was truly taken aback, not having a clue how this had come about.\n\n\u201cWas it Dry Bone King?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think it was possible, or at the very least extremely unlikely.\n\nBlood Legion was a human organization with a murky, sordid past. Still, it was human, through and through, and neither spirits nor super creatures would be members of it.\n\nDry Bone King arrived shortly after, looking for Han Sen. He was accompanied by another king spirit.\n\nHis name was Baby Ghost, and his appearance amused Han Sen. The spirit had a head that was enlarged like a baby\u2019s, but the body was skinny, frail, and extremely small.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t notice a change in Dry Bone King\u2019s behavior, which suggested it was unlikely he was the one who left the note. Han Sen then wondered if it was Qing Jun herself who had left it. Perhaps it was some sort of weird trick of hers, as she wasn\u2019t exactly the most sound-minded individual.\n\nBut if that was true, how could she have known about Blood Legion and Han Sen\u2019s connection to it?\n\nAs Han Sen mulled this over, Dry Bone King led Han Sen to the plaza. When they arrived, a female king spirit was there waiting for them. She was accompanied by seven super creatures.\n\nQing Jun King did not even look at Han Sen, and simply approached the Sky Fruit.\n\nThe path ahead had been built by the spirits and creatures of the fourth floor, but they weren\u2019t allowed to accept the fruit. If they even so much as stumbled across one during their time of building, they\u2019d have been outright killed."
