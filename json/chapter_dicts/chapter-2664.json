    "text": "\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell him about all the bets that have been placed on his performance?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the point in him knowing that? Are we going to make him fight for his life against a born-deified? I don\u2019t want to have to find another silkworm,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Li Keer said, tilting her head in acknowledgment. \u201cIt is impossible for a King to beat a born-deified. Plus, that deified has no lack of talent himself. He\u2019s as good as a student of the Very High. It won\u2019t be easy for anyone to win against him, and Han Sen is just a ninth-tier King.\u201d\n\nLi Keer sighed and continued, \u201cThe people who have placed big bets on Han Sen\u2014who believed he would earn first place\u2014are going to lose the items they have wagered. They won\u2019t be able to do anything against Li Xue Cheng. They\u2019ll definitely take out their anger on Han Sen, even if they don\u2019t hold him personally responsible. Wherever he goes, I\u2019m sure trouble will follow close behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is something that cannot be avoided. We just have to find a way to sort this out, or at least mitigate the fallout,\u201d Exquisite glumly said.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen spent some time reviewing the information he had been given. There descriptions and short bios of the twelve silkworms he would be squaring off against. The information was comprehensive, and whoever had been responsible for compiling it had done an excellent job. It was like a bona fide restaurant menu.\n\nThere was an image of every silkworm in the documents he received, too. Han Sen saw the born-deified fellow on the first page.\n\nShale: Lionheart Mutant\n\nLevel: Primitive Deified\n\nSex: Male\n\nPrimary Geno Arts: Lion Killer\n\nHobbies and Interests: Dessert\n\nThe content of the documents was very detailed, but most of the information was also pointless for Han Sen\u2019s purposes. He didn\u2019t need to know the hobbies of his competition. He didn\u2019t need to know what color of armor they wore or the things they liked to do for fun. There was no mention of their powers. All he learned was that the deified had a geno art called Lion Killer.\n\n\u201cSo far, reading this is no help at all.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nHan Sen kept on reading, and he noticed that every profile was the same. When he flipped over to the fourth contestant, he saw the description of Yu Shanxin. Again, the introduction was the same. It only described his looks and the fact that he was skilled in the Extreme Evil Path. That was about it.\n\nHan Sen kept flipping through the profiles, page by page. He memorized the faces of the silkworms, their names, and their races. The other information was useless for him to remember.\n\nHan Sen flipped through the character information and reached the last page. There, he saw his own profile.\n\nHan Sen: Crystallizer (serving Sky Palace)\n\nLevel: Ninth-tier King\n\nSex: Male\n\nPrimary Geno Arts: The Story of Genes, Teeth Knife, Under the Sky knife skills\u2026\n\nOwned treasures: Charming God\u2019s Jian, the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, unknown feather clothes, unknown bow\u2026\n\n\u201cWait, what is this?\u201d Han Sen was frozen. The information he had on the other silkworms was practically useless. But the profile on him was surprisingly detailed. It said everything quite clearly, and explicitly mentioned the treasures he wielded. It even separated each one to describe each geno art and treasure in a grossly detailed fashion. It was all so very elaborate.\n\n\u201cWho created this d*mn folder? Why has the writer only gone and exposed my powers?\u201d Han Sen felt as if he wanted to kill someone. He didn\u2019t know anything about his enemies, but the enemies knew everything about him. This was bullcrap.\n\nAt the end of the information, there was a summary. \u201cThe genius that can suppress thousands of races that composed the fabric of the wonderful universe we live in. The one that stands out the most can become the greatest silkworm. Aside from Shale, who we know can fight, the other has yet to be decided. He is the most popular winner in the silkworm bouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou motherf*cker.\u201d After reading the summary, Han Sen felt fairly sure that he had been set up.\n\nHan Sen flipped through the book a few more times. He finally saw the last sentence at the back of the book, too, then. It said, \u201cEditor: Li Xue Cheng.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this Li Xue Cheng? Why is he turning everyone against me?\u201d Han Sen wondered, bewildered. He didn\u2019t recall encountering a man that went by that name before. In fact, he\u2019d only met a few of the Very High since he arrived in Outer Sky. He didn\u2019t know anyone called Li Xue Cheng, so there was no way he had offended him.\n\n\u201cAre Li Xue Cheng and Liyu Zhen working together?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself. Aside from Liyu Zhen, he could think of no other person of the Very High who would want to see him down like this.\n\nThinking of this, Han Sen was given a shock. He realized that the silkworms bouts wouldn\u2019t be as easy as he initially presumed.\n\nHan Sen flipped back through the folder and read the details of his opponents again and again. They were all top-class fighters. There were many of the Extreme King there, and Yu Shanxin was one of the Sky.\n\nAnd in regards to Shale, who was a Lionheart, it was actually a nameless race. There was only one half-deified among his people. Shale just so happened to be the son of that half-deified, but for some reason, there was a gene mutation when he was born. It led to him becoming deified. He was extraordinarily talented.\n\nAfter the God Spirit Touch\u2019s test, he was registered as a ten armor talent. Following his lead, the race of the Lionhearts had gained wider renown. If he hadn\u2019t been selected by one of the Very High students to become a silkworm, he would have been planning a fight for a lantern.\n\nShale was chosen to be a silkworm four years ago. He had been practicing in Outer Sky for a long time, and he was so talented\u2026 With all that extra time to practice and refine those talents, it was easy to imagine how scary he would be as an opponent.\n\n\u201cIf I can use treasures, I\u2019ll definitely be able to beat Shale and reach first place. If I can\u2019t use treasures, then I will fail to defeat Shale, and possibly all the other silkworms as well. Even setting aside the others, I\u2019ll have to fight Yu Shanxin. That guy will be very hard to deal with,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nAt the back of the folder, there was a list of all the rewards one could receive from various placements in the silkworm bouts. When Han Sen saw the reward for first place, his mouth gaped.\n\n\u201cWhat is a deified treasure set?\u201d Han Sen was confused, and so he continued reading. After reading it, he could only think, \u201cThe rich are stubborn.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cdeified treasure set\u201d was a set of armor composed of powerful treasures. The chest piece was a deified treasure. So was the belt. The gauntlets and the boots were four deified treasures. With the helmet, that made seven deified treasures. It combined to become a deified treasure set called the \u201cApollo Set.\u201d\n\nHan Sen continued to read. He noticed the Apollo Set wasn\u2019t just a deified treasure composed of seven pieces. Each piece was an individual deified treasure. They were all primitive class. If Han Sen used them all together, it would allow him to make use of special substance chains. That would put him at transmutation level.\n\nThe second-place contestant would receive one deified treasure. There were other resources that would be awarded as well, but none of them were deified. There was a wide gulf of prestige separating the rewards for second place and the rewards to be earned in first place.The folder included a photo of the Apollo Set. The entire thing shone silver like a polished mirror. It looked bad-*ss and mysterious. It seemed to radiate glory.\n\nHan Sen read the description of the Apollo Set, and after reading it, he felt himself starting to drool. If a user hadn\u2019t reached deified, they couldn\u2019t activate the Apollo Set\u2019s power. But if multiple people used the pieces of the set simultaneously, the seven-piece set could activate Apollo\u2019s Wings, which were the substance chains. They had primitive power, and a King could control them."
