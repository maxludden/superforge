    "text": "Guya looked at Buddha King. The clouds that trapped Buddha King rose up and drifted over to her.\n\n\u201cDid you take the leader?\u201d Guya asked Buddha King expressionlessly.\n\n\u201cAmitabha! I don\u2019t know what you mean!\u201d Buddha King said, after speaking out his buddha phrase.\n\nGuya looked at Buddha King and went on to say, \u201cI know how powerful the Kao are. Without support, they wouldn\u2019t have been brave enough to betray us in the manner that they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmitabha! What does that have to do with me?\u201d Buddha King said.\n\nYou think the Buddha Duke\u2019s meeting with the Kao leader slipped our notice?\u201d Guya looked angry, and she went on to say, \u201cIf the leader had simply listened to me, none of this would have happened. Tell me! Where did the leader go?\u201d\n\nNow Han Sen understood why they had not met a stronger Gana. At the auction, they had only seen Viscounts.\n\nThe Dukes had not appeared, and neither had the Earls. They had already been taken by Buddha King.\n\nBuddha King and the Kao had used the auction house as a distraction for the other races. While it played out, the more important Gana were successfully kidnapped. Buddha King and the Kao hadn\u2019t expected the Purgatory Heaven to come into play.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Buddha King\u2019s fault, of course. No one expected the Gana\u2019s deified item to have been in the Gana\u2019s hands. Or for it to have been inside a random statue.\n\n\u201cAmitabha! If you release me, I will keep you safe and bring you all together again.\u201d Buddha King admitted he had his hands on their leader, clearly planning to use this as leverage.\n\nAs soon as Buddha King said this, though, Guya drew a ghostly scimitar and swung it toward his neck.\n\nIn a split second, the King class elite was beheaded. His head rolled across the floor, with his eyes open. No one had expected Guya to simply cut his head off.\n\nThe other Kings were all in shock after what they had witnessed. Guya was a very decisive individual. In this heaven, a King class elite\u2019s life was as worthless and weak as the average commoner\u2019s. There was no need to pay them respect.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, but it made sense. Guya had already cast a spell to activate Purgatory Heaven, so yes, the fact she was a very decisive person was already established.\n\n\u201cSister! You killed Buddha King. What about our leader?\u201d Guna sounded worried.\n\nGuya coldly said, \u201cKilling him did not make a difference. Our leader isn\u2019t going to be returned, but don\u2019t worry; he\u2019s not going to die. He will likely be made a slave, for the Buddha won\u2019t kill him.\u201d\n\nThe other Kings did not speak, and Guya was correct. The Gana couldn\u2019t save anyone. If they had been reckless and left Purgatory Heaven, Buddha King would have found a chance. Instead of saving their kin, they\u2019d end up captured like the rest.\n\nEveryone knew this was a familial matter, but not everyone could make a decision like her.\n\nGuya killing Buddha King had put an end to his tricks and deception. It also counted as vengeance for her own people. When Guya looked at the clouds, she noticed that all the elites were in shock.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d Guya looked at Han Sen. She spoke one word, and Han Sen\u2019s cloud started flying towards her.\n\nEveryone was shocked. No one expected that the second guy she\u2019d kill to be Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? We have been through so much together. We didn\u2019t take your blood, and neither have we forced you to do anything against your will. Why don\u2019t you kill the guys who robbed you of your blood instead of Old Han, huh?\u201d Wang Yuhang said.\n\nGuya ignored him and looked at Han Sen. \u201cBut you did bully Guna, did you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me, then?\u201d Han Sen asked, sitting on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou did not harm Guna, and you did help us. I can give you one chance.\u201d Guya looked at Guna while speaking to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this chance?\u201d Han Sen did not believe she would let him go so easily.\n\n\u201cKill them, and you vdll be considered one of us.\u201d Guya pointed at Gold Jade King, Giant King, and the others.\n\nThe five Kings were sent forward, near Han Sen.\n\n\u201cGood idea! Killing this many elites will gain me so many enemies, and that\u2019s just what I need. Even a King of the Rebate? Not even Knife Queen would protect me for such a transgression! With this leverage, I could only work for you and no one else. If I don\u2019t do what you say, you can tell the others and make me one of the universe\u2019s Most Wanted,\u201d\n\nHan Sen said coldly.\n\n\u201cAre you going to kill them or not?\u201d Guya asked, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSure! Why not? They\u2019re not my family. There\u2019s no point giving up my own life for theirs.\u201d Han Sen just shrugged with his shoulders.\n\n\u201cGood. Use this to cut their heads off, and then you will be considered a friend.\u201d Guya gave the Ghost Scimitar to Han Sen.\n\nGiant King and Gold Jade King were surrounded by clouds. They could not move. They watched Han Sen approach, still holding his knife.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, do you really want to betray Knife Queen and the Rebate?\u201d Gold Jade King said icily.\n\n\u201cFrom what I recall, you never treated me as one of the Rebate, anyway. If you did, you would have taken me with you when you tried to escape. Now you think I\u2019m betraying you? Is this a joke or something?\u201d Han Sen slightly pressed the weapon against Gold Jade King\u2019s neck. The touch of the blade gave him a cold sweat.\n\nBut Han Sen did not cut him. He then brought the scimitar in front of Giant King and said, \u201cWhat did you say? You said if their blood was not enough, you\u2019d use ours. I should kill you for that, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cKill me if you want to. Just the crap and get on with it,\u201d Giant King said stolidly.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t strike. He walked past each elite, and eventually he turned back to Guya and said, \u201cThese are five King class elites. It would be a shame to kill them all. You should hold onto them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t kill them, I will kill you and your friends,\u201d Guya said dangerously.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we are dying.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cThat is not up to you to decide. I decide what happens here,\u201d Guya said.\n\nHan Sen threw the Ghost Scimitar back to Guya and said, \u201cFrom now on, I call the shots. You and Guna can be my secretaries. Treat this place nicely, and I will treat you nice in return.\u201d\n\nGuya, Guna, the Gana, and the Kings all looked at Han Sen like he was a madman."
