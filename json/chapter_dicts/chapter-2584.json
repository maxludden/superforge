Gu Qingcheng, Elysian Moon, Bao\u2019er, and the little red bird also came along. Fang Qing Yu decided to stay behind.\n\nThe further into the depths they went, the scarier the wind became. Whenever the wind blew, not even Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon could keep their balance. They didn\u2019t know why the wind was becoming so strong as they went deeper.\n\nFor there to be so much wind, there had to be a windy exit. But when he looked down, what was seen was a hellish crack. No air could escape.\n\nNing Yue was scared, but she was unaffected. The little green sword she wielded kept the scary wind from getting close to her.\n\n\u201cI wonder what that little green sword is? Its abilities are too scary,\u201d Han Sen said with a sigh.\n\nAs Han Sen was thinking, the white tiger suddenly disappeared. It was like it had just vanished into thin air.\n\n\u201cWhy has the white tiger disappeared?\u201d Ning Yue shouted in fear.\n\nBefore Han Sen could answer, the white tiger was there again. It rumbled at Han Sen, and while Han Sen was still reeling from the shock, it disappeared again.\n\nHan Sen and the others moved carefully forward and found a hole in the ground. It dropped almost straight down, which was why it looked like the white tiger had disappeared.\n\nDue to the angle, Han Sen hadn\u2019t noticed the hole until they were right on top of it.\n\nThey followed the white tiger down, and what they found at the bottom caught Han Sen by surprise.\n\nIt was a jar-shaped cave. They came in from the side, but there was no other exit. That place was a dead end.\n\nThe fact that the cave was a dead end wasn\u2019t what had caught their attention, though. There was something in the cave.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t recognize the device. Most of it was obscured by the stone that covered it, and only about one foot of it could be seen. The device was purple like copper, and there were some strange symbols carved across it. It looked like the handle of something, but it wasn\u2019t like the grip of a sword or a knife. That was because this handle was only as thick as a couple of Han Sen\u2019s fingers. And even with the little they could see right now, the group knew that it was too long to be a normal handle.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen and the others were still looking at that purple copper object that was buried by rocks when suddenly, a weird symbol shone with purple light. And right after, a scary storm came out of the purple object.\n\nEveryone was blown away by the wind. They bounced around the cave like rubber balls until the wind escaped through the passage they had used to enter. The respite afterward allowed them to get back on their feet.\n\nHan Sen and the little red bird had been left rather disheveled by the abrupt gust. The wind was far stronger than what they had experienced before.\n\nThe wind was comparatively gentle when it entered the tunnel, but inside that cave, they were exposed to the full power of the gusts.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? How can it be so powerful?\u201d Han Sen looked at the purple copper object with shock. His eyes were glowing.\n\n\u201cMeow.\u201d The white tiger had walked over to stand next to the purple copper object. It used a paw to point at the item, and then it called to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYou mean, you want me to get it out of there?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cMeow,\u201d the white tiger said with a nod.\n\nGu Qingcheng was staring intently at the purple copper object, and she made a guess. \u201cMaybe this thing can restrain the monster outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeow.\u201d The white tiger immediately nodded after hearing Gu Qingcheng speak.\n\n\u201cIs such a thing possible?\u201d Han Sen thought, suddenly excited by the prospect. He had been trying to think of a way they could deal with the monster on the island, but he hadn\u2019t yet come up with anything. If this weapon could be used against their enemies, then their crisis would be resolved. And Han Sen would receive another treasure, to boot. This was good.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything, and he went straight up to the purple copper object. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it.\n\nThe Purple-Eye Butterfly spun around in Han Sen\u2019s eye like four cherry blossoms. Within Han Sen\u2019s vision, the history of the purple copper object began to play back like a movie.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. While the Purple-Eye Butterfly was rewinding, he was able to see what it was. It was a purple copper jian swordbreaker.\n\nThe jian was a very rare weapon. It looked like a sword, but the blade was square. Rather than having a typical blade, which focused on sharpness, this weapon was all about strength.\n\nOrdinary jians were used in pairs, so a single jian was rare.\n\nThere was only one weapon here, though. There might have been another one lying around somewhere, but if so, Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nFor some reason, the jian had been left behind in the black sea. Layers of sediment had accumulated from the black sea, slowly building up to form the island they were currently inside.\n\nBased on its depth, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the weapon had somehow drawn the sediment together to make this entire mushroom island.\n\nBut that jian\u2019s weird symbols kept releasing storms, so its handle was clear of any rock. Furthermore, it had carved out an entire cave. Based on how well it was hidden, Han Sen had no idea how the white tiger had found it.\n\nHan Sen then had a weird thought. \u201cThat means this island is a stone inside the Black Hole Spider\u2019s stomach. The spider should have expelled any substances it couldn\u2019t digest over the years. Instead, because of this purple copper jian, the substances have built up into a solid mass. After billions of years, this entire island has been created.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me try it,\u201d Elysian Moon said. As Han Sen watched, Elysian Moon walked over to the purple copper jian. She cast a power and wrapped her hands around the exposed portion.\n\nPang!\n\nBefore Elysian Moon applied any strength to her grip, a frightening gale of wind blasted her body away at lightning speed. Han Sen and the others didn\u2019t fare much better.\n\nThey did not know what the purple copper jian was, but the fact that it could release such power when no one was even using it was amazing. Not even the little red bird could withstand the wind it summoned. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary item, that was for sure.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a deified weapon with a wind element. Is there anyone who is a master of the element of wind?\u201d Gu Qingcheng said.\n\nEveryone swapped glances with each other. No one there really focused on wind.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep trying. Maybe we don\u2019t have to be too attuned with the wind element. If we can\u2019t pull it out, we can remove the rocks that are surrounding it,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nElysian Moon nodded and drew her paper umbrella. She used it as a sword and slashed at the rocks atop the purple copper jian. The tip of the umbrella unleashed a raging swordlight that slammed into the rock.\n\nThat strike was strong enough to cut a hole through an entire planet, but when the light faded, the rocks weren\u2019t even scratched. Everyone stared at the undamaged rocks with slack jaws."
