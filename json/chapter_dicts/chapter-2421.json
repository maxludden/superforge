    "text": "Han Sen felt a chill. This was no longer funny.\n\nNing Yue\u2019s mental endurance was almost as good as Han Sen\u2019s, but Ning Yue had been dramatically affected by the green sword. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what to do with the changes that were occurring.\n\nNing\u2019s Yue body, his genes, and even his personality had undergone a shift.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t believe that Ning Yue now dressed entirely in pink and his personality had suddenly become so very sensitive. He was very cowardly now, and he had lost all of his decisiveness. He didn\u2019t look like Ning Yue anymore.\n\nHan Sen even wondered if Ning Yue\u2019s soul had been taken by a woman.\n\n\u201cWhat is up with this xenogeneic space? Why are there so many weird things going on?\u201d Han Sen frowned, and he subconsciously stepped farther away from the stone. He did not want to end up like Ning Yue.\n\nThe excavation of the stone fields continued. It took another seven or eight days for something strange to happen again. Someone managed to dig up a big rock that was leaking blood and had a hand coming out of it. The hand managed to break free and kill a dozen workers. It didn\u2019t stop until Night Wind appeared and killed it.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s experiments were still going on, too. Four groups had been affected thus far. They had all leveled up once, but only by one level. They didn\u2019t level up after that, and no one else had leveled down, either.\n\nNow that Han Sen could confirm the effective radius of the stone, he could mark out a danger zone around the warehouse. But he didn\u2019t call the ten teams back in. They still remained in their places, continuing the test.\n\nFor now, no one could be sure if the stone might begin acting differently. Either way, the experiment wasn\u2019t going to stop.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t enter the warehouse to look at the rock, but it seemed like the stone was benefitting everyone who got close to it. But after the one anomaly of what happened to Red Cloud, Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to risk being careless.\n\nJust like usual, Han Sen called the ten teams over. After questioning them, he planned on going back to his room to eat with Bao\u2019er. But Falling Leaf informed Han Sen that Miss Mirror wanted to see him in her office.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror has something important enough to call me in now?\u201d From what Han Sen could tell, the digging job was being shoved forward as fast as possible. And they kept encountering problems. Miss Mirror had gone to the stone fields on her own, so if she had come back seeking Han Sen, he surmised something must have happened.\n\nHan Sen went to Miss Mirror\u2019s office as he was instructed to. He knocked and entered. When he saw Miss Mirror, his greeting died on his lips.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Miss Mirror had ended up like Red Cloud. She didn\u2019t have that scary, mysterious presence anymore. Her lifeforce was weak. She was like a King now, that was certain. She was no longer deified.\n\n\u201cYes, I have become King class.\u201d Miss Mirror looked calm, but Han Sen could still see the profound sadness behind her eyes.\n\nIt looked like downgrading from being a deified being had been quite the gut-punch for Miss Mirror. He respected the strength of her mind, but even a strong person like her would be shaken like this.\n\nHan Sen went silent. Then he looked at Miss Mirror and asked, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\n\nHe knew Miss Mirror wouldn\u2019t ask him to come and see her for no reason. There were also limits to what she would tell a fake prince like him.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s eyes were steady. \u201cReinforcements are on the way. It will take them two weeks to arrive, and we are losing control of what is happening here. It has escaped my grasp, and something even worse might soon occur.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face looked glum. For a strong woman like Miss Mirror to make such a confession meant that things were really bad. It was almost unimaginable. Things must have been far worse than Han Sen himself expected.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just stop digging for now and leave this place? We can wait for backup to get here,\u201d Han Sen suggested quietly.\n\nMiss Mirror shook her head. \u201cIt is too late. Before I left the stone field, we dug up another statue.\u201d\n\nHan Sen froze.\n\n\u201cA second statue like the one in the warehouse?\u201d He asked, staring at Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cIt was different. This time, it was a genuine statue. It has a thousand eyes and hands, and each eye has four pupils.\u201d When Miss Mirror spoke of it, her breathing quickened. Her emotions were clearly still unstable.\n\n\u201cBecause of that statue, you became King class?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMiss Mirror nodded, and then she shook her head. \u201cWithin half an hour after digging up the statue, I dropped from being deified. But Night Wind, who was inspecting the statue with me, was fine. The other workers were fine, too. So, I cannot confirm that I fell because of the statue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, we really should move. We should abandon these efforts, stop excavation, and get out of here,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nMiss Mirror shook her head. \u201cI told you, it is too late. Look at my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to your eyes?\u201d Han Sen demanded. When he looked closer into Miss Mirror\u2019s eyes, what he saw shocked him.\n\nMiss Mirror once had beautiful eyes that looked like phoenixes. Her pupils had been black, but now they were red. And furthermore, the pupils were split in half. The four red pupils were a deeply unsettling sight.\n\n\u201cAre those pupils similar to the statue\u2019s?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMiss Mirror nodded. \u201cEveryone who saw the creature, including me and Night Wind, look like this. If we stray too far from the statue, we\u2019ll act like addicts who need a fix. The further away from the statue we go, the stronger the feeling grows. Our desire to dig in the stone fields becomes irresistible. You have to keep digging to scratch that itch. The only way to satisfy the urge is to plow. It is the only thing that makes us feel better.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face looked gloomy. Everything about this place was way too scary. Even deifieds were affected without knowing how or why. Han Sen couldn\u2019t ensure his own safety in that place.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Han Sen asked again. The situation was beyond everyone\u2019s control. He wasn\u2019t sure that he could be of any help.\n\nIf he could have chosen, he would have left the xenogeneic space. The further away he got, the better.\n\nMiss Mirror started to answer, but suddenly, the office\u2019s doors were banged open. Night Wind rushed in.\n\nHan Sen looked at Night Wind\u2019s eyes. His pupils had turned red, and he too had a case of the double-trouble pupils.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Miss Mirror asked, looking at Night Wind.\n\n\u201cWe unearthed stone doors in the stone field. They\u2019re huge, as if they lead to some giant, ancient city,\u201d Night Wind explained in a strained voice."
