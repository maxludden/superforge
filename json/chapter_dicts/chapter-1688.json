    "text": "Han Sen and Old Cat looked inside the metal box. There was a bright light inside, seething like boiling water. But it didn\u2019t spill.\n\nKatcha noises were coming from the light, and the noises made them both shiver with a chill.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what is that noise?\u201d Han Sen looked at the light in the metal box, but he couldn\u2019t see or feel anything.\n\n\u201cHow am I supposed to know? It sounds like teeth, munching on bones,\u201d Old Cat said, peering at the box.\n\n\u201cMunching bones? Be honest with me know: is this really some sort of greenhouse?\u201d Han Sen hadn\u2019t believed Nine-Life Cat when he was told it was a greenhouse.\n\nOld Cat decided to make a promise, and he said, \u201cIt is a greenhouse! I would not lie to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why does this look like a coffin? You say you hear some bone-breaking noises, so if this garden had bones\u2026 why would that make any sense?\u201d Han Sen looked at Old Cat.\n\nOld Cat felt guilty, and mumbled, \u201cThis is a greenhouse! It\u2019s just not a normal greenhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? What is not normal about it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nOld Cat knew if he didn\u2019t explain a little, Han Sen would just go on and on about this. So, he said, \u201cI researched it for a while. If I am correct, this is a royal greenhouse belonging to the crystallizers.\u201d\n\n\u201cA royal greenhouse?\u201d Han Sen thought Old Cat was lying. Greenhouses grew vegetables; they didn\u2019t grow meat, and certainly not bones.\n\nOld Cat looked serious and said, \u201cDo not underestimate the greenhouses of the crystallizers. The stuff they grow is not limited to carrots and other vegetables.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds as if you know what to expect.\u201d Han Sen stared down at Old Cat with hostility.\n\nOld Cat coughed and said, \u201cI only know a bit. This metal box is a crystallizer\u2019s growing box. A new type of plant is inside it.\u201d \u201cWhat is different about their plants?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have seen the plants of crystallizers before, and they look very weird. They shouldn\u2019t even be called plants, really. They have a lifeforce,\u201d Old Cat said.\n\n\u201cA plant with a lifeforce is nothing rare. There are loads of geno plants across the sanctuary,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nOld Cat suddenly said, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m trying to tell you. The sanctuary does not have geno plants. Crystallizers planted their seeds across the sanctuaries, and that is why they possess a lifeforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying a geno plant\u2019s alpha is inside there?\u201d Han Sen asked as he looked at the box with shock.\n\nThe metal box continued to create creepy katcha noises.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but if it has been created by a royal garden, it should be something good.\u201d Old Cat stopped for a moment and then continued. \u201cCrystallizers never planned to create new creatures or beast souls. What they wanted to grow was geno armor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can grow geno armor?\u201d Han Sen was shocked hearing this.\n\n\u201cNot originally. Crystallizers tried combining the genes of creatures, spirits, and their geno plants. But something big happened. The crystallizers lost, and the leftovers were attacked. The unfinished seeds can be found across the sanctuaries, having become geno plants,\u201d Old Cat explained.\n\nHan Sen looked at Old Cat and said, \u201cIf you can find this place and dig up this box, you must have a greater idea of what exactly is inside.\u201d\n\nOld Cat looked awkward and smiled. \u201cActually, I really don\u2019t know. I came because of my sound judgment. This could have been a royal greenhouse. It is possibly a location for geno armor, and that is why I selected this place. It was the best spot, and many important things are around. That\u2019s why I chose this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know Feng Shui?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe Old Cat at all. And he looked at the cat as if he was a liar.\n\nOld Cat shrugged and said, \u201cFine. I admit I picked the place because of the fertilizer, but that\u2019s important. I have dug through three other places nearby and found nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat fertilizer?\u201d Han Sen looked at the deep hole he had dug, and there was nothing there.\n\n\u201cDo you see how dark the soil in this place is? Look at the tablet. Do you see the red signs?\u201d Old Cat pointed at the tip of the metal box.\n\nHan Sen took a look, and it was exactly as the cat had been saying.\n\n\u201cDid you really think this was a gravestone? This is a piece of crystallizer gear from the greenhouse. The fertilizer was injected through the tablet Look at the tablet The item inside the box is being taken care of. This might be a very important item for the royal greenhouse.\u201d Old Cat looked at the box with shiny eyes.\n\n\u201cCan you take it out, then?\u201d Han Sen lifted his lips.\n\n\u201cCrystallizers items are tricky. You should be careful.\u201d Old Cat ignored Han Sen\u2019s suggestion. He kept on looking, but he did not move.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t appear, how would you have gotten the thing out by yourself? You can\u2019t just watch all the time,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nOld Cat wanted to say something, but they suddenly heard a slamming sound from inside the box.\n\nA hand reached through one of the broken sections of the box. It looked like jade but it wasn\u2019t; it looked like bone, but it wasn\u2019t. It gripped the box like a demon\u2019s hand.\n\nHan Sen and the Old Cat jumped away together, moving quite the distance."
