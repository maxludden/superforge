    "text": "Han Sen had planned to spend more time observing Gru\u2019s sword skills, but now he had to fight.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fingers twitched, and Spell\u2019s twin pistols roared madly, rapidly spitting out bullets.\n\nThe steel greatsword in Gru\u2019s hands flashed like the wind, cutting each bullet in half. Not a single bullet could escape the wondrous sword lights.\n\nA heavy steel greatsword spun around Gru like a bolt of pure lightning.\n\n\u201cThose are some good sword skills,\u201d Han Sen complimented his opponent.\n\nGru\u2019s skills were inferior to Lone Bamboo\u2019s talents, but Han Sen appreciated the fact that these techniques were incredibly stable. Every movement was rigorously practiced and could be used with a solid stance. The man was unleashing the max potential of his skills.\n\nThis was the way one should always practice their sword skills. It was a way to beat someone stronger when you were weaker, or take on an opponent who had the high ground. These were the strategies that weaker people should always employ. Being solid and using real strength to crush enemies, disabling opponents to deny them the chance to fight back\u2026 That was the real way to use a sword.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t good sword skills,\u201d Gru said. \u201cI began practicing with a blade when I was five years old. When I reached thirty, my sword skills still weren\u2019t very good. People always thought I was dumb and unsuitable for swordcraft. But I have a sword king body. It would be wasted if I didn\u2019t practice with a sword. And so, I kept on training. It has now been 46 years, and my sword skills still aren\u2019t good. All I know is that I am better than my ancestors. But still, that doesn\u2019t make me good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are using what you have learned, believe me when I tell you that you are already quite good. Not many people can perform this well.\u201d Han Sen knew that using a sword skill to its max potential was a harder feat than making a brand-new sword skill.\n\nNew sword skills could sometimes be created in moments of inspiration, but making perfect use of an existing sword skill\u2014regardless of the environment\u2014would take countless hours of practice and training. It required a lot of effort.\n\nAs the two of them spoke, their hands never stopped moving. Swords flashes and gunfire rang out. They kept collided against each other time after time, with Han Sen\u2019s bullets falling and Gru\u2019s sword lights unable to touch his opponent.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe this Gru is so good. His sword skills are excellent. Even amongst the Very High, these sword skills have to be amongst the best.\u201d Li Xue Cheng chuckled.\n\n\u201cGru was a late bloomer,\u201d Liyu Zhen said, nodding. \u201cEven though he doesn\u2019t have the speed of Pegasus, he is so stable that it\u2019s like he has weathered all the dangers of the world. If his opponent isn\u2019t considerably stronger than him, there is no way to break his sword. If the Extreme King used him as a guard, their bases would be as strong as stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky for us that Han Sen ran into Gru first. With Gru\u2019s stability, he should be able to squeeze Han Sen out of every ounce of his power. Even if Gru loses, other silkworms will know what to expect from Han Sen. They\u2019ll know his powers, and he\u2019ll be worn out.\u201d Li Xue Cheng felt at ease now.\n\nSome distance away stood a man with the head of a lion and the body of a human. He was staring at Han Sen and Gru as they conducted their battle.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Han Sen isn\u2019t as talented as the legends proclaim. Without treasure, that guy is pretty much worthless.\u201d A Fox woman laughed as she walked up next to Shale.\n\nShale looked serious as he said, \u201cGru\u2019s sword skill is King Path Sword, yet Han Sen is fighting him without exposing his moves. That alone proves how strong he is. Even my ninth-tier King body might expose my movements to the half-deified Gru.\u201d\n\nThe Fox woman laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve only fallen to King class. Did your balls shrink, as well? Where did the fearless Shale go, hmm? Have you seen him? Even Han Sen, who is just a ninth-tier King, can make you react this seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cI embody the destiny of the lionheart. I do everything I can with the utmost precision and care. I might lose, but I will not fail due to my own negligence,\u201d Shale said in a hard voice.\n\nThe Fox woman rolled her eyes. She looked at Shale and said, \u201cAnyway, what do you make of Han Sen\u2019s power? Can he defeat Gru?\u201d\n\n\u201cGru is strong, but Han Sen can beat him,\u201d Shale answered.\n\n\u201cIf Gru is strong, why would Han Sen win?\u201d Fox woman asked, looking interested.\n\n\u201cHe might win or he might lose.\u201d Shale spoke those six words and stopped talking.\n\n\u201cWhat about you? Which of you is stronger? You or Han Sen?\u201d The Fox woman looked at Shale, trying to see through his thoughts.\n\nShale didn\u2019t move. \u201cWe have never fought before. So, who can tell what will happen?\u201d\n\nOn the battlefield, Han Sen and Gru had performed a thousand moves against each other. But still, Han Sen had yet to find a way to beat Gru.\n\nHan Sen had to admit that Gru was too stable for him. Han Sen started to think that if he kept fighting like this, he would die of old age before he found the man\u2019s flaws. It seemed impossible to beat Gru through skill.\n\n\u201cIf agility doesn\u2019t seem to work against him, then it looks like I\u2019ll have to approach this more directly.\u201d Han Sen teleported away, establishing some distance between him and Gru.\n\n\u201cGru, I really admire your sword skills. But we have to determine a winner between us. Therefore, I am sorry.\u201d Han Sen lifted Spell\u2019s guns and took aim at Gru.\n\n\u201cUse all the moves you are able to.\u201d Gru gripped his steel greatsword tightly. His face looked placid. It was as if even the sky breaking or the earth shattering would not move him.\n\nHan Sen and the Extreme King were enemies, but Han Sen still admired his foe. Gru was a strong character, and if he became a leader among the Extreme King, their race would gain a great deal.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame. The Extreme King are controlled by King Bai. Gru will have no chance,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He aimed Spell at Gru and pulled the trigger.\n\nPang!\n\nA bullet tore out of the gun with a shriek that sounded like space itself beginning to tear. The bullet was headed straight for Gru, and Gru was frozen. He had held the sword with one hand previously, but now he carefully gripped it with two. He shouted and brought the steel greatsword above his head to swing it down on the bullet.\n\nA sword light glared with blinding intensity as it hit the bullet. The sword strike found its target, but the bullet didn\u2019t split in half. Instead, it exploded.\n\nBoom!\n\nIt was like a hydrogen bomb detonating. Looking at it was like staring straight into the sun. It covered Gru and most of the land.\n\nWhen the explosion finally faded, a huge hole had been torn into the mountain. Gru was lying in the crater, soaked in blood. His limbs were all gone, and wounds covered every inch of his body that remained.\n\n\u201cWhat frightening power.\u201d The audience was shocked. A ninth-tier King had used his pure power to defeat the half-deified Gru. That was astonishing."
