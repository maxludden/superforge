    "text": "Han Sen thought, \u201cThere are so many princes and princesses that are deified now. How many resources has this cost them? Have the resources of the Extreme King all been depleted now?\u201d\n\nAfter reading it all, he made a mental record of all the princes and princesses he would be accompanying. Bai King made it sound like it was supposed to be a casual affair. If the princes and princesses ended up dead, there was no doubt Bai King would be very angry. It was not likely that Han Sen\u2019s time in the Extreme King would be as joyful as it had been.\n\nHan Sen did not want to leave the Extreme King just yet, so he planned on finishing this task. Plus, he was a bit interested in learning more about the Starter King\u2019s Land.\n\nBai King had only told him where the place was, but he never said what sort of place it was. He had not described what it looked like.\n\nWhen Han Sen returned to the garden. Bao Ying was waiting for him. Han Sen told her he was going to the Starter King\u2019s Land. That way, she would not have to go to the garden again.\n\nHearing that Han Sen was going to the Starter King\u2019s Land, Bao Ying appeared to be in a state of disbelief.\n\n\u201cIs there a problem with going to Starter King\u2019s Land?\u201d Han Sen wondered. He looked at Bao Ying.\n\nBao Ying shook her head. \u201cThe king must really love you a lot. In the past, only princes and princesses could enter Starter King\u2019s Land. I would never have expected the king to give you permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know what kind of place Starter King\u2019s Land is?\u201d Han Sen wanted to find out more about Starter King\u2019s Land.\n\nBao Ying shook her head. \u201cOnly princes and princesses can enter. Whatever happens in Starter King\u2019s Land is never spoken upon when they return. I do not know much. I only know that Starter King\u2019s Land is a secret place left by the Alpha King. That place was for testing the mettle of the princes and princesses. It was for choosing the one who would rightfully ascend the throne. Normally, the better they performed in Starter King\u2019s Land, the higher the chance they could get the throne. But you are not of the king\u2019s bloodline. I suppose, no matter how well you perform, you won\u2019t get anything out of it.\u201d\n\nBao Ying seemed to be trying to remind Han Sen not to offend the princes and princesses.\n\n\u201cThis will be interesting.\u201d Han Sen stroked his jaw and thought, \u201cWhy would Bai King let me go to a place like this? Is there some conspiracy at play? Is something going on behind the scenes?\u201d\n\nNo matter what the case might have been, Han Sen still had to go there. He was definitely more curious about Starter King\u2019s Land.\n\nThe Extreme King\u2019s Alpha King was Sacred Leader\u2019s servant. What he left behind might have been something truly special.\n\nIt was time for the rendezvous. When Han Sen was at the entrance of the Starter King\u2019s Land, the princes and princesses were already gathered. They saw Han Sen arrive. When they did, they looked confused.\n\n\u201cGood. Everybody is here,\u201d Bai Buyi said. \u201cThe Starter King\u2019s Land is about to open. You guys must remember that Starter King\u2019s Land is very dangerous. Every time a group ventures in, princes and princesses tend to die. Starter King\u2019s Land only opens once in a while and with a very short window. It will close very soon. You will have to wait a month before you can access it again. In that time, not even a true god elite can enter. So, you guys must be very careful and help each other. If you do not co-operate, it is unlikely anyone else can save you.\u201d\n\nPrince Swordstar coldly looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cSecond Uncle, Holy Baby is not from father\u2019s bloodline. Why is he allowed permission to enter Starter King\u2019s Land?\u201d\n\nEvery prince and princess turned to look at Han Sen. They were like Prince Swordstar. They thought letting an outsider xenogeneic student into Starter King\u2019s Land was a ludicrous prospect.\n\n\u201cThis is a decree by the king,\u201d Bai Buyi coldly said. \u201cIf you have any questions, you can go and take them up with the king.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing what was said, Prince Swordstar did not speak again. He just angrily stared at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen shrugged his shoulders and did not say anything. He was only in charge of keeping the sons and daughters alive. Han Sen would not care if they got injured. If they were stupid enough to fight him, he did not mind that either. As long as he battered them around and did not kill them, all would be fine.\n\nOf course, Han Sen was still in charge of recording their performance in Starter King\u2019s Land. Although he did not plan on doing anything on the record, if they were really going to be mean, he did not mind describing how dumb and pathetic they were. It could heavily affect Bai King\u2019s ultimate decision.\n\nMost princes and princesses were similar to Prince Swordstar, but they were even eviler. They did not show their distaste for Han Sen\u2019s company like Prince Swordstar did though.\n\n\u201cYour time is up! Please, everyone\u2026 Please go to the Starter King\u2019s Land now,\u201d Bai Buyi said. He walked in front of the palace and opened the palace\u2019s door.\n\nThe princes and princesses looked inside the palace. They had only heard about Starter King\u2019s Land before, but they had never entered it. They were curious.\n\nInside the palace, Han Sen many familiar pieces of equipment.\n\n\u201cThese\u2026 They cannot be crystallizer machinery.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He stared into the palace and saw countless machines built from crystal. They were all shining and strangely glistening. It looked like the crystallizer control room Han Sen once visited.\n\nBai Buyi brought the group of prince and princesses into the palace. He pointed at a glass container that looked like a machine and said, \u201cYou guys stand in there.\u201d\n\nA bunch of prince and princesses walked into the crystal container. That crystal container was 60 feet long, so 20 prince and princesses were able to stand inside without feeling too cramped.\n\nHan Sen had been looking at the machines that looked like crystallizer machinery. He thought, \u201cAre these crystallizer items the Extreme King Alpha used to have? Did these machines belong to Sacred?\u201d\n\nWhile Han Sen was thinking, Bai Buyi stood before a crystal wall that looked like a control room. His finger moved quickly across the crystal wall. Each time he touched the crystal well, there was a flash on it.\n\nAs Bai Buyi pointed at it, Han Sen noticed the crystal container was starting to spin. The bottom was spinning in a different direction to the crystal ball. This kind of program made Han Sen think about the teleportation machines featured in the Alliance.\n\nThe Alliance\u2019s teleportation machines were not pure crystallizer tech. There were a lot of restrictions, and they certainly couldn\u2019t teleport that many people at once.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Han Sen was very curious. He wanted to know what the place called Starter King\u2019s Land was.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen felt a surge of magic go through his eyes. It was the same feeling he had when using the teleporters in the Alliance. When his vision stopped spinning, he noticed he was not inside the crystal container anymore."
