    "text": "\u201cBlasphemy to a God Spirit should result in death.\u201d Moment God coldly looked at Han Sen. The needles in his right eye were turning quickly. It was different from the ones in his left eye. The needles in his right eye were going counterclockwise.\n\nAs the needles of his right eye spun, in other people\u2019s eyes, Han Sen\u2019s movements seemed to be slower. It looked like he was moving in slow motion.\n\nMoment God\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t slowing down. He was very fast. One was fast, and the other was slow. It created a clear contrast. Moment God teleported in front of Han Sen. His fingers were very sharp. He was scratching toward Han Sen\u2019s face. The fingernails were like the tips of a lance. They were going to pierce Han Sen\u2019s eyes.\n\nMoment God\u2019s face looked very interested as he laughed in an evil way. He slashed downward, but Han Sen\u2019s body disappeared in front of him.\n\nIn the next moment, Han Sen\u2019s body appeared near Moment God\u2019s back. The Sky Vine Radish God Lance was thrusting into his opponent\u2019s neck. The tip of the lance was right next to him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very powerful teleport skill, but it is futile against me.\u201d The needles in Moment God\u2019s eyes kept spinning in different directions. Han Sen\u2019s speed was constantly slowing down while his opponent\u2019s speed grew faster. The tip of the lance almost touched his skin.\n\nMoment God established some distance between them. He turned around and threw a punch into Han Sen\u2019s belly. Han Sen was like an old man with slow reactions. He saw Moment God\u2019s punch, but he could do nothing to dodge. It was also too late for him to put the lance away.\n\nMoment God\u2019s fist was still too slow. Han Sen\u2019s body teleported to the other end of the Moment God Temple plaza.\n\nThe man and the god kept fighting. Moment God\u2019s power, which could control time, was incredibly weird. Han Sen\u2019s ability to teleport was shocking too. Neither of them was able to do anything to each other.\n\n\u201cDollar is so strong. He can fight a Disaster God Spirit without reprieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe keeps using teleportation skills to move around.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Moment God has to be a time element God Spirit. He has the power to make Dollar slow down in a web of time. That does not only make him slow down, but his powers and mind also slow down. If it was a normal person in this situation, even if he had a teleportation skill, it would be too late to use them. He would instantly be killed by Moment God. Dollar\u2019s thoughts traveled 10,000 miles per hour. They are not restricted by the time god\u2019s power. In the universe, not many people can practice teleportation skills to this level. It is almost as good as the Very High with their God\u2019s Wander ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how powerful his teleportation skills are, he cannot defeat Moment God.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had his time area to use, but it was his other persona that was making use of it. He was not able to use it as he was now.\n\nPlus, a time ghost beast soul\u2019s time area was weaker than Moment God\u2019s time god power. Even if he used it, it would not make a change in the current fight. Using time power before time element God Spirits was like using a big knife against a Guan Yu. Han Sen did not plan on doing that.\n\nBecause Han Sen had the time area, he knew that breaking Moment God\u2019s time god area could only be accomplished through two different techniques. One required speed, and one required absolute power. Old Vulture used absolute speed to break Han Sen\u2019s time area.\n\nHan Sen did not have that kind of speed, so all he could do was use absolute power to break Moment God\u2019s god power.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter with time or space, but the rules of the universe are the rules of the universe. They are governed by the universal cogwheels. If I can control the cogwheels of the universe, I can prohibit the universal cogwheels from moving. Even god powers will be unable to affect the spread.\u201d Han Sen teleported to dodge Moment God\u2019s attack. He kept using the Dongxuan Sutra and pumped all the power into Dongxuan Aura that he could. He tried to use absolute power to control the spinning of the universal cogwheels.\n\n\u201cIn xenogeneic mode, my power is better than the average true god. I still do not know if it is enough to suppress a Disaster class God Spirit.\u201d Han Sen kept using the Dongxuan Aura to give pressure to the time universal cogwheel.\n\nThe time universal cogwheel could not be stopped completely, but the speed of its spin was slow. The effects on Han Sen weakened.\n\n\u201cThe xenogeneic power cannot suppress Disaster God Spirits.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nTime\u2019s delay had little effect on him now. Under the effect of the Dongxuan Aura, Moment God\u2019s own time boost was slowed down. It made his speed slow down. Adding this and taking away that, Han Sen turned active. He was not going to keep teleporting to fight Moment God.\n\nDong!\n\nThe Sky Vine Radish God Lance was able to hit Moment God\u2019s claws for the first time. The god power hit the lance\u2019s light. It triggered a scary explosion and shockwave. Han Sen flew away through space by a few thousand miles. Moment God\u2019s legs had two very deep footprints on the god temple plaza.\n\n\u201cHe can affect my time god power. It is no wonder he is so cocky. He dares to challenge me!\u201d Moment God\u2019s eyes flashed. The needles in his eyes kept spinning. They looked scary and weird. He said, \u201cIf you think this can fight a god, you are wrong. I will let you know the difference between a mere creature and a God Spirit.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Moment God\u2019s claws dug into his own eyes. There was one in the right and one in the left.\n\nKatcha!\n\nSeeing blood being spilled as the two sharp claws poked into his eyes, Moment God unplugged his eyeballs right out of their sockets.\n\nThis was different from what Han Sen was expecting. Inside the sockets, god lights flickered. The eyeballs, which had been dug out, were not the only ones. Many eyes started to come out. One by one, eyes rolled out of the god light socket.\n\nRoar!\n\nWhen Moment God madly roared, all the eyeballs in his eyes were dugout. There were 12 of them. He put his hands together. He made a bracelet out of the 12 eyeballs. They went across his crossed hands. There were still streams of blood coming out of his eyes.\n\nHan Sen looked at the eyeball bracelet. All those eyeballs were like circular watches. All of the needless were jumping to an unspecified rhythm, but all the eyeballs were pointing to a different point in time.\n\nHan Sen looked closer and discovered that each watch was one hour later than the others. \u201cTime is like a ruler. One mark is one scar. Stupid low-life creature, how dare you insult a God Spirit. Today, I will wipe you from the annals of history. I will let all the cheap creatures know that they cannot offend a God Spirit.\u201d Moment God\u2019s hands were holding the bloody eyeball necklace. His eyes were still bleeding god blood as he spoke his words of madness.\n\nAfter Moment God crazily spoke, his fingers flicked the eyeballs. The necklace was instantly brighter. It covered the entirety of space."
