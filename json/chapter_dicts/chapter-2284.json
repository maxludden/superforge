    "text": "Han Sen looked at Yisha. They were confused. What was this thing? It was sort of like a treasure, but it wasn\u2019t a treasure. It was sort of like a creature, but it wasn\u2019t a creature.\n\nThe Jade Drum was a creature, but the Jade Drum was created naturally. It wasn\u2019t something that was man-made. Words were scrawled across the little bell\u2019s body, though, and that suggested it wasn\u2019t a natural being.\n\n\u201cOkay, Big King. Why did you snatch us and bring us here?\u201d Han Sen asked the bell.\n\nBig King Bell rolled its eyes and jumped. He said, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018snatch\u2019? I was saving you guys. Couldn\u2019t you tell? Don\u2019t talk big if you don\u2019t know sh*t, kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were saving us? How?\u201d Han Sen looked at Big King Bell with confusion.\n\n\u201cUgh, you guys don\u2019t understand anything! And yet here you come, waltzing into the Holy Spirit Sea. You must have a death wish. If it wasn\u2019t for me saving you guys, you two would have ended up like him. You know, with only bones left.\u201d The bell jumped up to land atop the skeleton\u2019s skull as it spoke.\n\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\nHe had originally thought that the skeleton was Big King Bell\u2019s master, but now, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\n\u201cHa! This piece of garbage? How do you expect me to remember who he was? He was just another pawn, like a background extra in this tale.\u201d Big King Bell proclaimed, lifting his lips in disdain.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe the bell. There was no way that an unimportant person would have been in charge of controlling a technological marvel like the white whale. Even if the man hadn\u2019t been very powerful personally, he could have used the whale to hold his own against a deified being.\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d Yisha asked Big King Bell.\n\nBig King Bell rolled its eyes. \u201cHe thought that since he had this strange machine, he could cross the Holy Spirit Sea and take the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure. He had no idea of the power of the Holy Spirit Sea. This thing didn\u2019t stand a chance of repelling the sea\u2019s power. Not in the least. He died before he even made it to Holy Spirit Town. Only his bones remained.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Big King Bell jumped onto the control platform and cockily said, \u201cBut this thing was quite interesting, and so I decided to hold onto it as a keepsake.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew Big King Bell was talking about the white whale. He looked at the skeleton and told Yisha, \u201cThis guy must have dived a long time ago. He didn\u2019t get here recently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Another creature was here?\u201d Big King Bell asked before Yisha could respond. He seemed startled as he stared at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a few of them.\u201d Han Sen looked at Big King Bell and asked, \u201cYou came here, too. What is so strange about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, I was here\u2026\u201d Big King Bell trailed off as a thought crossed his mind. He stopped talking.\n\n\u201cHere what?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Big King Bell grunted and said, \u201cThat is none of your business. Don\u2019t you have the relic with you? How were so many other creatures able to reach this place? Or is Under Overbearing now so old that people are reaching the palace through his mouth?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked that Big King Bell knew he possessed the relic. This bell seemed to know things that it shouldn\u2019t, so perhaps it was connected to the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure somehow.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste our breath. Give me the relic, and when I open the holy town\u2019s treasury, you will receive what you are owed.\u201d Big King Bell hovered in the air before Han Sen as it spoke.\n\n\u201cYou can have the relic, but I will have to see if you have what it takes.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cI was born deified. I have beaten billions of people in this universe. I am the strongest in the sky or on the land. Even the Sacred Leader, when he met with me, would refer to me as Big King Brother. Are you honestly trying to compete with me?\u201d Big King Bell looked at Han Sen with actual surprise. He hadn\u2019t expected Han Sen to be so ignorant.\n\n\u201cBig King Brother, even if you are so strong, you should demonstrate that strength. Otherwise, how am I honestly supposed to believe that you are as strong as you claim?\u201d Han Sen put out his hands as he spoke.\n\n\u201cI pulled you guys in here on a whim. Wasn\u2019t that enough? Do I have to kill you idiots to show you how strong I am?\u201d Big King Bell looked at Han Sen coldly as he slowly rose higher into the air. He looked as if he was going to kill Han Sen.\n\n\u201cBig King Brother, it was a powerful demonstration when you grabbed us. But that isn\u2019t enough to make us want to hand over the relic. Will you show me again? If you can convince us, I will give you the relic without argument.\u201d Han Sen smiled at Big King Bell.\n\nHe thought that the Big King Bell was quite interesting, and that was an impetus for Han Sen to trash talk it.\n\nThe bronze bell had shielded them as it pulled them inside. But that was because they hadn\u2019t been prepared for its sudden arrival. Yisha still hadn\u2019t shown off her true strength, so Han Sen wasn\u2019t worried about annoying the bell.\n\nBig King Brother looked down on Han Sen with utter disdain. \u201cEven a small fraction of my power would convince you to obey me, but I have way too many powerful geno arts. Let me think of a weaker one I can show you. Just in case my geno art is too strong, and I accidentally end up killing you all.\u201d\n\nBig King Bell spun in the air twice, looking as if he had made a decision. He jumped onto the control platform and punched a few buttons. The white whale then rose to the surface and opened its mouth. The front of the control room looked out through the white whale\u2019s eyes, letting the operator see what was going on outside.\n\n\u201cIdiots! I am going to open your eyes to my power. I am going to show you the techniques of a real and invincible elite,\u201d Big King Bell said. His body began to glow green and spin as it grew bigger and bigger.\n\nThe bell turned onto its side, aiming its opening out the white whale\u2019s mouth. Then, they heard a loud chiming noise from the bell. A scary shockwave blasted out of the bell.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe whole sea was cut in half by the bell\u2019s sonic blast. The waters were parted down to the seafloor and all the way to the opposite shore of the ocean.\n\n\u201cOh, d*mn! This guy really does have a lot of power.\u201d Han Sen was frozen. Big King Bell\u2019s power really did seem to exceed that of Yisha and Fox Queen.\n\nYisha looked shaken, too. The power that Big King Bell released was truly magnificent.\n\nHoly Spirit Sea wasn\u2019t just a vat of ordinary seawater, either. Yisha didn\u2019t think she could split that much of it.\n\n\u201cSo, how about that? Do you guys believe me now? Give me the relic at once! Follow me, before I decide that I don\u2019t like you. If you do come, you guys will benefit greatly,\u201d Big King Bell said to Han Sen with a lot of pride.\n\nWhile they were talking, three shadows appeared above the sea. It was Fox Queen, Mister White, and Crime.\n\nWhen Fox Queen saw the big white whale, she shook her fox tail. An invisible cord of power lashed around the white whale, and she lifted it out of the sea.\n\nBig King Bell quickly leaped atop the platform and hit the buttons on the panels. The white whale opened its mouth and created a black hole, then sent a force of suction towards Fox Queen.\n\nBut Fox Queen\u2019s hand tugged on the cord of power, binding the white whale\u2019s mouth. The white whale was unable to open its maw, and so the black hole died inside it.\n\nHan Sen was waiting to see how Big King Bell disposed of Fox Queen. If she was killed, they\u2019d lose a dangerous enemy.\n\nBut when Han Sen turned around, he saw Big King Bell pulling out a big bag seemingly out of nowhere. The bell was going to flee out of the whale via the backdoor.\n\n\u201cBig King Brother, aren\u2019t you going to kill her?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\n\u201cI am busy. I will let her live for now, but I will surely remember her. The next time I see her, I will blow some air at her to kill her,\u201d Big King Bell said firmly. Then he left through the backdoor with his big bag in tow.\n\nHan Sen and Yisha were frozen. They weren\u2019t sure about how to react."
