Night Empress was wrathful, and she gestured with her hands to blanket the helpless spirits and creatures with a scornful darkness.\n\nThey mustered every ounce of strength they had left in a bid to repel the malevolent dark, but it was a futile resistance. Their powers were consumed by the looming black, as if it fed on their offerings.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t long before the dark ravaged their bodies like a hungry beast before an open feast, in dire need of a feeding.\n\n\u201cPah, I see through your tricks!\u201d No God Emperor bellowed, thrusting forward towards Night Empress with his No God Sword.\n\nHis arrogance was blinding, and he did not believe demi-gods could return from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary and enter the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. He thought this was all a ruse, an illusion conjured by the trickster Lotus, or a doppelganger formed by some force through past memories and history.\n\nSeeing No God approach her, Night Empress was unconcerned. She was as real as the night, and as real as the darkness with which she swarmed the imperious emperor.\n\nThis had all transpired over the course of a few measly seconds, and then, as quick as it had begun, it ended. The darkness was removed from the area.\n\nHan Sen looked around, noticing all the creatures and spirits had disappeared with the violent black.\n\n\u201cWhere are they? Where did they go?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThey are dead,\u201d Night Empress said.\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cCan they respawn?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; such a killing is absolute,\u201d Night Empress answered, with perfect certainty.\n\nNight Empress then frowned, \u201cHmm, but that spirit stone can allow him a respawn. Not bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother, are you referring to No God Emperor?\u201d Lotus Empress asked.\n\nNight Empress nodded, then told her, \u201cMy time here is limited. Why don\u2019t you come with me to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary? I can guarantee your safety there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can come with you? As easily as that?\u201d Lotus Empress asked in wonder.\n\nNight Empress assured her, \u201cOf course, you should know that. Why else would you summon a demi-god? Why else would you summon me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t summon you.\u201d After Lotus Empress said this, she eyed Han Sen.\n\nNight Empress said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll bring him, too.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was quick to reject her offer. He told her, \u201cThanks, but no thanks. You should just take Miss Lotus with you.\u201d\n\nAs pleasant as his words were, beneath the surface, Han Sen was hissing a fire directed at Dragon King. His information had been incorrect once more.\n\nSummoning a demi-god was a shortcut into the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, and a method in which a being wishing to ascend could bypass The Ten Steps of the Holy Door and its cleansing flames.\n\nAs much as Han Sen appreciated the offer, he would prefer to walk the purifying steps. And that aside, he had yet to open his tenth gene locks.\n\nAnd furthermore, Han Sen knew he could just step into the Evolution Pool for a shortcut of his own.\n\n\u201cMother, I will take the steps as you did,\u201d Lotus Empress said.\n\nNight Empress ran her fingers through the hair of her daughter and smiled. She told her, \u201cIt is good that you wish to pass through the holy fire. Not only does it speak to your strength of heart and resolve, the benefits are tremendous.\u201d\n\nNight Empress then proceeded to summon something dark. She handed it to Lotus, telling her, \u201cI don\u2019t have much time. Take this. If No God Emperor returns for you, use it. Use it to destroy that monster.\u201d\n\nNight Empress then walked back to the altar and became a statue of stone.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t go yet! I was the one who summoned you, after all. Where\u2019s my gift?!\u201d Han Sen pleaded as she went, but she gave no heed. She was a statue before he finished, and he knew he wasn\u2019t going to receive a response.\n\nThe altar then disappeared in a final flash of darkness, and the next time Han Sen and Lotus Empress looked around, they were back nearby the Luminous Stone. The Luminous Stone was webbed with cracks, unlike before. And after an uneasy tremble, it shattered completely, collapsing into a mound on the ground.\n\nThe jue Han Sen possessed finally stopped vibrating incessantly.\n\nHan Sen was gutted, though. Despite his efforts to summon Night Empress, he hadn\u2019t received a single goodie.\n\n\u201cHaha!\u201d Lotus Empress was laughing, in a cheery mood Han Sen had not known she could display. She went ahead to comfort him, offering, \u201cHow about I give you a gift instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat gift would that be?\u201d Han Sen thought getting something off Lotus Empress wouldn\u2019t be half bad.\n\nBut then Han Sen\u2019s eyes drifted to the black jewel she had been gifted by her mother, Night Empress. A streak of envy crossed his mind, and he thought it\u2019d be great if he could have it.\n\nHan Sen knew she wouldn\u2019t be giving that to him, though.\n\nLotus Empress swung the jewelry in front of Han Sen and told him, \u201cIt\u2019s this Night Gem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re giving that to me?\u201d Han Sen was made exuberantly happy, but he was jumping to conclusions.\n\nLotus Empress pulled back her hands that caressed the lovely thing, saying, \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why swing it in front of me? Are you taunting me?\u201d Han Sen asked, with a dried attitude.\n\nLotus Empress was emitting a vibrant radiance, and she seemed to be genuinely happy after all that had happened. She said, \u201cYes, haha. But don\u2019t worry, I have something better for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can offer me something better?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think anything could beat a gift that was given by a demi-god.\n\n\u201cYeah, do you want it? Yes or no?\u201d Lotus Empress asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take anything you are willing to give me,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nSince Han Sen had already taken a bunch of Holy Baby fruit, he was down for something else off her. Besides, he was the one who summoned Night Empress. Han Sen thought he was due a reward for that deed, for sure.\n\nLotus Empress then walked around Han Sen in circles. He admired the delicate grace of her steps through an intense observation of her body. She was gorgeous.\n\nBefore Han Sen could figure out what she was doing, though, Lotus Empress told him, \u201cHow about me as your gift?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t believe the stunning offer he had just received.\n\n\u201cYes. I am your gift. Isn\u2019t that better than a measly Night Gem?\u201d Lotus Empress spoke with a seductive drawl to her words, in an attractive lure.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re right about that! You\u2019re much better than a silly jewel. Do you need to pack a bag, or are you already prepared to come with me?\u201d Han Sen looked at her with avaricious eyes."
