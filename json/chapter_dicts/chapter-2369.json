    "text": "Han Sen frowned, and Lilly looked upset. Then he realized something.\n\nHan Sen was riding atop the blood kirin, following slowly behind Lan Haixin. He behaved as if he didn\u2019t care, but the truth was, he didn\u2019t know where the relic was. He stayed carefully behind Lan Haixin where he wouldn\u2019t have to lead the party.\n\nWhat confused Han Sen was that the old female Siren in front wasn\u2019t guiding them away from Planet Water Zone. They were actually headed for the deeper recesses of the sea.\n\n\u201cDoes the Siren treasure reside here on the planet? If the treasure is here, why haven\u2019t they just gone and taken it already?\u201d Han Sen thought for a minute and suddenly realized, \u201cMaybe Lan Haixin and the others don\u2019t have possession of the relic? Maybe they didn\u2019t bring it with them; the relic might have already been on Planet Water Zone when they came here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought some more, and he considered many details. He thought to himself, \u201cIf that is what is happening, then Bai Yi\u2019s mother should have kept the relic. In that case, why didn\u2019t Bai Yi\u2019s mother give the relic to her son? Based on the angry journal entries on Bai Yi\u2019s computer, he had no idea where the relic was. But Lan Haixin did. This whole scenario makes no sense.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought some more, but he couldn\u2019t find a reasonable explanation for this. He eventually grew tired of the fruitless line of thought, so he decided to roll with things and see where his luck might take him. He would love to take the relic for himself, but it would be fine if he couldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t his, after all.\n\nFollowing the guidance of that old Siren woman, Han Sen and the others stopped near a mountain deep beneath the sea.\n\nHan Sen frowned and looked around.\n\nHe was very familiar with this underwater mountain. The last time he was here, he had been chasing the Move Mountain Sea Conch. In fact, this was where he killed both the Move Mountain Sea Conch and the Crystal God Conch.\n\nBut Han Sen had been on the left side of the mountain back then. Now, he was on the right side of the mountain.\n\n\u201cThe Crystal God Conch cannot be related to this relic, surely,\u201d Han Sen thought. He felt something very strange occurring.\n\nBai Yi had killed all of Planet Water Zone\u2019s high-class xenogeneics. This underwater mountain had two Kings and one deified. That was definitely strange.\n\n\u201cMy lady, it is okay.\u201d The old Siren woman walked before a cliff face and bowed to Lan Haixin.\n\nLan Haixin nodded and gave Bao\u2019er to the female Siren guard. Then she walked in front of the mountain and took the necklace off her neck.\n\nThe necklace was simple: a red chain adorned with a blue stone pendant. It wasn\u2019t shiny like a gem, so it didn\u2019t appear to be anything too special.\n\nIf Lan Haixin hadn\u2019t brought it out now, Han Sen would never have known that it was important. He would have walked right past it if it was lying on the side of the road. It was too ordinary-looking to even draw the eye.\n\nThere was a small triangular hole in the mountainside, and Lan Haixin slid the blue stone into it. The stone fit the small hole perfectly. Then, a booming noise came from within the mountain.\n\nThe whole underwater mountain moved, revealing a dark path beneath. Stairs led downwards, but when Han Sen tried to look down them, he could only see blackness.\n\nThe seawater had been separated by some hidden force, too. The path was dry.\n\nThe old Siren woman slowly headed down the stairwell, and Lan Haixin brought Bao\u2019er and the other Siren in with her.\n\nHan Sen frowned and followed after Lan Haixin. He looked around dubiously, feeling nervous about something unseen. He couldn\u2019t quite tell what was making him unsettled, though.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s instincts were reliable. Aside from his guesses about whether or not he would receive a beast soul, his other feelings were fairly accurate.\n\nIf Han Sen was feeling this unsettled, there had to be some danger lurking in that place.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t yet detect any presences that shouldn\u2019t have been there. The stairs led down and down, as if they would never end. The people shone like holy lights in the dark, but their lights only lit up a small portion of the area around them. And their lights didn\u2019t penetrate far below.\n\nHan Sen looked down the dark stairs, and he felt as if he was walking into the hellish maw of some terrible beast.\n\nLilly was scared, and she stood as close as she could to the blood kirin. She almost found herself hugging Han Sen\u2019s legs. She was usually scared of the blood kirin and stayed as far away from him as she could. Clearly, the darkness scared her far more. Her decision to stay that close to Han Sen and the blood kirin revealed how frightened she really was.\n\nIn other circumstances, Han Sen already would have comforted her. But he was disguised as Bai Yi. Bai Yi wasn\u2019t a man who showed compassion and concern for others, so he pretended as if there was nothing to see.\n\nThe group moved silently. Han Sen wasn\u2019t certain how long they\u2019d been traveling, but he figured it was at least eight hours before they saw a light up ahead in the darkness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d The old Siren woman looked happy, and she moved a little faster.\n\nThe light grew brighter. After walking for another half hour, Han Sen saw what was basking in the light. And what he saw shocked him.\n\nIt was a crystal palace that looked like it had come straight out of a legend. The whole palace was bathed in holy light and mysterious clouds. It looked like something out of a dream.\n\nWhen Han Sen and the others drew closer, they saw that the crystal palace\u2019s gate had a sign above it. It really did say Crystal Palace.\n\nLooking at the Crystal Palace, Han Sen felt rather nervous. His heart jumped.\n\nThe Crystal Palace was entirely transparent, as if it had been crafted from flawless crystals. He should have been able to see straight through it, but clouds and strange sparkles of rainbow light hung within the Crystal Palace. It was impossible to see what lay within the palace.\n\nThe rainbow light caught Han Sen off guard. It looked like the Crystal God Conch\u2019s rainbow.\n\nThe crystal of the Crystal Palace looked like the material that composed the Crystal God Conch\u2019s shell.\n\n\u201cIs that just a coincidence?\u201d Han Sen wondered, but he doubted that.\n\nNow Han Sen hesitated to continue forward. If the Crystal God Conch was a xenogeneic from Crystal Palace, it was possible that another deified xenogeneic might be inside, as well.\n\nHan Sen glanced over at Bao\u2019er and the little red bird atop Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder. They didn\u2019t seem concerned about the place, so that put him at ease a little.\n\nAs Han Sen was thinking, the team came before the gate of the Crystal Palace. And there, Lan Haixin looked at Han Sen. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was startled. He didn\u2019t know what Lan Haixin meant, but he couldn\u2019t reveal his confusion.\n\nSo, Han Sen kept looking at the gate of the Crystal Palace, pretending to be lost in thought.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already here. What are you waiting for? Do you not trust your mother? If she hadn\u2019t set the Crystal Palace gate to only open to your blood, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted her request.\u201d Lan Haixin looked at Han Sen coldly. \u201cNow that you know where the Crystal Palace lies, are you really going to try to back out of our deal?\u201d"
