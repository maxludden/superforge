You already had a plan for slowing Han Sen down?\u201d Flower King asked, looking at the spell that had been cast on Han Sen.\n\nMoon Wheel King said coldly, \u201cThe speed of those shoes may not mean much to us, and they wouldn\u2019t work if there were Dukes on the field. Against lower level opponents, however, they make the boy undefeatable. So, I had a plan to mitigate that.\u201d\n\nFlower King was shocked, and he said, \u201cThe Jade Turtle Spell comes from the remains of a deified turtle. There are only 1365 of them in existence. They can only be used once to suppress creatures and slow them down. Not even Kings can withstand them. After all these years, very few remain. It is a waste to use one on a Baron.\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King looked tired, and he said, \u201cThat is why Rebecca did not use it at first. She did not expect this spring could provide so much. But since the spring was so abundant, and the shoes were proving too much of a challenge, she had no choice but to use the spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe made a good decision. From how the spring has performed thus far, I\u2019m guessing that it will erupt another three or four times. It was worth using it. If we failed to bring back a single droplet, I doubt our wives would soon forgive us.\u201d Flower King and Moon Wheel King both looked at each other.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was near the spring\u2019s eye now. His legs felt as if they were made of lead. He used all the power he could to fuel his rabbit shoes, but he was still as slow as he would have been if he wasn\u2019t wearing the shoes at all.\n\nHan Sen wished to detach the spell card, but it stuck to him tightly. It was like it was magnetized to him and he couldn\u2019t remove it. In addition to his decreased speed, his jumping and flying abilities were restricted. But those aside, Han Sen could still use his power.\n\nSeeing Han Sen get hit by the turtle spell and fall next to the spring eye, Sword Know and the others were delighted. The Tego Earl ran forward with his tiger fist to strike Han Sen.\n\nWhen Han Sen had been able to use his rabbit shoes to full-effect, he had not been afraid of the attack. But now that he was so slow, he could not dodge the fist and its hammering light.\n\nHan Sen was next to the spring\u2019s eye, yes, but he was not worried. Han Sen summoned something from his Sea of Soul, a red mist suddenly wrapped up his right hand. It was like a glove made of silk.\n\nThis glove was obtained from the Red Mist Mink that Han Sen had killed before. It was a glove beast soul that increased the speed and power of Han Sen\u2019s hand.\n\nPerhaps it was because he had yet to match the Earl class of the item itself, but it only wrapped up one hand.\n\nBut to Han Sen, that would be enough. The Nobles he contended with were Earls at best, and what\u2019s more, they had only just become Earls. They\u2019d only be slightly stronger than the glove at best, and it was likely they were weaker.\n\nHan Sen donned the glove and clutched his Ghost Teeth Knife. Seeing the incoming strike headed for him, he did not try to evade it. Instead, he threw his own attack directly towards it.\n\nBecause Spell was not a Viscount yet, Han Sen could not use Jadeskin, Mutant Blood, nor the Dongxuan Sutra. He could only use The Story of Genes to fight the Tego Earl.\n\nEveryone there, seeing Han Sen fighting the Tego Earl, frowned. There was no way a Baron could hope to defeat the Tego Earl. Han Sen was not wearing his Marquise armor, either. He could be killed with a single punch.\n\nThe Tego Earl saw Han Sen slashing towards his fist, and he looked cold. He increased his speed, hoping to finish Han Sen for good.\n\nA black tiger punch of light came roaring towards Han Sen. It was probably going to turn him into dust.\n\nGhost Teeth Knife\u2019s blade was purple-black. Without any god light or godly presence, the attack that came forward to meet with the fist looked ordinary.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThat scary attack looked incredible, in the eyes of others. But it was cut open by the Ghost Teeth Knife. From top to bottom, it was sliced in two.\n\nGhost Teeth Knife and the Tego\u2019s fist came against each other, and a dong noise sounded. Han Sen stood where he was, unmoving. The Tego, on the other hand, went stumbling back four steps.\n\nThe fist had an obvious knife mark, and blood leaked between the Earl\u2019s fingers.\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d The Tego Earl was shocked. The other Earls were stunned, too.\n\n\u201cThat glove! There is something amiss with his glove! It is a powerful treasure that increases his strength and speed!\u201d Rebecca was the heir of a half-deity. She knew far more than an ordinary Earl, and she could immediately identify the problem.\n\nPang!\n\nBefore anyone\u2019s daze had been broken, the spring\u2019s eye unleashed another red light. More springwater was up for grabs.\n\n\u201cHis movement speed is being suppressed by the Jade Turtle Spell. He cannot steal any more from us, so ignore him!\u201d an Earl shouted.\n\nBut Rebecca and the other Earls had already realized this. Silently, they rushed after the springwater.\n\nRebecca and the others could tell that Han Sen\u2019s hand\u2019s speed and power had increased, but he was still slow to move. He could not fly or pose a significant threat in battle for them. But this belief made the Earl that made the call too comfortable; it\u2019s what prompted his shout. The others were moving already.\n\nA red light shot out of the spring\u2019s eye, as quick as lightning.\n\nRebecca and the others were prepared to steal the water this time, but just as the light came firing out, a hand snatched it a mere two meters above the ground. Then, many more red balls came out from the red mist spring\u2019s red beam.\n\nEveryone was shocked as they stared at Han Sen\u2019s hand. He was standing near the spring\u2019s eye, and they stared at him in a daze.\n\nThe springwater was random. When a droplet rose from the spring, it was initially moving at the speed of light. Not even a Marquise could capture one of those droplets at the moment it spawned. But Han Sen had managed to grab it with his bare hands. That was shocking.\n\n\u201cCoincidence?\u201d Rebecca wondered, not able to believe what she was seeing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d Night River King said, as his eyes froze on Han Sen.\n\nMoon Wheel King and the others had realized this, too. It wasn\u2019t by chance, and it shocked them all.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let him stay near the red mist spring!\u201d Sword Know was furious now. He slashed towards Han Sen. The Tego came at Han Sen from the other side."
