    "text": "Quickly, Han Sen noticed he was able to read the text contained within the diary. It was written in the ancient language of humans\u2014a text often used by the crystallizers. There were, however, a variety of symbols not even he could understand. All-in-all, he didn\u2019t understand everything together.\n\nThere were some formulas jotted down. Han Sen wasn\u2019t very good at science. He had learned a bit in school, but he had forgotten most of that by now.\n\nBut Han Sen was still able to tell he had never seen these formulas before. They were extremely complicated. Judging from the content of the book, the man had been trying to calculate something.\n\nHan Sen flicked through the pages of the book, and the man showed no reaction. As long as Han Sen made no noise, the man didn\u2019t mind his presence there. That\u2019s how it seemed, leastways.\n\nWhen the man didn\u2019t object to Han Sen\u2019s behavior, it made Han Sen feel safe enough to relax a little. So, he continued reading the diary. It must have been a draft of sorts. There were many random things jotted down.\n\nHowever, there were enough words and symbols that Han Sen did not understand to make the book unintelligible.\n\nHan Sen put the diary down and took a gander at the other books. They all seemed to concern themselves with science. There were ones based on quantum theory. Han Sen knew he would not understand those books.\n\nSince the books were in messy disarray, Han Sen decided to tidy them up. By doing that, he also hoped to find a book he might enjoy. And soon after, his breath caught. He saw a book titled The Story of Genes.\n\nThis was what Han Sen had retrieved from the Main Control Room of the crystallizers. Ever since that time, he hadn\u2019t found a single thing associated with the book.\n\nNot even Stay Up Late knew where The Story of Genes came from. He read it, shook his head, and thought it must be a prank. No one could use The Story of Genes, or even practice it. It was not something any creature could learn.\n\nHan Sen had never expected that he would find another copy in a place like this.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is just a coincidence. Maybe the title is the same, but it\u2019s not actually the same book.\u201d Han Sen tried to regather the composure of his thoughts, and then, flipped the book open.\n\nWhen he read the first line, he knew he had not been mistaken. This was indeed another copy of The Story of Genes. It was exactly the same.\n\nHan Sen kept reading the content, and word for word, it was the same.\n\nAside from the standard content, there were actually many notes explaining things. But they weren\u2019t related to how you\u2019d actually practice with the text. The notes were of a scientific nature.\n\nHan Sen read it all seriously, right up until he reached the end.\n\nThe content, from back to front, was the same as his own The Story of Genes. There was, however, an additional page. That page had nothing to do with how to practice the work, though. It was a summary.\n\nThe summary used an extensive vocabulary. Han Sen did not understand what was written until he reached the final line. It said the test had failed.\n\nThere was something else he understood, too. \u201cCannot figure out the requirements for practice. The Story of Genes theory does not make sense. Can I not create a god?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this guy the creator of The Story of Genes?\u201d Han Sen looked back at the man strangely.\n\nThe man was dressed in ordinary garments, but they were in tatters. He stood motionless, like a mannequin. He was focused, as if he was trying to hear something.\n\nHan Sen had something he wished to ask, but he knew that if he tried to ask anything, the man would simply tell him to be quiet.\n\nHan Sen kept sorting through the books on the table. There were books on many different subjects, from genes to quantum theory. Overall, Han Sen could not understand much.\n\nAfter Han Sen tidied up the books, he decided to sit and observe the man. The man really wasn\u2019t moving, and he was unsure how long the man could do this.\n\nHan Sen had almost fallen asleep when the man finally moved. He walked gently towards the table, looked down at Han Sen, and said, \u201cWho are you? Why have you come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Han Sen. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Han Sen asked happily.\n\n\u201cRun, or it will be too late for you to escape.\u201d The man looked annoyed.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen felt a chill, and he thought the man might try to fight him.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you are on a spirit\u2019s body. If it moves, it will travel through space,\u201d the man explained.\n\n\u201cYou mean the mountain is a creature?\u201d Han Sen asked with shock.\n\n\u201cWhat is so weird about that? There is plenty of life in this world,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mountain. How can a mountain have life? There are other creatures like birds and worms on this mountain,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThe man looked at him with disdain. \u201cYou have so many bacteria and parasites on you. Does the fact that they have life mean that you do not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am a living thing. The mountain is just a rock,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWho said rocks cannot possess life? It\u2019s like a piece of meat. You wouldn\u2019t say it is living, but it is a part of life,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. If the rock is like flesh, then why are we able to create mines? And why does the life of rock not resist? Like us; if someone was digging into our flesh, we\u2019d want to kill whoever was assaulting us,\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe man laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s because we are too fast!\u201d\n\n\u201cToo fast?\u201d Han Sen froze, unsure of what he meant.\n\nThe man explained. \u201cThe rock lives longer than we do. A billion years might only be a moment for them. Even if we do dig into its body, the rock might not even have the time to notice our presence. It cannot see what we do.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was frozen. He had never thought of things this way before.\n\nThe man looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou said we would kill anyone who harms, yes? But things aren\u2019t like that. What if we grow a sickness like cancer? It destroys our bodies, but often, we can\u2019t root out the thing that is killing us. When these things harm your body, you cannot do anything. Just like the rock is unable to do things about us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just a simple way for me to explain these things. The truth of such matters is far more complicated. If you are interested in learning more, read this. You will understand far better.\u201d The man gave Han Sen a book.\n\n\u201cMy scientific background is pretty bad. I might not understand.\u201d Han Sen felt awful saying this.\n\nThe man said, \u201cScientific research is all about simplifying the complicated things. You can let those other fools worry about science itself. This is a geno art I created, through the theory of rock creatures. Ordinary crystallizers can practice it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but the man looked outside and the spoke again. He said, \u201cYou should leave now. The spirit is going to move. Unless you want to travel far away with me, that is.\u201d"
