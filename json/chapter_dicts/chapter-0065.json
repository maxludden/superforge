    "text": "Before Han Sen teleported to God\u2019s Sanctuary, Qin Xuan called to ask him to go to the teleport station.\n\nWhen Han Sen came to station, Yang Manli gave him a cold stare and brought him to the office of Qin Xuan.\n\nQin Xuan was taking care of some business when he came in, so Han Sen had to sit aside and wait.\n\nAfter dealing with everything on hand, Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen and said, \"I plan to recommend you to Blackhawk Military Academy.\"\n\n\"Recommend me to Blackhawk Military Academy?\" Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure what she meant, as one could apply to military schools oneself and take the exam, no recommendation needed.\n\nQin Xuan knew what he was thinking and went on, \"Blackhawk Military Academy has special quotas every year for those specialized in archery. But even the specially recruited students must pass the entrance exam and fulfill certain requirements. You are good at archery so it\u2019s alright if you are lacking in fitness. That\u2019s why I plan to recommend you. Entering military school at an early stage and going through formal training will do you good.\"\n\nHan Sen was wondering what to say to decline Qin Xuan. On the one hand, he wasn\u2019t really interested in going to military schools. On the other hand, he had to leave Planet Roca if he was admitted to Blackhawk. And he couldn\u2019t leave his mother and sister behind.\n\nBut Han Sen found Qin Xuan was very enthusiastic to get him into a military school. If he didn\u2019t give her a reasonable explanation, she probably wouldn\u2019t let go of the matter. Also she meant well, so Han Sen also felt obliged to give her an explanation.\n\n\"Stationmaster, you are too kind, but I already have an ideal military school in mind and I\u2019m afraid I have to let you down,\" Han Sen frowned.\n\n\"Oh? Which military school do you have in mind?\" asked Qin Xuan curiously, surprised by his sudden motivation.\n\n\"I want to apply to Roca Military School,\" replied Han Sen, sticking out his chest.\n\nQin Xuan and Yang Manli both looked at him as if he were an idiot.\n\nYang Manli said grimly, \"Blackhawk is in top 50 in the Alliance and you are comparing it to Roca Military School, which is not even among top 1000?\"\n\nQin Xuan advised, \"Han Sen, you should really think about it. Roca Military School is no match to Blackhawk whether in faculty or facilities. You can\u2019t even practice operating warframes and warships in Roca Military School and you won\u2019t have good coaches in martial arts. If you graduate from Roca Military School, you won\u2019t have a bright future in the army. Why would you want to do that?\"\n\nHan Sen smiled wryly\u2014he could not tell Qin Xuan that he would like to enter Roca Military School just because it was close to home.\n\nYang Manli said, \"You were not qualified to be recommended by the stationmaster, but she broke the rules for you because she saw something in you. You need to think carefully.\"\n\nReady to reply her, Han Sen heard a knock on the door.\n\n\"Stationmaster, your data analysis is ready.\"\n\n\"Great, send it over.\" Qin Xuan turned on a smart device and a video was displayed.\n\nHan Sen took a look and was slightly surprised, as the video was his fight with the golden-horned Shura.\n\nIt was not, however, the edited version, but Fang Mingquan\u2019s original footage.\n\nA comprehensive data analysis was made and each movement of Dollar and the Shura was accompanied with detailed real-time combat stats including the agility, punching speed, critical strike and damage. There was also the scene of the dead Shura in the end. When the display was over, Qin Xuan asked Yang Manli, \"What do you think of Dollar?\"\n\n\"Stupid!\" was Yang Manli\u2019s reply.\n\nHan Sen who was secretly proud and ready for Yang Manli\u2019s compliments almost choked on his own saliva.\n\n\"Please explain,\" Qin Xuan did not seem to be surprised.\n\nYang Manli said, \"Dollar's strength and speed are very good. Although we do not know his exact fitness rating, he is definitely among the top in First God\u2019s Sanctuary when he shapeshifts. However, his strength and speed are still much weaker than the Shura. We could even estimate that he would have died a million times if the Shura weren\u2019t badly injured already.\"\n\nQin Xuan nodded, agreeing with Yang Manli.\n\nYang Manli continued, \"Dollar\u2019s wings look like advanced flying beast soul. Judging from his speed, it\u2019s very likely a sacred-blood beast soul. With such a flying beast soul, a fleet-footed shapeshifting beast soul, and great speed, he is the ideal archer. He should shoot arrows from afar instead of engaging himself in a stupid fist fight.\"\n\nQin Xuan smiled, \"You are right. But it was an emergency and it looked like Dollar wasn\u2019t good at archery. He has never used bow and arrows before and has always been fighting head on\u2014the complete opposite of this one.\"\n\nYang Manli knew Qin Xuan was referring to Han Sen and said, \"If Dollar can become an archer, he will be the best archer in First God\u2019s Sanctuary. His moving and flying speed will help him maintain his distance from the enemy, and his strength will allow him to shoot fast and powerful arrows. That\u2019s why he would be perfect.\"\n\nYang Manli did not mention Han Sen at all. Apparently, she doesn\u2019t think Han Sen could even be compared to Dollar.\n\nMoreover, Yang Manli might think Dollar's way of fighting was somewhat stupid, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was a respectable man, unlike Han Sen, who was a coward with some talent.\n\nQin Xuan sighed, \"Unfortunately, there was a blackout in the area because of the damage caused by the Shura aircraft, so we didn\u2019t get anything that can reveal the identity of Dollar. Although we have Dollar's blood sample, everyone\u2019s genes are changing rapidly these days as they gain geno points. So, by comparing the DNA in the sample and in our database, it\u2019s almost impossible to find out who he is.\"\n\n\"He has appeared on Planet Roca twice. Maybe it\u2019s not a coincidence,\" Yang Manli thought about it and suggested.\n\n\"I have checked the population on Planet Roca, and there isn\u2019t anyone that fits the profile. Roca is just a fifth-tier commercial planet. It\u2019s highly unlikely that someone like Dollar lives there, even less likely than winning the lottery,\" Qin Xuan shook her head.\n\nHan Sen was secretly relieved that the two did not associate the unambitious Han Sen with Dollar at all. He was afraid that the wings might remind them of the purple-winged dragon, but his caution proved to be unnecessary. The beast soul wings didn\u2019t look the same as the dragon\u2019s wings, and they were also covered in the black beetle armor, so it was difficult to associate the two together."
