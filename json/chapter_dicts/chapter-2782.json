    "text": "Bai Wanjie used a deified weapon to slice straight through a Flower God\u2019s brain. But even though its bisected brain and body fell into the soil, the creature healed so fast that the process could be seen with the naked eye. The creature was back on its feet in moments.\n\nThat big Space Garden was filled to the brim with the acoustics of killing. The Kings were basically all dead, and the deified elites themselves were not faring very well. Deified blood was everywhere.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Han Sen looked at Lone Bamboo. The talented Sky still had the power to fight, so Han Sen wasn\u2019t too worried about him. He grabbed Xie Qing King by the arm and flew tens of thousands of meters away, heading deeper into the Space Garden.\n\nThe lower reaches of the Space Garden weren\u2019t too safe, either, but Han Sen had detected the presence of Violet somewhere around there. Han Sen sensed that Violet and a few other Flower Gods had survived the violent rapture, and they must have escaped to someplace below.\n\nA few of the Flower Gods emerged, and Han Sen swung his fists to punch them away like sandbags.\n\nMany of the enraged beings tried to stop them, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t be stopped. He fought his way through the Space Garden to reach the deepest recesses of the realm. He eventually came before a tree, and he struck the trunk, knocking a big hole in it. The tree was apparently hollow, and Han Sen hauled Xie Qing King inside with him. Once they were inside, Flower Gods that were chasing them backed off.\n\n\u201cThis place seems weird,\u201d Xie Qing King said quietly as he followed.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is weird,\u201d Han Sen agreed with a nod, glancing around warily.\n\nThey were walking down a subterranean path, but the walls around them were not made of dirt or stone. They were very large vines that had woven themselves together like a solid wall. Furthermore, the vines were semi-transparent, and so they looked like blood vessels. Han Sen could barely make out the shape of the vines, but he could tell something was moving inside them.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t walked for very long when they suddenly saw the space ahead of them start to widen. It led to a giant, empty void. Countless tendrils had gathered together to form the walls of that giant underworld.\n\nHan Sen found Violet and the other Flower Gods there. They were standing in front of a huge vine that connected the floor to the ceiling.\n\n\u201cViolet, you are a very evil man. Your tricks have brought harm to a lot of good people. Do you think you can get away with such acts in this universe?\u201d Han Sen asked, walking slowly up to Violet.\n\nBut Violet and the others didn\u2019t even spare him a glance. Their hands were folded in a praying gesture, and they were mumbling something to themselves.\n\nViolet did answer him, though. He coldly said, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t do this, the Flower Gods would have become extinct. There would have been no future for our people.\u201d\n\nAs Violet spoke, Han Sen and Xie Qing King reached him. They looked at what he was keeping his attention on, and they saw a creature inside the pillar of tangled-up vines in the center of the enormous room. It was sitting there, and it looked like a giant.\n\nThe creature had to have been 100 meters tall. Its entire body was like jade. The surface of its flesh shimmered like crystal. Tentacles coiled around its body, latching onto the creature in various places. They kept absorbing a substance or energy out of the giant.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at the giant that looked like a jade statue. He felt a familiar presence from the giant.\n\n\u201cHe is God,\u201d Violet answered, his eyes looking very impassioned and earnest.\n\n\u201cGod? What kind of god is he?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cHe has no tier. He isn\u2019t like those rubbish deified creatures. This is an actual god. It is God, and God can do anything.\u201d Violet\u2019s expression looked like that of a deranged madman.\n\n\u201cHow do you know he is really God?\u201d Han Sen finally understood why that giant had a familiar presence. It was because, even though the being seemed to be dead, its body still had that feeling Han Sen despised. It wasn\u2019t really God. It was a god like King Jun.\n\n\u201cI just know it,\u201d Violet coldly grunted. Then, he quickly explained, \u201cThe Space Garden you have come to know used to be a small ganoderma lucidum. It was only the size of a man\u2019s hand. But due to an accident, the small ganoderma lucidum\u2019s spores landed on the god\u2019s dead body. It absorbed the god\u2019s power, and it has been growing all the way up until now. The ganoderma lucidum\u2019s body became its own xenogeneic space, and it spawned so many xenogeneic plants\u2026 If this being is not a god, then what sort of creature\u2019s corpse could offer such power?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the jade giant. For all he knew, gods couldn\u2019t attack creatures of the universe. But also, the creatures of the world shouldn\u2019t be able to touch them, either.\n\nIf that jade giant really was a god like King Jun, even if he died, it shouldn\u2019t be possible to use his corpse as a base that other beings could grow off of.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing? Could it really be the corpse of a god?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart pounded as he tried to think.\n\nBefore Han Sen could ask anything further, Violet kept on talking. He seemed pretty excited.\n\n\u201cOur ancestors witnessed the beginning of the ganoderma lucidum\u2019s parasitic claiming of the god\u2019s corpse, and they guarded this place with their lives. They tried to figure out what the god was, exactly. But they were never able to find out. Our race, however, started to grow many flowers on our heads. These flowers gave us the ability to evolve quickly. Although we have been developing quickly, we\u2019ve been struggling to catch up to the other creatures of the universe, which have been evolving for billions of years. The speed of our development has accelerated dramatically, though. It was like a big jump for our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter many generations of research, we finally found a way to absorb god\u2019s power directly\u2026 We just had to turn ourselves into plants. We have imitated the ganoderma lucidum\u2019s parasitic claiming of the god\u2019s corpse, in a way. It absorbed the god\u2019s corpse\u2019s power, and we intend to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that your plan is going all that well. Those Flower Gods have power, but it looks like they were driven insane in the process.\u201d Han Sen now understood why the Flower Gods suddenly possessed such frightening levels of power. It was due to them leeching off the god corpse\u2019s energy.\n\n\u201cYes. But we can say that we succeeded as much as we can say we failed. We used the tentacles of the Space Garden to allow ourselves to absorb the god corpse\u2019s power faster. We don\u2019t need to eat the xenogeneic plants to gain god\u2019s power anymore. This way is faster, and our people are evolving much faster, which proves that our theory was correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, it was impossible for us to gain a deified elite. But right now, after directly absorbing the power from the god\u2019s corpse, everyone has started to become deified like it was the easiest thing in the world.\u201d\n\nAs he said this, Violet\u2019s face was brimming with pride. \u201cBut it is a shame. Right now, at this time, a complication has shown up in the bodies of most of my people. They cannot handle the power of the god, and so they have started to become plants. Even their thoughts are starting to decompose. They even buried themselves in the soil to behave more like a plant\u2026 But I am different\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you different?\u201d Han Sen knew this was the most important point. He stared at Violet, who was looking more insane with every minute that passed.\n\nViolet\u2019s face looked so prideful; it couldn\u2019t be described. \u201cI am the chosen one. I can accept God\u2019s power. I won\u2019t become a vegetable like the rest of my people. I do, however, have a minor issue. I have to pass a test that God himself gave me.\u201d"
