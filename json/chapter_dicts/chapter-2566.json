Exquisite\u2019s power exploded with the strength of a deified. He had no idea how she had accomplished something like that.\n\n\u201cHow do I escape this?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t have time to contemplate how Exquisite might have unleashed the amount of power that she had. His escape took precedence.\n\nBut the strength of this Crocodile God was beyond his imagination. He didn\u2019t think he had the power to fight against something that scary.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t decided on how he should escape when he heard another loud noise. Exquisite had just used Space Teleportation to break free, but she fell out of it and landed back on the planet. She lay where she was, coughing up blood. Her expression didn\u2019t look remote and untouchable now. She looked like she was in trouble.\n\nHan Sen was stunned. \u201cExquisite already used Space Teleportation. Why is she back? This is so scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird Sister,\u201d Li Keer said hesitantly. It shook her to see Exquisite like that. She asked, \u201cThird Sister, what happened?\u201d\n\nExquisite was unable to speak. Blood was still gushing out of her mouth. She had used the Very High Spell to break the rules of gravity and escape. She traveled away from the planet for a time, but when the Very High Spell was exhausted, the terrifying power of the creature yanked her back down.\n\nIt was like a rubber band. The further away she got, the harder her descent was. Now, most of her organs had ruptured. This wouldn\u2019t kill her, but with the pressure of the planet\u2019s gravity, the pain was excruciating.\n\nIf she had met an ordinary primitive deified, she could have dealt with all of this. Exquisite was a ninth-tier King with the Very High\u2019s geno arts, after all. But against that Crocodile God, without the Very High Spell, it was doubtful many of the Very High could survive. The level gap was way too big.\n\nAfter seeing the condition that Exquisite was now in, Li Keer knew that it was lucky that she had hesitated to use her Very High Spell. She merely looked at Exquisite, hoping the other woman\u2019s recovery would be swift.\n\nAt that moment, the Crocodile God was only ten meters away from them. Its small crocodile eyes peered at them like it was toying with them.\n\nThe Crocodile God looked over them for a while. Its attention was mostly on Exquisite, though, and it climbed over to her slowly.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He didn\u2019t know if he could escape this. He wasn\u2019t even thinking about saving Exquisite, who had been unkind to him.\n\nBut Li Keer had taught him Space Teleportation. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to sit back and watch her die. Right now, the Crocodile God was focused on Exquisite. He could take Li Keer away.\n\nAs Han Sen hesitated, the Crocodile God slapped the ground, and the ground shook. The three of them were bounced away. Exquisite was closest to the Crocodile God, and so she flew the highest.\n\nThe Crocodile God swung its tail. It smacked Exquisite and sent her flying.\n\nHan Sen fell onto the ground hard. He watched Exquisite fly through the air. The blow hadn\u2019t been as devastating as he thought it would be. When she landed, Han Sen watched her manage to get up.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t sure what to do, and the crocodile\u2019s tail struck another two times. It sent Han Sen and Li Keer flying as well. It was like baseball\u2014one tail swing per person as it hurled them through the air.\n\nThe Crocodile God\u2019s tail was very powerful, but the creature was controlling its power very carefully. Han Sen didn\u2019t feel as if much strength had been used to strike his body. It was more like he was just being tossed away. He landed next to Exquisite. Li Keer hit the ground beside them, as well.\n\nThe strangest thing was, this place looked similar to the rest of the planet. But the force of gravity on them had now been relieved.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Crocodile God\u2019s rules of gravity that had been lifted, either. The planet\u2019s weighty, natural gravity was gone, too.\n\nHan Sen and Li Keer stood up. They ambled around until they noticed the ground had turned from dark red to black. There was a hole nearby.\n\n\u201cCould this be the Crocodile God\u2019s cave? Why did it send us here? Is it going to save us for a snack?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself.\n\n\u201cThird Sister, are you okay?\u201d Li Keer was holding the injured Exquisite.\n\nExquisite shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s only my organs that have been damaged. I am fine. Don\u2019t use Space Teleportation just yet. The Crocodile God\u2019s area of gravity is too strong. Even if we teleport away, its powers are bound to pull us back down.\u201d\n\nHan Sen agreed with that prediction, so he didn\u2019t think about teleporting away to make an escape. His teleportation abilities were still new, too. He couldn\u2019t do Space Teleportation yet.\n\nIf Exquisite couldn\u2019t escape, then he couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nThe Crocodile God swung its tail threateningly from side to side, but Han Sen wasn\u2019t too afraid of it. If the Crocodile God wanted to kill them, it would have done so earlier. There was no need for it to send them over here.\n\nPerhaps the Crocodile God wanted to play a game of cat and mouse, but whatever the case ended up being, it didn\u2019t seem as if their deaths were on the tablet just yet.\n\nAs Han Sen tried to guess what the Crocodile God wanted to do, he suddenly heard the sound of something crawling coming from the cave. He spun around in surprise, and he thought to himself, \u201cIs there more than one Crocodile God?\u201d\n\nExquisite and Li Keer heard the sound, as well. They turned to face the entrance of the cave. They quickly saw another crocodile emerge from the pit.\n\nThis crocodile was even smaller, no more than one foot long. Its body was pitch black, and its scales were very tight. They shone with a metallic luster. Due to the fact it was so small, it didn\u2019t look very menacing. It actually looked rather cute. It was like a metal doll.\n\nBut its small eyes looked at them with scorn in exactly the same way that the Crocodile God had. The eyes were a sharp contrast with the creature\u2019s cute body.\n\n\u201cIs this the Crocodile God\u2019s child?\u201d Han Sen looked at the small crocodile with shock. It wasn\u2019t just small, it also looked rather young. It looked like a baby.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer looked very surprised. To their knowledge, the core area\u2019s xenogeneics came from the core hall. Few core xenogeneics ever gave birth. But this Crocodile God had produced an heir right here. It was such a rare thing to witness in the core area.\n\nAmidst their confusion, the small Crocodile God found them. Excitement washed over the creature\u2019s face in an almost human expression.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe small Crocodile God was so excited that a black light began to shine from its body. Han Sen and the others were covered in the light, and then, the three of them dropped to the ground again. They were pinned down, their faces glued to the dirt.\n\n\u201cHow could it be\u2026 born deified\u2026\u201d Exquisite and Li Keer gasped, almost losing their voices. They looked at the little creature in disbelief."
