    "text": "Boom!\n\nPurple light shot into the sky. It became an empty sky crack in space. A silent, sad mind was all across the universe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a god\u2019s sadness\u2026 That is a god\u2019s sadness\u2026 Dollar killed\u2026 It is a real god spirit\u2026\u201d In the universe, many spirits were looking at the god\u2019s sadness appear in space. They were all in shock.\n\nOrdinary creatures were doubting Sky God Armor\u2019s identity. When the god\u2019s sadness showed up, they stopped doubting. \u201cOh, my God! Dollar really did kill a god spirit.\u201d \u201cThe human Dollar. Can someone tell me what sort of race a human is?\u201d\n\nneo\n\n\u201cThis is madness. Another god\u2019s sadness. This era is madness. Is the chaos of the Sacred era repeating?\u201d\n\nThe elites who knew what Sky God Armor meant looked at the god\u2019s sadness weirdly. They even lost interest in talking.\n\nA butterfly xenogeneic had managed to kill a god spirit, and he was holding a god personality armament in his hands. They wanted to know who this Dollar was.\n\nMany elites used all kinds of tricks to learn his identity, yet none of them were able to uncover who the elusive Dollar was.\n\nGod stared at Han Sen and thought, Why would he have Sky Vine Radish\u2019s spirit? Why would it be controlled by him? Is there some sort of power restricting Sky Vine Radish\u2019s spirit?\n\nAfter the fight was over, Dollar\u2019s name was known across the entire universe.\n\n\u201cThis Dollar is a little weird. If Little Mountain leader encounters him, there might be some trouble,\u201d the green-haired beast said with a look of seriousness. He was very confident in Golden Growler\u2019s abilities.\n\nAfter watching Han Sen defeat Sky Armor God, he was not so sure if Golden Growler was capable of achieving first place.\n\nThe woman near him coldly said, \u201cHe was able to defeat Sky Armor God not through his own power, but on a weird geno art and the god personality armament. He is just a butterfly class opponent. The god personality armament is strong. With his butterfly body\u2019s movement, he cannot beat Little Mountain Leader. That geno art he has is a law power. It is similar to the second leader of the Extreme King\u2019s power. That power is useless against the Little Mountain Leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to say that, but this Dollar guy is strange. It is like there are some problems with him,\u201d the green-haired beast said with a frown. He could not identify what the problem was.\n\nHan Sen returned to the garden. God looked at him like he was smiling, but he was not smiling.\n\nHan Sen knew that God would be suspicious about his ability to make use of the Sky Vine Radish. He was not surprised.\n\nIt did surprise Han Sen that while God did look at him, he did not ask anything.\n\nHan Sen looked at God with curiosity as he asked, \u201cDo you not want to ask anything?\u201d \u201cIf there is something you wanted to tell me, you would tell me without me asking,\u201d God coldly said. \u201cIf you did not want to say something, you would not answer me even if I asked you. Why would I bother asking?\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you good at talking deals? Maybe I will tell you if you talk about deals.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nGod shook his head and smiled. He said, \u201cI prefer to discover secrets myself. Things are more interesting that way.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He did not expect God would say such a thing. The plans he had made were useless now. He suddenly did not know what to say.\n\n\u201cSky Vine Radish\u2019s god temple\u2026 Sky Armor God has one too, right? Can you take me there again?\u201d Han Sen had two god personalities. If he did not go to the temple, the god personality seemed useless. Han Sen had yet to find a way how to refine the god personalities he had.\n\nGod shook his head. \u201cNo. You can go there, but you will have to go there by yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I get there?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYou will know when you enter the geno hall,\u201d God said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen was speechless. He guessed the temples might have been inside the geno hall, but he did not think he could go to the geno hall just yet.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. Han Sen kept watching the god fights, trying to observe the opponents he might later go up against.\n\nBecause the opponent in the next round had yet to finish, Han Sen did not know who he would be going up against. He knew none of his future opponents would be easy. The geno god fights had been going on for a while. There were no more weaklings. They were all top deifieds now.\n\nIn a palace in the Extreme King, Ancient Abyss Grandmaster bowed and said, \u201cMister, the eye skill Dollar used was similar to our second leader of the Extreme King, Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye. Holy Baby\u2019s body combined with the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye. He should be familiar with that geno art. \u201cDo you think Holy Baby is Dollar?\u201d Bai King put down his pen. He raised his head and looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.\n\n\u201cThey are both very similar,\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said. \u201cAlthough Holy Baby might not be Dollar, if Dollar can use a law skill to beat a god spirit, perhaps Mister Holy Baby can too.\u201d \u201cSure, I will deal with this,\u201d Bai King slowly said. \u201cIs there anything more?\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster sighed and said, \u201cThere is progress in the big barren systems. I have calculated the location of the entrance to the old Sacred ruin, but we have run into some trouble.\u201d \u201cWhat trouble?\u201d Bai King asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cSky Palace\u2019s people were there,\u201d Ancient Abyss said. \u201cI am afraid they located the entrance too. We are asking for your advice.\u201d\n\nBai King was silent a moment before saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything yet. If Sky Palace wants to go in, let them go in first. We will follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I understand.\u201d Ancient Abyss bowed and left the palace.\n\nAfter Ancient Abyss left, Bai King thought, Holy Baby. He reached his hand out to take something, but quickly pulled his hand back. He shook his head and said, \u201cWhatever. Things are already in motion. There is no turning back. We have to keep going.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought it was Bai King who had come looking for him to ask about the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye. Surprisingly, Bai King did not go and find him.\n\nDoes the power in my left eye that different from the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye that Bai King did not even suspect anything? Han Sen wondered.\n\nGod seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. He laughed and said, \u201cThe Extreme King must have their suspicions on you, but Bai King is here. Even if they do, they cannot do anything to you.\u201d \u201cIs Bai King not suspicious?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course, he is not suspicious,\u201d God said with certainty.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen did not understand why Bai King was not suspicious.\n\n\u201cBecause he knows you are Dollar. There is no need to be suspicious if he knows.\u201d God laughed. \u201cHuh? Why doesn\u2019t he ask anything?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s suspicions were not minimized because of the answer.\n\n\u201cBecause there is no need to ask,\u201d God said. \u201cIt does not matter if you are Dollar or not. To him, all that matters is that you keep living.\u201d \u201cWhy does he want me to keep living?\u201d Han Sen was even more confused.\n\nGod laughed and did not answer. He said, \u201cAfter winning one more round, you will breach the top 100. Then, you will be able to leave your name on the geno god list. Will you feel successful?\u201d"
