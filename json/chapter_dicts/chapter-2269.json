Is the holy monument inside the tree?\u201d\n\nMister White stepped forward in alarm. \u201cPlease do not touch it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Fox Queen and Han Sen both looked at Mister White.\n\nMister White said, \u201cThis tree is very sturdy, and it has been infused with a special magnetic force that repels all xenogeneics. Inside the trunk, however, is a Shatter Space Crystal.\u201d\n\n\u201cShatter Space Crystal?\u201d One of Fox Queen\u2019s eyebrows rose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mister White confirmed gravely.\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cWhat is a Shatter Space Crystal?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a material that is used to construct teleportation devices,\u201d Harder explained. \u201cUsing one of those crystals in a device will greatly extend the device\u2019s range. It is the best-known material to use when crafting teleportation devices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means there is a teleportation device inside that tree? We can use it to visit the holy monument?\u201d Han Sen asked, starting to catch on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the theory,\u201d Mister White nodded. \u201cBut you must open the tree to gain access to the teleporter that is located inside it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith our big sister\u2019s power, tearing down the tree to reveal the crystal should be easy, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Han Sen questioned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Fox Queen replied in a distracted tone. \u201cShatter Space Crystals are unparalleled in their use for teleportation technology, but they are also very fragile. And the tree and the Shatter Space Crystal have been integrated very carefully. They are one with each other. If we use force to bring down the tree, the Shatter Space Crystal on the inside will be broken. That would completely ruin the device on the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt fortunate that you have the key, then. You simply need to use the key to open the tree\u2019s door,\u201d Mister White said.\n\nHan Sen felt worry descend on him. He hadn\u2019t known that the stone tablet would be the key required to open that device. The piece of crystal he had given Fox Queen was little more than the makeshift paperweight. It was going to be impossible for her to gain access to that device.\n\n\u201cHow do we use it?\u201d Fox Queen looked at the brick in her hands, then back at Mister White.\n\n\u201cIf our theory is correct, then there must be a keyhole.\u201d Mister White looked hesitant as he spoke.\n\n\u201cBut there is no hole in the tree\u2019s surface that is this big.\u201d Fox Queen looked at Han Sen, the suspicion clearly visible in her eyes. She already thought that Han Sen had given her a fake.\n\n\u201cI really did take that item from Ghost Bone Town. Keep looking; you should be able to use it.\u201d Han Sen pretended to observe the tree, feigning innocence.\n\n\u201cOver there!\u201d Han Sen suddenly pointed to the crown of the tall tree, looking very excited.\n\nFox Queen and the others looked at where Han Sen was pointing, but they couldn\u2019t see anything special.\n\nAs the others were distracted, Han Sen leaped back onto the blood kirin. A bird\u2019s nest appeared in his hand, and he held the nest out to protect himself from Fox Queen\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe blood kirin roared and streaked toward the tree.\n\nFox Queen was the quickest to react. She threw her hands forward, sending countless cords of power chasing after Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen put his hand into the concave part of the bird\u2019s nest, and suddenly it began to grow larger. It became a giant shield that stopped the pursuing cords of power.\n\nAs the blood kirin arrived at the old tree, Han Sen brought out the real stone plate. He shoved it into a moon-shaped indent in the surface of the tree, and the stone plate slotted into it perfectly.\n\nKatcha-cha!\n\nThe old tree suddenly broke open to reveal a large frame contained within the trunk. A shining orb of twisted space hung in the center of the frame, filled with spiraling, fractallic patterns. It was so bright that it was barely visible through the light.\n\nThe blood kirin carried Han Sen into the orb. Space seemed to fold around them for an instant, and then they vanished.\n\nFox Queen leaped after them. The dimensions of space were twisted, and she too disappeared with Han Sen.\n\nIce Blue Knight King gritted his teeth and ran inside, as well. Mister White, Crime, and Harder also decided to follow. They didn\u2019t want to give up on claiming the Sacred Leader\u2019s legacy here, after everything they had been through.\n\nHan Sen set the bird\u2019s nest atop his head. When the space around him untwisted and deposited him back in reality, he found himself standing in a palace. The stone tablet was back in his hands. He quickly activated his Purple-Eye Butterfly and looked around.\n\nHe was standing in a jade stone palace. There were many strange statues around him, fashioned in the images of animals, gods, and demons of all kinds.\n\nThe walls and the ceiling were covered in strange paintings. They didn\u2019t look like drawings or precise script, but they did seem to be symbols of some kind. Behind Han Sen, the teleporter began to shift again.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Han Sen shouted. It appeared as if someone else was coming. He nudged the blood kirin, urging it to hurry toward the palace gate.\n\nThe palace gate was open, and a white light was shining through it. It seemed like the light had been placed there intentionally to block any view of what lay beyond, and not even Han Sen\u2019s Purple-Eye Butterfly could pierce that veil.\n\nHan Sen was so desperate to get away from Fox Queen that he ignored the possibility of encountering traps. He and the blood kirin raced through the light.\n\nThe blood kirin carried Han Sen through the palace\u2019s front gate, and both of them felt space twisting in the same manner it had with the teleporter. When Han Sen\u2019s vision returned, he found himself inside another palace. He was standing before its teleporter.\n\nIt was different from the first palace, though. This palace didn\u2019t have half as many statues or paintings. In the middle of the palace, however, there was a fruit tree.\n\nThe fruit tree only stood about two meters high. Its body was like a plum tree, but it was wrought of twisted black steel. The branches seemed crooked and crudely made.\n\nThe leaves on the tree were silver, and the fruit hung like egg-sized silver sycees.\n\nHan Sen counted eight silver sycees on the tree. They were all of the same size, and they all looked silver-white. At the bottom of each sycee was a unique pattern that appeared to have been branded into it.\n\n\u201cSilver treasures?\u201d Han Sen had a closer look. Words were woven into the pattern.\n\n\u201cIs this tree manmade?\u201d Han Sen looked at the teleporter behind him. The teleporter remained silent and inactive, which made Han Sen feel uneasy.\n\nWith Fox Queen\u2019s speed, she should have caught up with him by now. How was it possible that she was not there yet?\n\n\u201cWhen I traveled through the palace gate, did the light there send me someplace else?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. Aside from that, he couldn\u2019t think of another reason why Fox Queen wouldn\u2019t have caught up with him.\n\nHe was happy about this turn of events regardless of the reason, though. Without her on his heels, he felt a lot safer. Han Sen decided to look at the silver treasure again.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, then put on his Galactic Lobster armor. He walked directly to the tree and pulled out his knife to cut down one of the silver treasures.\n\nThe Ghost Teeth Knife shrieked across the steel surface of the tree. Instead of severing the twig, the knife had only left a light mark upon it. The mark did produce some blood-like sap, though.\n\n\u201cThis tree is alive!\u201d Han Sen looked rather surprised. The sap welled with energy.\n\nHan Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the silver treasure fruit tree. He quickly confirmed that it really was a living tree. It had been there for many years, growing from a small sapling to what it was now.\n\nWith the Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen was able to observe a timeline that spanned a billion years."
