It did not look fleshy and scrumptious, though; it looked quite dry.\n\nBut as random as its sudden appearance had been, Han Sen did not sense any danger stemming from it. And as he studied it, he re-evaluated his perception and thought it looked more like a circular chunk of mushroom. The whitish color was a little jaded, too.\n\nIt was as round as a yoga ball, and when it came tumbling down, it bounced from rock to rock.\n\nHan Sen thought it changed color as it descended, too. But that was incorrect, as he later noticed it was just coated in splotches of blood. Quite disturbing.\n\nWhen the ball stopped moving, Han Sen fancied approaching it for a closer examination. He particularly wanted to see where the blood had come from. Before Han Sen could touch the blood, though, the ball moved away by its own volition.\n\nHan Sen was shocked by the sudden movement. He looked at the ball which had leaped away from him, but he could not notice anything special about it that might have prompted the sudden jump.\n\nThe white ball was like any old, unremarkable object. It didn\u2019t appear to be something living, and after it moved away from Han Sen, it returned to a motionless state.\n\nHan Sen walked forward, and when he was at a distance where he was close enough to touch it, the ball rolled away again. Han Sen could not sense a lifeforce stemming from the white ball, but it certainly behaved as if it was a living creature.\n\nThe ball did not roll quickly, so Han Sen picked up the pace for his next attempt at touching it. But when Han Sen\u2019s speed increased, so too did the speed of the ball\u2019s attempt to escape.\n\nBao\u2019er thought the ball was quite interesting, too. So, she leaped towards it with a crazy speed. When she almost touched the ball, the object was able to match her speed in an evasion.\n\nBao\u2019er landed on the ground in a bad way, as her hat and sunglasses were dashed across some rocks. The ball then began to jump around Bao\u2019er. It didn\u2019t make any noise, but it behaved as if it was mocking her.\n\nHan Sen did not know why he felt that was what the ball was doing.\n\nBut Bao\u2019er also seemed to believe that was what it was doing, and she became incredibly angry in response. She was furious.\n\nShe jumped up and ran towards it like a pouncing tiger. Her speed was almost teleportation-like, and a match for Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit mode.\n\nBut strangely, Bao\u2019er was still unable to catch the ball. It effortlessly matched her speed again and dodged her raging grab. The ball was quicker than the casting of a shadow.\n\nMissing this attempt did not hamper her desire to grab the ball, though. She quickly spun around and tried to get ahold of it once more. She jumped from rock to rock in an attempt to touch the ball, very much like an angered tiger that possessed wings.\n\nHan Sen was taken aback by what he was witnessing; Bao\u2019er was using his phoenix techniques. Han Sen had performed it in front of her many times, but he had never seen her train with it. For her to now just do it all of a sudden, it surprised him.\n\nHan Sen watched their play continue for a while. Many times over, Han Sen was able to confirm that Bao\u2019er was indeed using his phoenix techniques and original self-made modifications.\n\nYet despite all her attempts, the ball was able to dodge her every single time. It was remarkably nimble, that was for certain.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself. With a speed like that, it would have to be a super creature of sorts, assuming it was a creature. But despite repeated attempts at scanning the ball, he was still unable to pick up the trace of a lifeforce.\n\nIt had no eyes, nose, or orifices of any kind. Without a mouth, it couldn\u2019t have been a super creature.\n\nBao\u2019er was getting frustrated with her inability to catch the playful ball, so she pulled out her mini gourd and pointed it at the ball. Then, she slapped the gourd.\n\nA scary power of suction swirled out towards the ball.\n\nAt first, it helplessly succumbed to the suction and began to roll towards the gourd. But eventually, it seemed to find its grip and begin to effectively resist Bao\u2019er\u2019s terribly powerful gourd.\n\nThe gourd was a most mighty weapon, and it had never failed before. Its suction conjured a vortex similar to a wheel, endlessly spinning.\n\nThe ball, with its grip, was digging into the ground in a bid to resist. Deep skid marks were being left in its wake.\n\nNeedless to say, Han Sen was flabbergasted. This was the first time Han Sen had ever witnessed the gourd struggle to nab a target.\n\nThe gourd was unable to draw in the ball, but neither could the ball wholly escape. It was like a wheel fighting to get out of the mud or snow.\n\nHan Sen was met with an uneasy feeling in his stomach. If something was so powerful it could resist the gourd, he knew he\u2019d have to be more wary and not behave so playfully with it. So he drew his Phoenix Sword and activated his nine gene locks. The sword was dyed red, and then Han Sen swung it at the ball.\n\nThe ball couldn\u2019t afford to loosen its grip and avoid the strike, so the sword found its target.\n\nBut when the sword met the ball, Han Sen felt something wasn\u2019t quite right."
