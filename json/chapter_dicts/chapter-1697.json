    "text": "Golden Growler was like Han Sen. He hadn\u2019t matured after ascending, and his fitness was worse than Gugia\u2019s and Buck\u2019s. But the power of his geno armor closed the gap and fixed this issue. Golden Growler and his gold geno armor were quite compatible, and the creature could make use of 60% of its power. That was higher than Gugia\u2019s compatibility with his. It was through this large buff that he could beat Gugia.\n\nGugia acknowledged this, and his face looked grim. The onlookers Rudy and Yake had the same expression, too. They had no way of expecting there\u2019d be a geno armor creature dining with Han Sen, let alone one with such incredible strength.\n\nGugia grunted. He jumped up like a silver shadow and avoided Golden Growler\u2019s attack. He went behind Golden Growler and attacked his head.\n\n\u201cMere power is not the end-all-be-all.\u201d Gugia looked cold. His fist was right on the precipice of coming into contact with Golden Growler\u2019s head.\n\nBut in the next second, Gugia noticed Golden Growler was no longer in front of him. He\u2019d disappeared. His target was missing.\n\nGolden Growler hadn\u2019t actually disappeared, though. He just became smaller, shrinking to a size that was a better match for fighting Gugia. If his current size was compared to that of an elephant, he now reduced his size to something that was more like an ant It because of this, Gugia lost his target.\n\nWhen Gugia reconfirmed his foe\u2019s location, Golden Growler was running like mad. He flashed by Gugia like lightning, his claws leaving rips in Gugia\u2019s armor that leaked blood.\n\nGolden Growler had gotten smaller, but his speed increased. He changed from a strength-type to a speed-type.\n\nWhen Gugia fought Golden Growler, he was constantly suppressed by the lion. Golden Growler could switch between strength and speed on a whim, and it gave Gugia a proper headache.\n\n\u201cRudy, make it quick!\u201d Yake frowned at Rudy as Golden Growler appeared and disturbed their plan.\n\nRudy nodded, and a sky-blue geno armor appeared on him. His devilish body flew forward. Suddenly, he moved behind Golden Growler, sandwiching the lion between himself and Gugia.\n\nAs Rudy moved toward Golden Growler, a holy light shone from the garden. The next second, an ange\u535clike woman wrth holy armor appeared. Her hands were like swords, slashing down toward his fists.\n\nKatcha!\n\nRudy noticed his gauntlets were broken. His skin was cut and bleeding.\n\n\u201cAnother powerful geno armor creature.\u201d Rudy\u2019s face looked ill.\n\nThe humble Han family had hidden two creatures with geno armor in their midst That was beyond what anyone had expected. It was already difficult to become a god, let alone gain geno armor.\n\nGod\u2019s Organization, from the time of its establishment, had only managed to collect ten. There were two right here, and they sure looked mighty powerful.\n\nYake frowned. Things were definitely not going as expected. Han Jinzhi hadn\u2019t appeared, and they had already lost three god-class creatures. Rudy and Gugia were suppressed now, as well.\n\nHan Yufei was in shock. He had thought that Han Sen had killed Snake Witch, but he did not expect Han Sen to have two creatures with geno armor that might have done the task for him. And there they were now, suppressing Rudy and Gugia.\n\nJi Yanran was so happy. Little Angel and Golden Growler were attacking, and the dangerous fight looked like something petty that would soon be over. Stay Up Late looked at Little Angel and Golden Growler strangely. He already thought the Han family was weird, but this was weirder than even he had expected.\n\nStay Up Late could tell their geno armors were not their own, though. \u201cTwo beings that have been approved to use geno armor\u2026 If they could generate their own, could they be qualified?\u201d\n\nLittle Angel and Golden Growler suppressed Rudy and Gugia. Yake\u2019s eyes changed then, and his body began to transform. It seemed as if he wanted to fight and sort out this situation out himself.\n\nHan Yufei knew Han Sen was not there. And he didn\u2019t suspect the Han family might actually have a third geno armor to fight against Yake.\n\nHan Yufei knew Yake was stronger than Rudy and Gugia, though. He was at an even higher tier in God\u2019s Organization.\n\nHan Yufei looked like he cared little for the fight. He kept watching Yake. And just as Yake was about to attack, Han Yufei gathered up a massive amount of power and punched him from behind.\n\nThe silent and powerful punch was driven right into Yake\u2019s back.\n\nHan Yufei hadn\u2019t generated geno armor, and his fitness was similar to Buck\u2019s. He had to find an effective way to assassinate Yake.\n\nWhen Yake was about to strike, that was the time his guard would be lowered. He\u2019d only have one chance of taking him out. And that chance would be gone for good if Yake thought about putting on his geno armor.\n\nHan Yufei was not cocky enough to think he could defeat Yake when he was wearing his geno armor. Geno armors were not all the same, or on the same level.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Yufei\u2019s fist went right into Yake\u2019s back. It was powerful enough to sunder a mountain, but his face swiftly changed.\n\nSuch powerful strength landed on Yake, and yet, Yake had suddenly donned a steel looking armor. His punch went against it, dealing zero damage. And it was like his hand had gotten stuck inside the metal. He couldn\u2019t get it back out\n\n\u201cYou have a problem.\u201d Yake turned around to look at Han Yufei. His expression was murderous.\n\nHan Yufei did not talk, and he simply threw another fist at his enemy\u2019s body.\n\nYake grabbed Han Yufei\u2019s hand, though, and proceeded to speak. \u201cYou think I\u2019m like one of them? You are very wrong. Your skills might work against the likes of Rudy, but to me, it was a really dumb move. I have self geno armor, and that is a very different thing.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Yake used his hand to break Han Yufei\u2019s arm. Han Yufei\u2019s face turned white as his arm was twisted. He started to develop a cold sweat His fist could not reach Yake, and neither could he run off.\n\n\u201cGoto hell!\u201d Yake\u2019s other fist was fast-approaching Han Yufei\u2019s head with power."
