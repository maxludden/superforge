    "text": "While Miss Mirror was speaking with two of the four Spring Rain Kings, whose names were Red Cloud and Night Wind, a sound erupted from Han Sen\u2019s place, interrupting their discussion.\n\n\u201cI am stupid!\u201d someone screamed.\n\nThe three of them swapped strange glances. The voice undeniably belonged to Falling Leaf, but they couldn\u2019t believe Falling Leaf would ever yell those words.\n\nAside from Miss Mirror and the four Kings of Spring Rain, Falling Leaf was known as one of Spring Rain\u2019s best. She was a very cruel woman, but she worked hard. She was proud, violent, and always ready for a fight. How could those words pass through the mouth of someone like that?\n\n\u201cWas that who it sounded like?\u201d Night Wind turned to Red Cloud and Miss Mirror with a confused expression.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll end things here for now. You two can go home.\u201d Miss Mirror frowned. She stood up and went to Han Sen\u2019s place. She wanted to see what Han Sen was up to.\n\nA woman like Falling Leaf wasn\u2019t someone who could be forced to say anything of the sort. She would rather die than make that sort of admission.\n\nIf Han Sen had used some trick to fool Falling Leaf, Miss Mirror wouldn\u2019t ignore such a transgression. She had sent Falling Leaf to look after Han Sen, but she wouldn\u2019t stand for the woman being bullied.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Han Sen asked with a pleasant smile when he answered the door and saw Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to Falling Leaf?\u201d Miss Mirror frowned.\n\n\u201cWhat did I do to her? I haven\u2019t spoken much with her. She\u2019s been playing with Bao\u2019er all this time. Go and take a look, if you want to.\u201d Han Sen moved aside and gestured for her to enter.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t believe Han Sen. She walked through the entry and went into the living room. There she found Falling Leaf playing card games with Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror!\u201d Falling Leaf shot to her feet and bowed.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Falling Leaf\u2019s forbidding face was covered in little stickers. The sight almost made Miss Mirror want to crack up in laughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Falling Leaf\u2019s face blushed deeply, but she didn\u2019t remove the pieces of paper stuck to her face. She was a killer, and killers always kept their word. She might have lost the game, but she wasn\u2019t going to disgrace the rules.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you are okay.\u201d Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen and said in a hard voice, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen shrugged and followed Miss Mirror into the garden.\n\n\u201cYou know Falling Leaf is one of my people. You should be careful how you choose to treat her.\u201d Miss Mirror settled herself into one of the garden chairs and looked at Han Sen as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t done a single thing to her, and I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to offend her, either. She is merely playing with Bao\u2019er. You can ask her if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good that you haven\u2019t mistreated her. I\u2019m just warning you, though. Don\u2019t do anything that will make her or me unhappy,\u201d Miss Mirror said in a firm voice.\n\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Han Sen shrugged again.\n\n\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d Miss Mirror was looking at the ring Han Sen wore, and her request came with the glimmer of hesitation.\n\nAlthough Han Sen wasn\u2019t a bad fighter, he was too low level. Miss Mirror didn\u2019t think Han Sen, with his current power, could be of much assistance to her. But since she was there, she knew it would be a good idea to get to know him a little better.\n\nThe mind and the heart were inseparably linked, so the best way to learn someone\u2019s personality was through their mind. It was a very accurate way of reading people.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Han Sen asked as he extended his right hand in front of Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cAre you playing dumb?\u201d Miss Mirror stared at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOf course not. You should have just told me more clearly.\u201d Han Sen laughed and pulled back his right hand. He extended his left hand instead, the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring glinting on one of his fingers.\n\nMiss Mirror observed the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring, and a lump rose in her throat. Seeing the ring made her mind harken back to the man who had once worn it. That man had been smart and gentle.\n\nEven now, thinking of that man made her heart leap.\n\nMiss Mirror never regretted marrying that man. Choosing him had been the most precious experience in her entire life, but God hadn\u2019t allowed her to be by his side forever.\n\nThinking of that man would have made any woman\u2019s heart jump, and then seeing the current master of the ring, Miss Mirror could only sigh.\n\nAlthough Han Sen was good, compared to that man, she thought he couldn\u2019t begin to compare.\n\nMiss Mirror reached out her hand and put her Mirror Spirit Eye Ring next to Han Sen\u2019s ring.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s face didn\u2019t possess supermodel-like beauty. She wasn\u2019t as hot as someone like Gu Qingcheng, certainly. She was more like a well-dressed and mature lady.\n\nBut Miss Mirror\u2019s hands were too pretty to criticize. Every finger was long and slender. Her skin was white like jade, and her nails glittered like crystals.\n\nHer hands were lovely and elegant. Han Sen had seen many pretty women in his time, but this was the first time he had ever seen such beautiful hands.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s hand came closer to Han Sen, and the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring reacted. The emerald ring began to glow.\n\nWhen those two eye-like gems touched each other, Han Sen and Miss Mirror both shivered. They felt a strange power generate in the Mirror Spirit Eye Rings, and then the power went into both of their bodies. The energy traveled up their arms and straight into their brains.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body vibrated. He looked around, finding himself in a place where it was raining. The springtime rain was falling as if God himself was crying.\n\nBut when those tears fell, they watered everything around him. The trees, the flowers, the grass, the chestnuts. The rain soaked into all of them, and the sadness held within the rain provided a source of infinite lifeforce and hope.\n\nHan Sen had studied the forty-eight water minds of Destiny\u2019s Tower, and the spring rain mind was one of them. Miss Mirror\u2019s mind was spring rain, but it wasn\u2019t focused on the rain itself.\n\nHan Sen felt the way her emotions shifted and swayed within her mind. Suddenly, he really admired this woman. This mind was professional and enduring. It was like the strongest a deified being could achieve.\n\n\u201cNo wonder her organization is called Spring Rain. This mind can only be felt. It isn\u2019t something that could be explained. Achieving this sort of mind is very difficult. Miss Mirror is a very complicated and even contradictory woman. I cannot judge her as I normally would another.\u201d As Han Sen observed and sensed the spring rain mind, he learned much from it.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s body shivered, too. She felt a mind inside her consciousness.\n\nBut that mind wasn\u2019t too strong or surprising. It didn\u2019t impress her much.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t take Han Sen\u2019s mind seriously, as she had only touched their rings together so she could learn more about him. But when the presence of his mind began to expand, Miss Mirror was stunned.\n\nWhat Miss Mirror saw, in terms of Han Sen\u2019s mind, was something akin to a flower ready to open. The mere bud might not have been very impressive, but as she tried to understand, she peeled away the petals. But try as she might, she couldn\u2019t peel them all away. She couldn\u2019t get to the center of the flower, and that disturbed her."
