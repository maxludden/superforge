Ordinary King class people wouldn\u2019t have that many saved up.\n\nEven a half-deified wouldn\u2019t have that many King xenogeneic genes in storage.\n\nApparently, Barr wasn\u2019t a man who had stocked up an unbelievable number of xenogeneic genes, either. So, his face looked pretty gloomy.\n\nWith his personality being what it was, he wouldn\u2019t have much in the way of wealth. Although he could kill xenogeneics, he wouldn\u2019t be stockpiling their genes.\n\nEven if he wanted to borrow them, he probably couldn\u2019t. He had no friends, after all. His only real friend was Dia Robber, but it was unlikely that Dia Robber had that many to part with either.\n\n\u201cSure. Wait until I collect the xenogeneic genes. When I have what you have asked for, I will seek you out again,\u201d Barr said. Then, he opened the core area hall and departed.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t too concerned about this. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was a big number. If most Kings couldn\u2019t pull that many out of storage, it was doubly doubtful that Barr would be able to.\n\nBut Han Sen had set this price to create a standard for the people who were watching him. If others heard the price and offered two thousand genes, then he wouldn\u2019t mind exerting a little effort to bless them in exchange.\n\nIf he had two thousand King xenogeneic genes, with the extra few that he received via hunting, he would have enough to raise three of his different areas to the ninth tier.\n\n\u201cHe is crazy. Two thousand King genes. Can his blessing really bring people up to the rank of deified?\u201d a Demon mocked, upon hearing this news.\n\nOther people who had heard Han Sen\u2019s conversation with Barr thought the same thing. None of them could believe that Han Sen could simply make another person deified. They thought something special must have happened to Lando at the same time, or maybe some sort of special treasure was used. Perhaps he made use of some unknown force in that part of the universe. It couldn\u2019t have been Han Sen\u2019s power alone that gave Lando the final push.\n\nOf course, they accepted the fact that Han Sen\u2019s power had some sort of effect. But they didn\u2019t think it was the sole reason that Lando had become deified.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand King class xenogeneic genes? That\u2019s some easy money. I\u2019d bless someone for a thousand,\u201d a half-deified Feather grumbled to himself, dripping with disdain.\n\nWhen the Fourth Uncle of the Extreme King Meng Lie heard this, he frowned. The Sixth Uncle spoke up, saying, \u201cThis Han Sen is too greedy. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes? Not even deified people like you and I can get that many.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he can really make someone deified, two thousand King class genes is nothing,\u201d Meng Lie replied.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? If this works, then why must we go to all the trouble of practicing? Why don\u2019t we all just go queue and await his blessing?\u201d Uncle Sixth asked with a look of scorn.\n\nNo one believed Barr would deliver Han Sen two thousand King xenogeneic genes for a blessing. Not even Han Sen himself believed something like that would happen.\n\nA few Demons flew some distance away from Han Sen and shouted, \u201cHan Sen, two thousand King class xenogeneic genes is too expensive. Can we haggle? We can pay one thousand King xenogeneic genes for you to bless Mr. Ji.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but if you want to free him, you need to pay me five hundred King class xenogeneic genes,\u201d Han Sen said while pointing at Ji Yang Sheng.\n\nJi Yang Sheng was happy to hear this. He wanted the other Demons to pay the xenogeneic gene ransom so he would never have to pull a rickshaw ever again.\n\n\u201cWhat about the blessing?\u201d the negotiating Demon asked with confusion.\n\n\u201cFive hundred to be freed. Two thousand for a blessing. No discounts,\u201d Han Sen said simply.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s too expensive! We cannot bring you that many xenogeneic genes\u2026\u201d the Demon said with hesitation.\n\n\u201cWhen I said two thousand, I was giving you a fifty percent discount. In the future, it won\u2019t be this cheap,\u201d Han Sen warned.\n\nThe Demon King, when he heard Han Sen, understood that the price wouldn\u2019t go lower.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a blessing. Just let me leave!\u201d Ji Yang Sheng quickly said. He didn\u2019t think Han Sen\u2019s blessing was going to make him deified, anyway. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was practically daylight robbery.\n\nThe negotiating Demons spoke for a while more, and they eventually forked over five hundred King class xenogeneic genes for Ji Yang Sheng\u2019s freedom.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to bless you? Two thousand is a small sum. If you miss this chance now, it won\u2019t be any cheaper for you later on.\u201d Han Sen smiled at Ji Yang Sheng.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to pay you two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for your blessings,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng spat. Then he turned around to leave. He didn\u2019t want to see Han Sen ever again.\n\nHan Sen leered at the pile of King class xenogeneic genes that the Demons had just given him. He thought this was a fine business venture. If he couldn\u2019t get any more King class xenogeneic genes for blessings, he could always bargain with the Extreme King using Bai Wuchang. If he sold the prince back to the Extreme King, it would be for a fine ransom.\n\nBut he thought the Extreme King wouldn\u2019t be as fast to pay up as the Demon. The Extreme King were one of the top three races in the geno universe. They had to maintain their reputation, so there was a chance they wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay a ransom for the safety of their people.\n\nThere was no one pulling the rickshaw anymore, so Han Sen returned it to Destiny\u2019s Tower. Its origin was in the Alliance. He flew forward with Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.\n\nGu Qingcheng could fly atop her sword, while Elysian Moon used her umbrella to float. It looked very beautiful. Han Sen had to fly on his own. He had weapons, but he thought it wouldn\u2019t look as cool if he flew atop a rocket launcher or a sniper rifle. So, he gave up on that idea and flew on his own.\n\nAfter flying for half a day without seeing a single core xenogeneic, he suddenly saw something flying crazily through space after him. He had a closer look and noticed it was Barr.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, I have prepared two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for you. When can you start blessing me?\u201d Barr shouted, getting to the point immediately.\n\n\u201cYou really want me to bless you?\u201d Han Sen looked at Barr with shock.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, why would I come looking for you? When can you begin?\u201d Barr looked impatient.\n\n\u201cPay me first, and then I will bless you. When the two thousand King xenogeneic genes have arrived, I will begin the process.\u201d Han Sen paused and then went on to say, \u201cBut the blessing is just a blessing. I can\u2019t guarantee that you will become deified. It all depends on the potential of your genes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, as long as there is a chance. You wait here, and I will go get the xenogeneic genes,\u201d Barr said, and then he left the core area. When he returned, he was lugging a mountain of King class xenogeneic genes behind him.\n\nMany King class people were watching Han Sen. They froze when they saw that mountain of King class xenogeneic genes. The news of Barr delivering two thousand King class xenogeneic genes to Han Sen in exchange for a blessing spread across the entire universe.\n\n\u201cIs Barr crazy? Two thousand King class xenogeneic genes for Han Sen\u2019s blessing? Isn\u2019t that a big waste?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way Barr had that many King class xenogeneic genes. This must have been given to him by the boss of the Destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Destroyed really want a deified, don\u2019t they? They are willing to pay so many King class xenogeneic genes for this ridiculous ceremony?\u201d\n\nMany King class people came close to watch. They wanted to see how Barr\u2019s blessing turned out. Many people had their filming equipment at the ready. They streamed the images back to their people."
