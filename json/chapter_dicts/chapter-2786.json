They raised their heads to stare uncertainly at the mysterious Geno Hall. No one had any idea why it had shown up.\n\n\u201cThe Geno Being Scroll fights finished up not too long ago. Why is the Geno Hall appearing again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet some elite triggered the door for another lantern fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Last time, when Kong Fei fought, there was a different feeling permeating the atmosphere. This feels like something else entirely. Back then, all the stars arose. But now, it looks like there is a wound in the universe itself. It feels different from the way it felt before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, what is going on with the green crack? This is incredibly strange. I have never heard of something like this before. Seeing the green crack, I feel kind of sad. I want to cry. What is going on?\u201d\n\nOn the peak of Empty Mountain, there was a woman with a holy horn rising from her head. She was standing next to a beast with green fur. They were looking out across the universe\u2019s green crack. Their gazes were oddly intense.\n\n\u201cIt has finally appeared again. It has been a billion years since I was last able to witness the sadness of a god. I miss the era of Mountain Leader, the man who could go against the sky and kill gods, break the doors, and mark his place. He became a god spirit. It has been a billion years since someone did something like this. Today, I am able to witness god\u2019s sadness once more,\u201d the green-haired beast said. He looked at the sight, an oddly conflicted expression on his face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who could go against the sky and slay a god right now, though. And even claim their god spirit seat.\u201d The horned woman frowned.\n\n\u201cThis is a good thing no matter who has done it. It proves that the Geno Hall\u2019s suppression is not infallible. Those gods are no longer omnipotent opponents. We can slay them and take their thrones,\u201d the green-haired beast said. It looked at the sleeping gold beast and said, \u201cThis might be Empty Mountain\u2019s chance. With Little Mountain Leader here, nothing can prevent Empty Mountain from rising.\u201d\n\nHearing the three words \u201cLittle Mountain Leader,\u201d the woman\u2019s serious face showed a rare smile. \u201cThe blood of the Little Mountain Leader isn\u2019t pure, so its potential is unpredictable, but it can certainly become a true god. And then, it will be able to go against the sky and become something even greater. It will go into the Geno Hall as Mountain Leader did. People will then know that Empty Mountain is still here, and the race is composed of invincible blood.\u201d\n\nInside a scary red dwarf, there was a hidden palace. Within that palace, there were many creatures that looked like humans. They were staring at the god\u2019s sadness in space.\n\nIf Han Sen had been there, he would have been shocked to find God\u2019s Retribution amongst them. He was a member of Blood Legion.\n\n\u201cWhat we knew would happen has finally come to pass. For the first time since Sacred, a war of gods has finally started anew. It is a shame that we haven\u2019t sufficiently prepared yet.\u201d A man with blue eyes stared at the sky and sighed.\n\n\u201cAlthough we aren\u2019t yet prepared, it isn\u2019t as if we don\u2019t stand a chance. Blood Legion has remained hidden for too long. It is time to fight the god spirits in the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d The blue-eyed man looked at the green crack in the distance. No one could tell what he was thinking.\n\nOn a small planet that belonged to the Thousand Treasures, an old man who was holding a cloth flag frowned and looked up at the green crack in space. He spoke to himself, saying, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening. Time isn\u2019t yet up. The Geno Hall\u2019s bindings should still be in place. Was someone able to kill a god right now? Weird\u2026 That shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d\n\nOn countless mysterious places in the universe, scary elites stared at the green crack and the Geno Hall that was slowly appearing. All of them were thinking about different things. Some were very excited. Some were suspicious. Some of them were only watching. They were watching in the hopes of finding out who had managed to kill a god spirit and take the god spirit\u2019s place.\n\nThe Geno Hall had completely revealed itself now. The whole universe went pitch black, and only the green light shone in space with its beautiful vacillations.\n\nThe door of the ancient, mysterious Geno Hall looked like it hadn\u2019t been opened for a billion years. Today, it was finally opened again.\n\nThis was different from Kong Fei\u2019s lantern fight. And it was different from Ancient Water God\u2019s fight to break through the door. This Geno Hall\u2019s door was completely open. Any creature from any corner of the universe could see what was inside the door now.\n\nInside the door was a giant statue that looked like it had been made from jade. Although it was just a statue, it was too intimidating to be described. The mere sight of it weighed on the mind like an anvil. When creatures with weaker minds looked at the statue, they found themselves kneeling before they even knew what had happened.\n\nBut right now, blood was trickling down from the statue\u2019s eyes. The sight filled everyone who saw it with sadness. It was intimidating, but it didn\u2019t feel as threatening as one might have expected.\n\nWith many creatures watching, that statue slowly came out of the Geno Hall. A webwork of cracks covered it.\n\nWhen the statue passed the threshold of the Geno Hall\u2019s door, it shattered into a countless number of pieces that scattered everywhere.\n\nThe sky shook as if a thunderstorm was rocking space itself. It was like the sky was crying over the death of a god spirit.\n\n\u201cWho will be the new god spirit?\u201d Sky Palace Leader squinted his eyes. He stared at the Geno Hall with its open door.\n\nA statue had departed the Geno Hall. There was an empty god slot up there now, and there was guaranteed to be a new master to claim the space. Sky Palace Leader wanted to know who, in that era, could go against the sky and slay a god.\n\nThe other people of Sky Palace felt the same way, too. They all stared at the Geno Hall door, and they waited for the elite who killed a god spirit to ascend to their rightful platform as a new god.\n\nBut after waiting for a long time, they still hadn\u2019t seen a new being fly toward the Geno Hall to claim their seat. A voice boomed from the Geno Hall, sounding clearly across the nothingness of space. \u201cSky Vine Radish has fallen. The god\u2019s personality is lost. Whoever has the personality of Sky Vine Radish can claim the god spirit\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nEvery person in the universe was shocked. A god spirit had fallen, and the god\u2019s personality had vanished. They had never heard of something like this happening before. The elite that killed Sky Vine Radish should have taken their god personality to the Geno Hall and become a god themselves.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean for a god\u2019s personality to be lost? Does it mean that the elite killed a god spirit and didn\u2019t take the god\u2019s personality?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way. Such a powerful thing. Why did he not take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the elite died alongside Sky Vine Radish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n\nThe hearts of many people were pounding in their chests. If the elite and the god really had died together, then anyone could find where the god died, claim the personality, and become a god themselves.\n\nAs people all across the universe found their minds racing, the door shut, and the Geno Hall returned to the nether. But the sadness in the sky still lingered like a green mark. It didn\u2019t fade."
