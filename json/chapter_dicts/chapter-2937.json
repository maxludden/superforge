If I tell you and you are not satisfied, what will happen then?\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s eyes looking shiny.\n\n\u201cIf it comes to that, we will resume our combat.\u201d Han Sen lifted his lips.\n\nNine Thousand King was scary, and he had a god personality armament. In this universe, he was a top-class elite.\n\nHe could not change his mind. He could not deny the fact he was a slave. He was not kind, and he was very stingy. He would not take any loss.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s personality was very suspicious. Seeing Han Sen so determined made him worry even more. He was not going to attack just yet.\n\nNine Thousand King thought, \u201cAlthough this Han Sen is only butterfly class, the treasure and geno arts of his body are very weird. He has a geno art that can make a true god level down. He hasn\u2019t used it yet. He looks so calm. Is he so confident he can destroy my Thousand Eye Battle Armor?\u201d\n\nIt had to be said that in the geno god list fights, Han Sen had become famous in the whole universe. Many antique elites were afraid of Han Sen\u2019s Xuan Yellow Sutra.\n\nNine Thousand King laughed weirdly and said, \u201cThis place is the leader\u2019s dear garden. It is bad to destroy it. Fine, I can answer these questions you have asked. If you still aren\u2019t going to behave after I tell you the secrets, you cannot take it out on me for attacking you.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard Nine Thousand King say that, he did not feel weird. He casually said, \u201cIf you are not going to answer me some random thing, I can give you the treasure inside.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen said that, he was actually thinking, \u201cThis holy garden is so weird. The meat we just ate re-appeared in the pot. The wine we drank is back in the bottle. That is so weird.\u201d\n\nIn fact, what shocked Han Sen the most was when he saw his deified genes. He noticed that after eating the meat in the pot, which filled up his deified genes, he was missing the six he required again. He returned to how he was before he ate the meat. That was not normal. If he could not figure out what was going on, Han Sen was not going to feel safe about it.\n\nPlus, there were other important questions. These were questions that had been on Han Sen\u2019s mind for a long time.\n\nNine Thousand King went silent a bit. He pointed at the stone pot and said, \u201cThis stone pot is the item Sacred Leader used to eat from. It is not some famous treasure, but it has a treasure that not even true god class elites have. If you put the flesh of a xenogeneic inside to cook, it can turn the xenogeneic genes into a sort of power we can absorb. It can make creatures evolve easier than if they were to consume a vat of geno fluid.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that?\u201d Han Sen looked at Nine Thousand King.\n\nNine Thousand King laughed and said, \u201cIt is just a dining apparatus. It is not bad for it to have that function. What makes it important is the meat in the pot. If I have seen it right, inside this pot is the flesh of one of the four holy beasts. It is Holy Kirin\u2019s xenogeneic genes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? That is the flesh of the Holy Kirin inside the pot?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He did not rightly believe the claim.\n\n\u201cYes, it is the Holy Kirin\u2019s flesh,\u201d Nine Thousand King confidently said.\n\n\u201cNo way. I have been to East Holy Kirin Garden. Holy Kirin\u2019s flesh is there in the garden, and the flesh of the Kirin is bad. How are you able to cook it?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He thought Nine Thousand King was trying to trick him.\n\nUpon hearing Han Sen say that the Holy Kirin\u2019s flesh was inside the East Holy Kirin Garden, Nine Thousand King was just as much shocked. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cI did not expect the Holy Kirin to survive the disaster, but don\u2019t worry. Listen to me, and you will know that I am not lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am listening,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nNine Thousand King looked at the pavilion statue, which looked like Wan\u2019er, and said, \u201cThis thing is related to your second question. It is related to the owner of the statue.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Who is this person depicted in the statue?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThe person in the statue is the leader\u2019s little sister,\u201d Nine Thousand King said. \u201cIn regard to her name, I do not know the answer to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it is Sacred Leader\u2019s sister, she must be someone special within the ranks of Sacred. How can you not know her name?\u201d Han Sen really didn\u2019t believe it.\n\nNine Thousand King sighed and said, \u201cThe leader really loved his little sister. Her body was always very weak. Sacred Leader was worried someone might hurt her, so he placed her in the holy garden to allow the death angel to protect her. Even the 10 generals of the four holy beasts were unable to gain access. No one really knew Sacred Leader had a little sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe leader was really nice to his little sister. No matter what she requested, even if it was the head of a god, she would get it. He would do anything to ensure a smile would adorn his sister\u2019s face. The only reason I know about her is because she snuck out of the holy garden. She happened to bump into me. She said she wanted to walk around, but then something happened. That is why I know her. Regarding her name, I did not dare ask her for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cWhat was her connection to the meat in the pot?\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King sighed and said, \u201cOur leader was very nice to this little sister, but she was sick. She could not live for long. Our king tried his best, but she could not keep on living. The time she snuck out of the holy garden, Sacred Leader immediately knew. He followed her and showed up when she passed out. He took her away and put her back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOur leader said it seemed like only the flesh of the Holy Kirin would extend her life, but even that was for only a few years.\u201d Nine Thousand King looked at the flesh that was bubbling in the stone pot. He went on to say, \u201cGod knows how many years have gone by, but ever since then, the meat has still been cooking. Meat that can be cooked inside a stone pot for so long must be something special. That is why I presumed it to be the flesh of the Holy Kirin.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen heard that, he thought, \u201cThat means Wan\u2019er really is Sacred Leader\u2019s little sister. If that is true, why did she end up in a tree hole? In the Sacred Era, her lifespan was almost all gone. She required the flesh of the Holy Kirin to extend her life by a few years. It has been billions of years since then. She is still alive. What is that all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThere is no more. I only saw her once. I never saw her after that. Ever since then, Sacred started to have many problems. Not many years later, there were many big changes. I was on a business trip for the leader, which is how I survived. As to what happened in Sacred, I have no idea.\u201d Nine Thousand King shook his head."
