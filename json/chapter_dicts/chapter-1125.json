Perhaps you met him at some point? It\u2019s a shame he is dead now, though. His name is Han Jinzhi; have you heard about him?\u201d Han Sen asked, coyly.\n\nUncle Bug gave a strange look at first, but then he smiled, saying, \u201cThat name eludes me, sorry!\u201d\n\nHan Sen wished to say something more, but Uncle Bug quickly waved his hand and said, \u201cI need to go to Redbug Lake now. We can talk later.\u201d\n\nWatching Uncle Bug leave, Han Sen knew he had caught the man off-guard. Uncle Bug was a little nervous in his response. Han Sen wished to find out what had happened in the past, but no one ever wished to talk about it. Not even Sunset could tell him.\n\nIt was incredibly unlikely but fortunate for him to have met Uncle Bug, and Han Sen was fond of the area around the shelter. He knew he couldn\u2019t push the old man too hard for information. Not yet, anyway.\n\n\u201cHow can I get Uncle Bug to reveal more?\u201d Han Sen wrestled with a number of different methods he could try, but none seemed viable.\n\nSo, he decided to find out more about who Uncle Bug actually was. People only knew him by the queer nickname, so he fancied trying to dig a little deeper beyond the name Uncle Bug.\n\nHan Sen even asked someone to compose an image of the man. With this portrait in hand, Han Sen perused Skynet to learn more about Uncle Bug\u2019s true identity. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t find a trace of the man.\n\nUncle Bug gave Han Sen an uneasy feeling in his stomach, and his mere presence was different than what Han Sen received off others.\n\nHan Sen concluded his investigation with lame results: nothing new was learned. He hadn\u2019t even found the man\u2019s real name.\n\nHan Sen asked the elders in the shelter, who looked to be close with Uncle Bug, but learned nothing from them, either. They spoke a lot, but didn\u2019t actually say much, so to speak.\n\nHan Sen now knew there was something off about the man, but he wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d get him to talk.\n\nUncle Bug continued to pretend he didn\u2019t know anything, upon future inquiries. It was rather frustrating for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra could not follow every train of thought or scan through the mind of a person as if it were an archive. Had he been able to do this, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have gone to such lengths to find out info elsewhere.\n\nBut he knew he had to be careful and not scare Uncle Bug off. If he was too pushy, things could turn ill. What\u2019s more, if Han Sen ever left this shelter, he wouldn\u2019t know where to find him back in the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen decided to drop the investigation for now and resume his previous plan of heading for the strange valley he had been told about. He went there with Bao\u2019er.\n\nFinding a super creature in The Forest of a Thousand Insects was a very difficult affair, as the knotted realm was rather tame compared to other regions if one did not venture too far.\n\nHan Sen went to the deserted area and saw the three hills, which acted as a crude border-wall separating The Forest of a Thousand Insects and Thorn Forest.\n\nThe hills were not too tall, and they stood at a height of around five hundred meters. They were quite plain and barren.\n\nHan Sen flew into the sky to get an aerial view of the space. As he had been told, there was a Y-shaped valley devoid of any visible life. It was like a dead canyon, cloaked in white sand.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t believe it was entirely empty, however. Giving the place a scan, his suspicions were confirmed. He found something. In that valley were numerous holes. They were all the size of a fist, roughly, and looked like little tunnels that belonged to a nest.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s dongxuan aura could not see through the thick walls, unfortunately, so he could not get a proper scan of what might lay inside. He did hear a noise, though.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t entirely sure what the noise was, but he acknowledged it wasn\u2019t too dissimilar to the crying of a baby.\n\nUncle Bug had told him about the noise, but Han Sen was still surprised to hear it just as he said. And he could hear it from quite a distance away, too.\n\n\u201cWhatever creature is making that sound, it seems as if it resides beneath here. I\u2019ll have to draw it out somehow.\u201d Han Sen had an idea of how to do just that. So, he returned to the forest and caught two tank bugs.\n\nHan Sen cut each of them up and tossed them into the valley.\n\nThe two tank bugs had not been killed, they had just been badly injured. They squirmed around in agony, trying to escape the place, as blood squirted everywhere.\n\nWatching the bugs leave the valley, another thought cropped into Han Sen\u2019s head, \u201cAre those creatures not interested in the tank bugs?\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen thought about this, the tank bugs were successfully making their escape. Or so it seemed.\n\nThe tank bugs were only ten meters away from the exit. But then, they just vanished. The trail of blood they had left in their wake stopped in the exact spot they disappeared from sight. Stranger still, it didn\u2019t look as if something had pulled them down into the sand.\n\nThe two bugs just vanished before Han Sen\u2019s eyes, with no warning or indication of where they had gone.\n\nHan Sen had already activated his dongxuan aura, so if something peculiar had happened, he should have noticed it.\n\nBut the two injured tank bugs suffered a fate that made no sense. Han Sen gritted his teeth and flew back into the forest again. He grabbed a few more bugs, wounded them, and tossed them into the valley.\n\nThis time, Han Sen focused on them intently. He wanted to watch where they went exactly.\n\nHe had tossed in ordinary and primitive class creatures, and they looked to be panicky and desperate. They urgently wished to escape the valley."
