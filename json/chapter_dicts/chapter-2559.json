Hang on a second. It will begin shortly. Let me just move these xenogeneic genes into storage first.\u201d Han Sen carted the xenogeneic genes into his core area hall, then placed them all inside Destiny\u2019s Tower. Then, he returned to the core area.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start now,\u201d Han Sen said as he walked in front of Barr. Then he asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you want me to bless you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t quite understand this. He knew that Barr had no lack of willpower, and it was strange that the man was so desperate for a blessing all of a sudden. With Barr\u2019s personality being what it was, it just seemed a bit out of character.\n\n\u201cThere is someone I wish to defeat. But if I\u2019m ever to accomplish that task, I\u2019m going to require a greater amount of power. I need that strength, and I need it now,\u201d Barr said with frightening certainty.\n\n\u201cWho is that\u2026 um, lucky person?\u201d Han Sen was going to say \u201cunlucky,\u201d but then switched it to \u201clucky.\u201d After all, Barr was a customer. Han Sen knew that being Barr\u2019s enemy was never a good thing, anyway. In this case, Han Sen thought it was funny. And as long as Barr wasn\u2019t bothering him, he didn\u2019t care who the unlucky sod was.\n\n\u201cDollar,\u201d Barr answered.\n\nHan Sen felt his eyes bulge upon hearing that. After half a day of waiting, it was revealed that he himself was the unlucky guy Barr harbored so much antipathy for.\n\n\u201cHm, interesting.\u201d Shaking off his momentary pause, Han Sen gave Barr an uneasy thumbs up.\n\nAfter everything that had happened, Han Sen couldn\u2019t back out now. He had already taken the goods, so he had no choice but to go through with things.\n\nBarr stood tall and straight like a tower, and Han Sen reluctantly reached out his hands. He placed them on Barr\u2019s forehead like a priest. He said, \u201cI\u2026 Han Sen\u2026 by the names of all the gods\u2026 grant you\u2026 Barr\u2026 an eternal holy power\u2026 opening Destiny\u2019s Door.\u201d\n\nHan Sen made himself sound like a god. The warm light he unleashed came from his hands. It became a deep red as it shined down and entered Barr\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen said this, but he was hoping that Barr failed to level up to become Deified. If this process was successful, then he had just made a new enemy for himself. An even more formidable one, at that.\n\nThere were many elites who were watching, both in the core area and the outside universe, and none of them blinked. They intently watched Han Sen hold Barr\u2019s forehead.\n\nBarr was taller than Han Sen, but as he stood before Han Sen right now, he looked like some apostle being initiated into monkhood. He closed his eyes and allowed the blood-like powers to enter his body.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel connected with Barr\u2019s self-cogwheel. When the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel moved, Barr\u2019s self-cogwheel started to move as well.\n\nHan Sen was able to see that Barr\u2019s self-cogwheel was black. It was black like metal. His cogwheel was laden with triangular black symbols. In the corners, there were faceless heads.\n\nThere was nothing distinguishing about the blank faces, but he could tell that one of them was feminine. He could identify another as being the face of a man. The third one, however, was different. Trying to discern it was nearly impossible. It was so blurry that a gender couldn\u2019t be accurately defined.\n\n\u201cDia Robber, do you think Han Sen can make Barr deified?\u201d A deified of the Destroyed, whose name was Arthur, asked Dia Robber.\n\n\u201cHe might not become deified, but I do believe that whatever happens will be a great boon for Barr,\u201d Dia Robber said.\n\nArthur frowned and said, \u201cDia Robber, you\u2019ve spoiled Barr. If you knew that Han Sen might not make him deified, why did you borrow him so many xenogeneic genes? If it wasn\u2019t for you, we would never have approved this trade.\u201d\n\nDia Robber bowed to Arthur and said, \u201cMr. Arthur, I lent out the King xenogeneic genes. It is only a matter of time before we see the sum returned. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nArthur shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you shouldn\u2019t spoil him. After all, he isn\u2019t a pure Destroyed.\u201d\n\nDia Robber laughed and said, \u201cBarr may be of impure blood, but he is very talented. Everyone knows that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis talents are excellent, but due to his blood, his chances of becoming deified are pretty low,\u201d Arthur said.\n\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m helping him. Han Sen might not make him deified, but this blessing should at least help reinforce his motley genes. Perhaps this is Barr\u2019s chance,\u201d Dia Robber said calmly.\n\n\u201cOld Four, what do you think will happen with this blessing?\u201d The Sixth Uncle was drinking tea as he watched the stream of Han Sen imparting his blessing upon Barr.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to tell,\u201d Meng Lie said quietly.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s hard to tell? Those two thousand King xenogeneic genes have likely just been squandered. And for what purpose? To level up a measly King. The Destroyed are way too hopeful, placing their faith in some silly myth surrounding that arrogant boy.\u201d The Sixth Uncle laughed.\n\nMeng Lie didn\u2019t say anything. He merely continued watching Barr be blessed.\n\nMany people were watching Barr. After Barr\u2019s self-cogwheel was pushed, it started to spin. The symbols on his self-cogwheel started to shine.\n\nBarr\u2019s body began to change in a bizarre way. Barr wasn\u2019t a pure Destroyed. He had three faces, but not three heads. Furthermore, they were all male. He didn\u2019t have six arms. At first glance, no one would believe he was considered one of the Destroyed.\n\nBut when his self-cogwheel started to spin, his three faces underwent strange changes. The face in the front started to disappear, and the left face started to become more masculine, whereas the right face appeared more feminine.\n\nThe left face looked very murderous. It was like the face of a demon from hell. The right face was very kind. It looked so nice, and its appearance was somewhat reminiscent of a Buddha.\n\nOnly the face in the middle had no defining features.\n\nBoom!\n\nAs this happened, drastic changes rippled through Barr\u2019s body. His muscles were like gas-filled balloons. They swelled to become ludicrously large, like he was some living caricature of strength. And in all honesty, that wasn\u2019t far from the truth.\n\nA scary Destroyed power oozed out of him like black lava. Inside that burning Destroyed power, Barr\u2019s body melted away. His flesh came off of him, revealing just his bones.\n\nThose bones were different from ordinary bones. They were black like steel, and their shape, composition, and arrangement seemed to resemble something of a human skeleton. The only real, significant difference was the head. The skull possessed three faces.\n\nThe left one looked demonic, whereas the right one looked like a Buddha. The middle one still didn\u2019t have any discerning features. It was a blank slate, expressionless and unreadable.\n\nFrightening black Destroyed powers began to sear the man\u2019s skeleton. Then, as countless elites watched, Barr\u2019s three faces began to scream.\n\nHis left face shrieked like a devil. His right face was chanting. The middle one with no mouth was making a silent scream.\n\nWith these three cries, Barr\u2019s Destroyed power exploded. His scary black bones were covered in energy. His Destroyed power burned like a black sun. This creature no longer bore any resemblance to the old Barr.\n\nThe dark Destroyed power began to get stronger. All of a sudden, a white dot appeared within the darkness. That white spot was like a sun, gleaming through the shadows. The black Destroyed power became white.\n\n\u201cNo way.\u201d The Sixth Uncle\u2019s eyes opened wide. In his sheer awe, he had forgotten all about his cup of tea. His attention was now fixated on the white dot of Destroyed power.\n\nThat white dot was small, but a deified like the Sixth Uncle could tell it was a substance chain. Only deifieds could possess substance chains."
