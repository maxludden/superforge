    "text": "Seeing Han Sen continue to walk forward, not slowing down for a single second, Liu Yuxuan was moving from afraid to terrified. It didn\u2019t help that Han Sen had remained silent the entire time, as well.\n\nMost people that found themselves being suddenly dragged away against their will by an angry man would object quite loudly, but Liu Yuxuan remained as quiet as he could. There was a risk he was trying to avoid, despite thinking Han Sen\u2019s bluff was still in play.\n\nLin He and Lin Weiwei could see the two from where they were, and they watched intently. They were still a little unsure about what had motivated and instigated Han Sen\u2019s aggression, but they knew there was more to this than met the eye.\n\nLiu Yuxuan\u2019s eyes were wide open now, having realized Han Sen had strolled directly into the area the beast was said to feast on intruders.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy! That\u2019s it, we have to go! We have to go now or else we die!\u201d Liu Yuxuan finally spoke, and his voice wasn\u2019t at normal volume. It was a scream, one driven by an intense fear of imminent death.\n\nHan Sen stopped, looked at the wriggling worm, and said, \u201cWhy would we die? I thought you said this is a safe road, and that our exit from the mountain is just beyond here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it! Just do it! Get out! Leave this place!\u201d Liu Yuxuan was writhing around with what looked like a broken mind. He really didn\u2019t want to die, and he was utterly terrified of the concept of waking up the super creature that was said to live there.\n\n\u201cLeave? Leave here? Give me one good reason to.\u201d Han Sen was slowly starting to walk forward again.\n\n\u201cYou are crazy! It\u2019s a dead end, not an exit! And only death will await us both if you continue going forward!\u201d Even the deaf could have heard Liu Yuxuan\u2019s hopeless crying, and so pretty swiftly, his scheme was revealed to the party that watched from afar. If it wasn\u2019t for Han Sen, they all would have merrily walked into a trap, still thinking Liu Yuxuan was a decent fellow.\n\nHan Sen turned around and dragged him back to Lin He. Then, he threw him onto the ground.\n\n\u201c*sshole! Why do you want to hurt us?!\u201d Chen Hu was furious at this revelation.\n\n\u201cRun! Run!\u201d Liu Yuxuan believed the creature must have woken up by now.\n\n\u201cIt would be best we stay away from this area for now. Come, let\u2019s backtrack a bit,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nLin He agreed, saying, \u201cYes, Chen Hu, everyone, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nBut suddenly, the sound of a wicked scream and an explosion was heard from far behind them.\n\n\u201cWe are dead because of you!\u201d Liu Yuxuan yelled at Han Sen, as if he was a victim.\n\nHan Sen frowned at the emergence of a new threat, but he was not afraid.\n\nThe sound was loud, and the noise of something hissing was quickly drawing near. A white snake came into view.\n\nIt was like a cross between a white cobra and a dragon. The head possessed a unicorn horn, and ice-like eyes. The scales of its form were like threaded diamonds. The monster was as beautiful as it was scary.\n\nNobody\u2019s legs could move, though, and it felt as if something was keeping them from fleeing.\n\nThe creature was infinitely more frightening than the Blood-Wing Beast King they had previously encountered. In the presence of that monster, they could not even think about running.\n\nEven Lin He felt his body stiffen, and all he could do was remain still, watching the snake approach.\n\nThe snake looked at the crowd and hissed. Its forked tongue rattled in the open maw. As everyone looked on, they were sapped of their hope of survival.\n\nLiu Yuxuan looked as if he belonged in an asylum. He was crazy, mumbling and dribbling in fear. He repeatedly blubbered, \u201cThat\u2019s it, man. Game over, man. Game over!\u201d\n\nIn the next second, the white dragon moved in front of Han Sen. Everyone thought he would be the first to go, regretfully.\n\nThe snake pulled out its tongue and touched his body.\n\nHan Sen was able to move the entire time, but he had chosen not to. He knew the beautiful white snake was not actually going to be hostile at all.\n\nHe had, of course, at first prepared to fight. But as the snake drew nearer and nearer, he was able to realize there was no aggressive intent in its approach.\n\nAmidst everyone\u2019s mounting shock, a white mushroom fell out of the snake\u2019s mouth and into Han Sen\u2019s hands. Then, the snake lowered its head in front of him.\n\n\u201cIs this for me?\u201d Han Sen looked at the mushroom with confusion.\n\nThe mushroom was very big, and the lifeforce it possessed was no joke. It was incredibly strong. Simply smelling it was enough to bring a person\u2019s mind great comfort, and it looked so delicious, Han Sen thought he could hear his cells moaning and groaning for a taste.\n\nIt was lucky the super creatures had no intention of harming him, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t yet understand why that was. And stranger yet, why were they delivering him gifts?\n\nHaving also received the blood fruit earlier, he now thought to himself, \u201cDoes Lady Luck simply have a crush on me? Is this her work?\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan was frozen for a different reason now. He watched what occurred with immeasurable shock. He exclaimed, \u201cImpossible! Dragon Saliva! Impossible!\u201d\n\nEveryone looked at Han Sen strangely. They now knew for sure that the Blood-Wing Beast King really had only cared for Han Sen.\n\nSuddenly, though, the white snake grabbed Han Sen. They believed it was going to eat him for a second, but that spike of fear was quickly alleviated. It had only grabbed Han Sen by his clothes, and gently, it placed him on its back. It had decided to guide him through the next region of the mountain.\n\nSeeing Han Sen atop the white snake, Liu Yuxuan\u2019s broken mind seemed to completely shatter. He muttered, \u201cThis must be a nightmare. I have to wake up! This must really be just a bad dream.\u201d"
