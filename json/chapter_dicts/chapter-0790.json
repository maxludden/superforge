    "text": "Although Han Sen was unable to trace the path of the Falsified-Sky power, it was cast by a human. That meant Han Sen could tell exactly when Luo Yin cast the move.\n\nWith this knowledge, Han Sen should be able to fight in a way that would prevent his opponent from casting any Falsified-Sky powers. No matter how powerful a skill was, it was pointless if it could not be used.\n\nBut this was just a thought. He couldn't blindly go against something like that and expect things to turn out exactly as he envisioned. He knew he'd have to deliberate it more and work out exactly how he might break down those attacks.\n\nHan Sen was not an old-fashioned man. He had doubts, so he didn't venture to the Emerald Lake as planned. Instead, he returned to a human shelter so he could go back to the Alliance.\n\nUpon his return, he wanted to research and learn as much as he could about the Falsified-Sky Sutra. He didn't plan on learning it, but Han Sen would definitely value a way in which he might break it, if it was ever used against him again.\n\nThe Luo family would never expect the Falsified-Sky Sutra they gave Han Sen to go unlearned, and he would instead use it to reverse-engineer a counter to the very thing they desired him to know.\n\nAfter glossing over a bunch of information, Han Sen stumbled onto something rather elucidating.\n\n\"The power is of the sky but not; it is shura. Power is drawn from blackened hearts.\" After reading this sentence, Han Sen sort of understood what it meant. The Falsified-Sky power was derived from the shura, obtained through the consequence of evil actions.\n\nYou cannot avoid karma. Once you strike, it is locked-on and unavoidable.\n\nIf it really was karma, then no one could avoid it. But this Falsified-Sky Sutra was created by humans. The karma they created was just a power built by the hands of humans.\n\nAfter Han Sen saw this, his mood began to ease.\n\nThe power of humans could always be exhausted; they could not go on forever. So, the Falsified-Sky Sutra that never missed had to suffer from the same human defect.\n\n\"If things are like this, then the Dongxuan Sutra should be a Falsified-Sky Sutra-buster. Dongxuan is all about seeing opportunities. You can observe people, the sky and ground. You can see through everything in this world. My dongxuan aura should be able to trace the coming of Falsified-Sky power. So, why am I unable to?\" Han Sen had yet to come up with a solution to this puzzle.\n\nHan Sen brought out his Dongxuan Sutra and gave it a read. There was still much content he did not understand. The lexicon of its writing was too ancient and old.\n\nIt had been a long time since he last tried reading it, but now here he was again with it. He compared it with the Falsified-Sky Sutra, for his knowledge of the Dongxuan Sutra had greatly expanded by now.\n\n\"So, Dongxuan Sutra can restrict Falsified-Sky Sutra? My dongxuan aura should be able to see and predict the path Falsified-Sky powers take. But it looks like I lost my way when learning the Dongxuan Sutra, and I focused too much on observing energies. Energy is only one component of everything in this world, after all.\" Han Sen felt as if he was learning more, the more he read. And the more he read, the more he realized just how incredible the Dongxuan Sutra really was. The contents would undoubtedly shock the world and bring God himself to tears. Still, there were many things he was unable to learn to completion.\n\n\"It shouldn't be too difficult to break the Falsified-Sky power. I need to sense destiny and predict karma. Then, it all boils down to which combatant is more powerful.\" Han Sen closed his Dongxuan Sutra with a far greater understanding.\n\nHan Sen didn't choose to immediately change his dongxuan aura. He started to review Jadeskin, which he had learned before it. After unlocking his first gene lock with Jadeskin, his eighth sense was what would enable him to restrict the Falsified-Sky power the most.\n\nIf he mastered his eighth sense, with the power of space and time, and his super sense ability, he wagered he could catch the Falsified-Sky power's trace.\n\nBut Han Sen was already used to dongxuan aura, which was similar enough. He rarely made use of his eighth sense, as it was. But now that he had read the Dongxuan Sutra again, he had learnt something new. He thought the dongxuan aura could include the eighth sense. So, he took a look at its specifics again, and got to thinking of a way he could incorporate it directly into dongxuan aura. And if he could not do that, he'd at least want to find a way in which he could use both simultaneously.\n\nBut the Dongxuan Sutra was the real and complete one. He had just been too focused on energy patterns and flows before. He had obtained many advantages from that, yes, but it resulted in him losing the true meaning behind dongxuan aura.\n\nHan Sen did not go back to the sanctuary for a while. He remained where he was, practicing the Dongxuan Sutra and Jadeskin, hoping for a breakthrough.\n\nHe thought the Luo family's business was too complicated. Even though his mom tried her hardest to get away from them, they'd always crop up in an unexpected manner. Han Sen began to think he might not be able to completely escape them, either. If there was some conflict with the Luo family in the future, this would be his best shot of coming out on top.\n\nIf he didn't learn how to overcome the Falsified-Sky Sutra, even if he learnt it himself, he would be unable to compete with the Luo family.\n\nThe Dongxuan Sutra, which could predict and foresee every opportunity, was his best chance of staying alive if he ever had to do combat with someone with a high-tier of the Falsified-Sky Sutra.\n\nTherefore, Han Sen got to practicing seriously once more. Unfortunately for him, however, progress was excruciatingly slow. So, Han Sen decided to visit the virtual training camp so he could do battle with real people. He would learn much faster through actual combat.\n\nQin Xuan visited the virtual training camp whenever she could, too. She always did so in the hopes of meeting up with A Little Soldier on the Battleship for some guidance. But it had been a long time since she last saw him, and this severely disappointed her.\n\nSo, on this day, she entered the virtual training camp and went straight to her friend list like usual. Much to her surprise, she saw A Little Soldier on the Battleship was online.\n\n\"Coach, are you free?\" Qin Xuan quickly sent a message and invited him to her lobby.\n\nHan Sen saw Ms. Perfume's invitation arrive and agreed to join. He knew Ms. Perfume was Qin Xuan, but Qin Xuan didn't know Han Sen was A Little Soldier on the Battleship. Therefore, he exercised much caution in not allowing her to see who he truly was.\n\nQin Xuan was quite powerful among evolvers, but because of Han Sen's fitness, she was far weaker than him now.\n\nBut not everything came down to fitness. The hyper geno arts and combat skills she possessed would do well for his practice. That was why he agreed to join her.\n\n\"Use all you can to beat me,\" Han Sen said to Qin Xuan after entering the arena.\n\nQin Xuan was happy to hear this and even happier to oblige. She thought the reason why he said this was so he could test her power and correct any mistakes she made.\n\nTo have such a powerful elite practice with her was a brilliant thing."
