    "text": "Han Sen\u2019s body was flashing in the air. When he struck the giant egg, Captain Wood was completely shocked.\n\n\u201cA speed like that, and a knifemind like that\u2026 How\u2026 Is his Teeth knifemind as good as the Queen\u2019s? What is this\u2026? Isn\u2019t he just a Baron?\u201d\n\nGhost Teeth Knife came against the giant egg, making it swing in the air like a tumbler.\n\nHan Sen could feel the life inside it. Ghost Teeth and Han Sen\u2019s knifemind had definitely damaged whatever creature resided inside. It had been a hearty blow to whatever was within.\n\nAfter the egg was injured, the gold fire it used took on the shape of a fiery bird. It chased after Han Sen wildly, but Han Sen still had his Teeth Rabbit shoes. He could still move much faster than that fiery bird, and it couldn\u2019t even singe him.\n\nSuddenly, though, a gold flame rose in the air like a blooming flower. The gold fire started to peel, as a handsome man revealed himself from the flickering lights. The man looked holy, like a god of some sort.\n\n\u201cHan Sen; killing the Raven will not benefit you. If you let him go, I can promise you three things,\u201d the godlike man in the air quietly told Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIs this Skygod\u2019s true form?\u201d Captain Wood was shocked again. He didn\u2019t think Skygod could leave the purple-bronze hall. He hadn\u2019t expected the elusive figure to show up outside the hall, and in another form as well.\n\nHan Sen ignored the golden man, though. He still thrashed the egg, making it rumble and rock even more.\n\n\u201cI can erase the marks you all possess, and performing three services,\u201d the man that was clad in gold clothes went on to\n\nHan Sen kept on hitting the egg, though. Eventually, there was a noise, and it prompted the egg to fall down and hit the ground.\n\nHan Sen jumped down next to it, with his Ghost Teeth Knife rampaging like a beast. It kept on hitting the egg, until a strange noise started to sound from inside it. It was like the sound of something crying.\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d The gold-clothed man\u2019s face changed now, and he gave the command coldly.\n\nGolden fire rained down like water, covering the world. The gold-clothed man was in the air, staring down at Han Sen, asserting himself like some sort of deity. And then, he said, \u201cI broke my own rules today, by letting you leave with your life. You figured out that I am just a being who uses illusions.\u201d\n\nAfter the voice, the gold flame turned the palace into a realm of lava. The gold fire became a monstrous entity, as dragons formed of fire stormed through the air around them. It was like the whole world was on that man\u2019s side.\n\nWith that display of power, Wood Duke wanted to immediately kowtow to the gold man. Han Sen stood defiantly, though, ignoring him. He kept on slashing the egg, making the crying sound sing even louder. The egg was beginning to get webbed with cracks.\n\nThe gold-clothed man was furious at this point, and the dragon and fire-beasts heard his rage. They raced down towards Han Sen, igniting the atmosphere with all sorts of fire.\n\nHan Sen was like an ant before a flood. It seemed as if those monstrous fires would have no trouble in destroying him.\n\nA lot of those fiery beasts roared at Han Sen, with tongues of flame lashing the air. They almost managed to get Han Sen. But instead, they hit the ground and made the earth itself melt.\n\nHan Sen still showed no concern with them, and he kept on striking the egg. The egg made even more noise now, and even more cracks began to show across its form.\n\nCaptain Wood and Black Steel were utterly gobsmacked as they witnessed all this. It was difficult to believe Han Sen was able to withstand the madness around him and continue attacking the egg. A Duke like Captain Wood would have been a shivering mess on the floor if he was faced with such outstanding pressure.\n\n\u201cHow do I make you stop?\u201d The godly-looking man\u2019s eyes burned with fire. His face was completely twisted.\n\nThe answer he received was delivered by the Ghost Teeth Knife, though. Han Sen was acting as if he was completely oblivious to everything except his enemy. Clutching the knife tight, he kept wailing against the egg.\n\nEventually, the black egg could not withstand the might, and it cracked deeply. A lava-like juice began to seep from the crevice.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, if you hit this thing one more time, I will make your entire race suffer!\u201d the gold-robed man bellowed. Katcha!\n\nAgain, it was only the knife and the sound of a breaking egg that answered him.\n\nThe egg was suffering with even more cracks now. The purple mist of the blade came against the egg as a golden juice started to flow out like blood.\n\n\u201cI, King Jun, swear to god; I will reduce your entire race to their primitive days of sticks and stones. The entire intelligence of your race will be reduced to a level that will only allow you to eat meat,\u201d the gold-robed man spat.\n\nThe entire mountain began to rock and rumble, with the noise of what sounded like thunder. Clouds formed in the sky, and they swirled as they cast a rain of blood. It was like his vow had been answered.\n\nThere was a lot of thunder, like a lashing punishment from some great god. The rivers of blood that were forming, alongside the gold fires, made the mountain look like the result of an ensuing apocalypse.\n\nA bolt of lightning exploded right next to Han Sen. The fire beasts roared into his ears, but even so, Han Sen showed no care or concern. Without a single moment of hesitation, his grip on his knife remained firm.\n\nSlash after slash, Ghost Teeth Knife struck the egg like mad. The egg was covered in marks, and the flow of the lavalike blood increased. It was all over the place, along with the purple mist. It was pretty creepy.\n\nXie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and Little Silver had the mark on their heads. Little Angel back at base might have had it, too. And that godlike figure that called himself King Jun did not seem like the trustworthy sort. All the creatures that had made a wish with him had met a grizzly end.\n\nThe only way to erase the mark now, Han Sen figured, was to destroy the Raven egg. There wasn\u2019t any other way. Han Sen knew that King Jun God was limited by some sort of power, and that was why the powerful being could not fight him directly.\n\nStill, Han Sen believed that what he was doing now would yield the best results.\n\nThe dragon-shaped thunder exploded next to Han Sen.\n\nThe rain of blood soaked Han Sen.\n\nThe fiery beasts and King Jun\u2019s roars were like curses being chanted from the pits of hell.\n\nBut despite all that, nothing could stop Han Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife.\n\nKatcha!\n\nAn unknown number of slashes later, the egg cracked open, shattering into pieces. The lava-like juices cascaded out, flooding its proximity."
