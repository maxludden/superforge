Still, he had managed to push through and eliminate the three remaining birds.\n\nHan Sen felt great relief following the end of that fight. There was one thing he had learned from this ordeal, though. It was to never mess with Xie Qing King. If Han Sen ever had to fight him, he knew he wouldn\u2019t win; not even if he used his super king spirit mode.\n\nWhile they rested, Han Sen went to check on the bird Xie Qing King had punched away. It was actually still breathing, just barely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good at cleaning up people\u2019s messes.\u201d Han Sen approached the wounded bird with his Phoenix Sword.\n\nHe slashed its neck twenty times, and on the final strike, the spine was broken through and the entire head was severed.\n\n\u201cSuper Creature Three-Claw Gold Raven killed. Beast soul gained. Its flesh is inedible and there is no Life Geno Essence for retrieval.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was so delighted, he felt intoxicated. He even thought he was dreaming for a moment, learning he had received another beast soul.\n\nEven if he could not find or obtain the primary treasure of this strange realm for himself, all the trials he endured thus far had been worth it.\n\nHan Sen looked at Xie Qing King and thought to himself, \u201cHe\u2019s so nice. He\u2019d be even nicer if he helped me kill more.\u201d\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s wish was unlikely with Xie Qing King. The spirit enjoyed punching, and more often than not, his punches ended up messily exploding of their recipients.\n\n\u201cMy Emperor is so powerful! You are the greatest spirit in the sanctuary!\u201d Han Sen complimented Xie Qing King with surprising sincerity, swiftly returning to his side. While he did admire him a great deal, he was hoping the expression of such gratitude would convince the spirit to go a little easier in the next battle, and provide Han Sen with a few easy finisher-kills.\n\nBut as Han Sen complimented Xie Qing King, the spirit suddenly collapsed.\n\nHan Sen saw his wounds were oozing silver blood. Many of the wounds were deep enough to reveal the bones inside.\n\nXie Qing King was strong, that could not be denied. But he was a hulking titan that preferred to withstand hits and power through a battle; he wasn\u2019t one for dodging. Going up against those four birds in that way had been a reckless thing for him to do.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen was able to draw one of the ravens away. If his greed hadn\u2019t gotten the best of him, and Xie Qing King had to fight all of them himself, he might not have survived.\n\nSeeing Xie Qing King sitting on the floor, bleeding, Han Sen wondered if he should kill the spirit now while he had the chance. And while he may have indeed had the opportunity and capability to do so, he noticed that Xie Qing King\u2019s spirit stone was nowhere in the vicinity. Killing him now would just make him upset, and that would not be good.\n\nHan Sen ran over to Xie Qing King and used his holy light, saying, \u201cMy Emperor, are you okay?\u201d\n\nXie Qing King frowned and said, \u201cYour healing is useless for a body as marvelous as mine. Take me to the lake, if you want to see me healed.\u201d\n\nHan Sen already knew the ability was useless, though. After all, it was an ability he had learned in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary. He only used it to appear kinder, more faithful and appreciative.\n\nHan Sen then picked up Xie Qing King in his arms and took him over to the lake.\n\nHe hoped Xie Qing King could heal. If Holy-Sword Emperor showed up again, he would most certainly be back with a vengeance\u2014especially towards Han Sen.\n\nWith Xie Qing King there, though, Han Sen hoped the spirit could protect him and defeat Holy-Sword Emperor once and for all. But for that to happen, he\u2019d have to be healed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Holy-Sword Emperor knows about this place, though. Does he? Regardless, I just need to get this dude patched up,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBut just as Han Sen finished thinking, a shadow flickered over the gentle waters of the lake. It was Holy-Sword Emperor. Speak of the devil.\n\nHan Sen wanted to slap himself in the gob.\n\n\u201cHow dare you show yourself in front of me like this,\u201d Xie Qing King coldly said.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor merely smiled and said, \u201cI know you were born many years before I was, but you\u2019re not an emperor. Our powers are similar, I now realize. And now, with you being injured, you stand no chance. Give me the scroll you stole and I\u2019ll let you live. Either that, or I\u2019ll kill you and take it by force.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you just threaten me?\u201d Xie Qing King\u2019s eyes looked murderous, as his stare drilled into Holy-Sword Emperor.\n\n\u201cYes. And I\u2019ll act on my threat if you don\u2019t do as I have just told you.\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor returned his gaze. He had been hidden out of sight for quite some time, spying on him.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the spirits of today have changed; they do not acknowledge those who should be their superiors.\u201d Xie Qing King stood up, as lake water dripped from the cuts it was working to fix.\n\nXie Qing King had been grievously injured, but he still stood up straight and strong. He was a renowned fighter, someone whose strength and power had been greatly admired in the past. The way he stood now resembled the glory of his hey-day, and this struck fear into Holy-Sword Emperor and his smug face.\n\nInjured or not, people who possessed such power were always scary.\n\n\u201cFine. I won\u2019t kill you, in respect for who you once were. But that scroll was mine, and you stole it. Give it back to me and I\u2019ll walk away,\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor asked, with a softened tone of voice.\n\nXie Qing King stepped forward; his naked, dripping body that was covered in cuts was quite impressive to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThe scroll now belongs to me, fool. I\u2019ll kill you in a single punch, punk. Who do you think you are, talking trash to an OG like me?\u201d Xie Qing King spoke calmly, but the words were infused with a profound malevolence. It was frightening to hear him talk like that.\n\nThe silver blood in his body burned like veins of virgin, mithril ore. His entire body was suddenly set ablaze with silver fire. Seeing power that simmered like that would strike fear into a god."
