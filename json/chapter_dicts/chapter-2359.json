    "text": "As far as Han Sen knew, Bai Yi cleared Planet Water Zone a long time ago. Even Lan Haixin hadn\u2019t bothered sending out hunting parties. But now, Han Sen had met two King class xenogeneics in a row. Both were in the same vicinity, too. This posed a big problem.\n\nPulling out his Thunder God Spike, Han Sen went towards the King class electric eel.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t really care what change Planet Water Zone was experiencing right now. He was just going to kill any King class creatures he found. Getting King class genes was good for him.\n\nHe used his Original Water King Body, then unleashed his dragon area as well. Han Sen moved like a water dragon as he rushed toward the big electric eel. The Thunder God Spike flickered with scary silver lightning, and the sound of thunder rumbled along its path.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s King areas entangled the giant electric eel. The water restricted the eel\u2019s body, and the creature swam extremely slowly, as if it was moving through mud.\n\nWhile Han Sen rejoiced at the success of his attack, the electric eel suddenly loosed a crackling discharge of lightning. The lightning created a scary thunder area and merged with Han Sen\u2019s own area. The electricity shot through the water and into Han Sen. His hair instantly poofed straight out and began vibrating with the force of the current.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s electrified body bounced away. He came to a stop after arcing through the water for a long time. His tongue felt numb.\n\n\u201cA king area focused purely on attack is too scary. And that electricity has a strong paralytic effect. This is at least a sixth-tier area. This electric eel will be hard to deal with.\u201d Han Sen held still in an attempt to hide himself, but the electric eel was already rushing toward him. Its thunder area came with it, and streams of electric chains shot out of its mouth.\n\nHan Sen used his water skills to dodge the thunder area and the lightning chains. Fortunately, he still had the benefits of his water areas. He moved much faster in the water than the electric eel did. If not for his speed advantage, he would have already taken more hits. That would have been extremely painful\u2014even if his body could withstand it.\n\nAfter dodging out of the eel\u2019s immediate attack range, Han Sen summoned Spell\u2019s dual pistols and started firing. It wasn\u2019t the sea conch, so Han Sen didn\u2019t have to worry too much about its blocking abilities.\n\nWhen the bullets entered the thunder area, the eel reacted immediately. It spewed more of that lightning to destroy the incoming bullets.\n\nBut one or two of the bullets still managed to strike the eel\u2019s scales. Familiar symbols began to shine across the impacted scales, showing the results of Han Sen\u2019s Turtle skill.\n\nThe Turtle skill took effect, and after a few more shots landed, the electric eel was much slower. However, the lightning on its body was still incredibly strong, and the creature\u2019s thunder area covered the surrounding region, so Han Sen couldn\u2019t get close to the creature.\n\nPang!\n\nSpell became a sniper rifle, and Han Sen fired a bullet toward the electric eel. The bullet shattered the eel\u2019s scales and tore into its side. Purple Teeth power spread across the wound.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s techniques weren\u2019t King class yet, and his Original Water King Body only had a first-tier area. Taking down a King class xenogeneic with a sixth-tier area would be incredibly difficult.\n\nLuckily, the Turtle skill worked well against the eel. Because of that, the foe was unable to catch up to Han Sen. He led it to the seabed, firing continually at the creature. Teeth power continued to shred its wounds. As it lost more and more blood, the electric eel\u2019s area grew weaker.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic King hunted: Electric Dragon. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen watched the giant electric eel\u2019s body sink while the announcement played in his head.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame I didn\u2019t receive its beast soul. An electric beast soul would have been very powerful.\u201d Han Sen swam over to the electric eel\u2019s body and dug out its xenogeneic gene.\n\nHe summoned his Shadow Queen Bee and let it eat the big electric eel\u2019s body.\n\nShadow Queen Bee hadn\u2019t matured yet, and Han Sen was already a Duke. The Queen Bee wouldn\u2019t be useful to him at this point, but since he had the meat available, he might as well let her eat it. Otherwise, it would all be wasted.\n\nShadow Queen Bee crawled over the body and ate with difficulty. Han Sen swallowed the entire electrified bone that was the xenogeneic gene. He also used his Consume talent to refine it with haste.\n\nA numb feeling swept over Han Sen\u2019s body. It was like his cells were electrified, and they began to vibrate with energy.\n\n\u201cDuke gene\u2026 Duke gene\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen finished refining the electric bone, his Duke gene tally had reached eighty-four. He was close to having a hundred.\n\n\u201cIf I kill two more King class xenogeneics, I\u2019ll have maxed it out. And then, I can open The Story of Genes\u2019 first gene lock.\u201d As Han Sen was calculating, he heard a boom in the distance.\n\nSomething tore its way out of the little hole under the mountain, dramatically widening the opening. The blood kirin emerged from the swirls of debris and returned to its ordinary size.\n\nBlood dripped from the blood kirin\u2019s mouth, and grievous injuries marred its scales. It was in very bad condition.\n\nPatong!\n\nThe blood kirin made it back to Han Sen, then fell onto its stomach on the seafloor. It struggled to get up.\n\nWounds covered its legs, and one leg had been twisted ninety-degrees. Black blood oozed around the wound.\n\nThe black blood drifted into the water around the blood kirin\u2019s body, then turned into some sort of small black bugs. They latched on to the blood kirin and started nibbling on its wounds and scales.\n\nThe blood kirin was a cruel and violent beast, but now it was actually squealing.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. The blood kirin was a half-deified xenogeneic that was nearly peerless, and judging from the way it had been injured, it had encountered something other than the sea conch.\n\nThe blood kirin\u2019s blood continued to become bugs, and Han Sen couldn\u2019t determine what sort of power had been used against his companion.\n\nHan Sen was still holding the Thunder God Spike, and he poked it into the blood kirin\u2019s wound. The black bugs began to shriek as Han Sen electrified them, and after a minute, they all fell off the wound.\n\nThose bugs vanished, but the blood gushing from the blood kirin\u2019s wounds was turning into more black bugs. If that continued, the blood kirin\u2019s veins were going to run dry.\n\nHan Sen looked at the little bugs, and he realized they were actually small sea conches.\n\nHan Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to see what was going on with the blood kirin. Many small, black sea conches were squirming around inside the blood kirin. There were too many to count, and the sight of them made Han Sen feel sick. At the rate that the blood kirin\u2019s body was being devoured, it wouldn\u2019t be long until only its bones remained.\n\nHan Sen wondered how he might save the blood kirin, but then something else came crawling out of the hole that the blood kirin had expanded. The newcomer\u2019s body swelled back to normal size. It was that same, King class sea conch.\n\nBefore Han Sen could react, another sea conch emerged from the hole. This one was beautiful and full of color. Its shell was like a crystal, and its colors shifted and glowed like a rainbow.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw that beautiful sea conch, the color drained out of his face."
