How can you not have Teeth Knife?\u201d There was still a while to go before the next knife rain came, so Han Sen tried to talk to Black Steel.\n\nHearing Han Sen call him Little Black, his eye twitched. He held back the urge to cut Han Sen down and simply closed his eyes.\n\n\u201cI know you must be the playful sort. I bet you like hitting on girls or something, to have skipped the years that would have allowed you to learn Teeth Knife.\u201d Han Sen was curious. Teeth Knife was so strong, so why was it that Rocks Fall Duke had learned it, whereas Black Steel hadn\u2019t?\n\nBlack Steel\u2019s eyelids twitched. He stared at Han Sen and said, \u201cDo you think everyone is as lucky as you? Teeth Knife is a Rebate skill, but not many people have the ability to practice it. Only six people know it right now, and Queen is the only one that is capable of mastering it I want to learn from her, but she does not think I am capable of learning it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can go and find the other five,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nBlack Steel hummed and said, \u201cI want to learn from the best If I can\u2019t learn it from her, I won\u2019t accept it from anyone less. Queen recommended that I learn another skill, anyway, so I don\u2019t need Teeth Knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the skill you are learning, then?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBlack Steel coldly said, \u201cCut-Steel Knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds powerful. Is that the skill you were using?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide. He was looking quite shocked.\n\nBlack Steel saw Han Sen was only pretending to be shocked, so he could extract more information, and felt his own eyelids repeatedly flicker with a twitch. He stood up and focused on getting to the top of the mountain.\n\n\u201cLittle Black, where are you going?\u201d Han Sen asked as he followed.\n\n\u201cI have a death wish. If you are afraid of dying, then I recommend that you don\u2019t come any further. When the grave erupts, you\u2019ll be slaughtered,\u201d Black Steel said coldly. Then, he went ahead to reach the peak.\n\nHan Sen did not believe Black Steel was going to die, and he was quite happy to have finally met someone with a fine temper. He wasn\u2019t going to let him go off quite so easily.\n\nSo, Han Sen followed him up to the peak. It was like a real volcano there. When Han Sen looked down, it looked like a meatgrinder beneath him, with a sea of knives all lying together. They lined up like the layers of teeth within the maws of a monster. It was a scary sight to see.\n\nAt the bottom, there was a red juice. It was lava, presumably. The weapons appeared to be ticking out from the liquid.\n\n\u201cLittle Black, can we find a weapon amidst those? The weapons are all together, right? So, the good ones should be easier to find.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the Knife Grave.\n\nBlack Steel coldly said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t afraid of dying, you can certainly try.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought his life was more important. He wasn\u2019t familiar with this place, so it was best not to risk it all by trying to venture in.\n\nWhile Han Sen was thinking about this, Black Steel was actually climbing down already.\n\n\u201cLittle Black, why are you going down?\u201d Han Sen looked surprised.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of dying,\u201d Black Steel said simply. He was clutching a knife as he made his descent.\n\nHan Sen decided to follow. The knives were all crisscrossed, and the places you could grab onto were just the blades. It was like you were climbing a knife mountain.\n\nFortunately, those blades were fairly poor. They were like the ones that had just fallen in the first rain. And since the dull knives weren\u2019t currently falling out of the sky, they weren\u2019t really dangerous.\n\n\u201cLittle Black,\u201d Han Sen said, just as he felt the blades start to shake. The steel juice at the bottom was beginning to bubble and boil. It looked ready to fly upwards.\n\nBlack Steel gave Han Sen a signal to be quiet He stayed silent, and then the knives and the steel juice became calm.\n\nHan Sen tried to copy him and kept on climbing. It seemed like Black Steel had brought him here just to get him to shut up.\n\nThe lower they got, the sharper the knives became. They were surrounded by knives now, and if the knives started to move, Han Sen and Black Steel would be turned into pincushions.\n\nEven if the knives didn\u2019t move, Han Sen could imagine the fate that would await him if he slipped.\n\nBut Han Sen was not afraid, and neither was Black Steel. In reality, he had nothing to be afraid of. He could always fly for a short time, and here, that would be enough to get him to safety.\n\nAnd furthermore, he had the Taurus shield. There was no way that the blades of a Baron could harm it. Then again, if Han Sen used the shield, he wasn\u2019t sure if the knives would still want him.\n\nThey climbed down quietly, getting closer and closer to the steel juice. Black Steel had only decided to come here because Han Sen had asked so many questions. The curiosity of wondering if there were any knives being born also played a part.\n\nBut there had only been one rain, and the good knives wouldn\u2019t be revealed just yet. Han Sen wasn\u2019t too hopeful.\n\nWhen he looked at the seething steel juice, he saw a pitch-black horse knife resting halfway within the liquid. The air was insanely hot that close to the liquid steel, but the sight still gave Han Sen the chills. Han Sen was thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s a good knife.\u201d\n\nThe knife was inside the steel juice. Han Sen tried reaching for it, but he was short by two arm lengths.\n\nHe didn\u2019t dare to move suddenly. If he shifted his weight too much, it would undoubtedly make the knives move, and the grave might even erupt at a faster pace. Even if their bodies were built of steel, they would still be sliced and diced into dust.\n\nBlack Steel frowned. He thought the horse knife was a Viscount class weapon. If he got it now, it would help him reach the seventh round. It was difficult to find a weapon such as that before the seventh rain. That knife might even carry him all the way to the tenth round.\n\nIf he gave up now and waited until the eruption, the knife might end up at a random location several hundred miles away. It\u2019d be hard to find it.\n\nBut there was no way he could reach it Just as Black Steel was giving up, Han Sen came down next to him and got his attention, then grabbed his arm.\n\nBlack Steel understood what he meant Han Sen wanted to lift him and let him reach out for the knife."
