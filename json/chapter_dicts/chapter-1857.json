    "text": "Inside the broken egg, there was a featherless Raven. A deep wound crossed its body, oozing purple smoke.\n\nThe Raven\u2019s eyes were partly open, but little more than slits. It looked furious, but it appeared to be suffering inside the lava-like juice. And while it seemed to be unable to stand, it lurched forward with the speed of lightning. Quickly, it came toward Han Sen, seeking to bite him with a mouth wreathed in fire.\n\nGhost Teeth Knife looked so angry in return, with its purple mist. Han Sen did not have to activate it himself, as the blade moved for him. It was like a hungry demon, and it wanted nothing more than to kill.\n\nThe Raven had not fully developed yet. There were no feathers on its body, and it was grievously injured. There was blood caking most of its skin. The knife came at the Raven and cut it, leaving a lesion across its flesh.\n\nThe full-power of a King class Ghost Teeth Knife only left a scratch across it, though.\n\nHan Sen kept moving, swinging his blade at the Raven as he went. It was still small, and its eyes were only partially open. Its body was still naked, and its skin wasn\u2019t as firm and developed as it could be. But even so, the Raven was not afraid of the assault. After the attack, it looked at Han Sen with even anger.\n\nKing Jun had not said anything. He coldly looked at Han Sen with an expression of pure hatred and murder. It was scary to witness.\n\nEventually, the blood rain, thunder, and fire began to fade. The palace had been reduced to little more than a ruin.\n\nHan Sen slashed the bird again, delivering more and more wounds upon it. Gold-blood spilled out of it, and it was clear Han Sen would soon end up killing the Raven.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, if you kill it, you will never be rid of me.\u201d King Jun sounded calm when he spoke; so calm it was chilling. Katcha!\n\nWithout hesitation, Ghost Teeth Knife delivered a clean cut across the Raven\u2019s neck. The head was lopped right off.\n\nKing Jun did not say anything. He merely looked at Han Sen. Then, he disappeared. But the look he had given Han Sen was remarkable.\n\n\u201cDeified creature hunted: Baby Sun Raven. Sun Raven beast soul obtained. Deified Gene obtained.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard the announcement, he was thrilled with delight. When the Sun Raven was killed, the marks on the foreheads of the others began to disappear, too. They became gold, and then melted into their flesh with the rippling mirage of a fire.\n\nGu Qingcheng sat down on the ground and used her Qi Gong to absorb the flame.\n\nXie Qing King\u2019s body, meanwhile, was glowing with silver light. Little Silver\u2019s eyes flickered with lightning.\n\nThe Barons at the base used their skills to absorb the mark, but the women and children were unable to. The gold blended into their skin and changed their bodies instead.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe mountain continued to shake. It came from the purple-bronze hall. It seemed to have erupted, and the palace came flying at them through the air.\n\n\u201cHan Sen? I will be back! Soon\u2026 soon\u2026\u201d King Jun\u2019s voice echoed through the underbelly of the mountain until the palace disappeared.\n\nCaptain Wood wanted to get up, but he had been badly burned. His flesh and even his bones had been charred. It didn\u2019t seem likely that he\u2019d live.\n\n\u201cSir, take my body back to Planet Green, if it is of no trouble for you. That is where I was born, and if I am buried there,\n\nI know it will make for a fine resting place,\u201d Wood said.\n\n\u201cWood, you raised me up. You have helped me a lot. Without you, I would have been killed by those gold fires. I cannot let you die,\u201d Black Steel said as he tried to pick up Captain Wood. \u201cHan Sen, I am going to take him home to heal. I am going now.\u201d\n\nBut Han Sen stopped him and said, \u201cWith the condition he is in, he won\u2019t even reach the base. He won\u2019t reach another planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing else I can do. I have to do this!\u201d Black Steel said.\n\nHan Sen thought for a moment, and then said, \u201cWait. There is a better chance of him surviving right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung Master, it is fine. I know what will happen to me. I will be happy enough if you can take my lifeless body to Planet Green.\u201d Wood was surprisingly calm.\n\nBlack Steel asked Han Sen, \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis body was burned by fire, and his body is suffering from fire poisoning. That is bad. He can\u2019t make it to camp. But these lotuses have a cold element within them. If they can suppress the Raven mark, it will help the fire and perhaps eliminate the fire poisoning,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThe lotuses might be able to clear the fire poisoning, but the wounds\u2026\u201d Black Steel shook his head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll need him,\u201d Han Sen said, then whistled to the sky.\n\nNot long after, something silver emerged from the ruins. Little Silver swiftly came before Han Sen.\n\nLittle Silver, bite the lotus and put it on his wounds.\u201d Han Sen gave Little Silver the lotus.\n\nLittle Silver took the plant and chewed it up. Then, he moved over and spat it out over Wood\u2019s wounds. The burned skin began to smoke, and it made Wood scream in agony.\n\nLittle Silver chewed up a lot of the lotuses and placed them atop all the wounds. And whenever the wounds came into contact with the lotuses, it was like a ladle of water being poured over smoldering charcoal.\n\nThe white lotuses turned black.\n\n\u201cBlack Steel, feed him some lotus,\u201d Han Sen told Black Steel.\n\nBlack Steel crushed up some of the lotuses and fed Captain Wood. He already seemed a little better after eating what he had been given. His wounds were still really bad, though. It would be difficult for him to be healed, but the mere fact that he was alive was enough for now. He would survive long enough for his body to recuperate.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Captain Wood gave Han Sen a complicated look.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. This is because of Black Steel. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t care whether you lived or died,\u201d Han Sen said coldly.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the reason is, you saved me. And that means I owe you.\u201d Captain Wood shook his head.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything in response. He really didn\u2019t like Wood, and the less he had to do with him, the better.\n\nXie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng soon appeared there. The marks on their foreheads had indeed disappeared.\n\nBlack Steel picked up Captain Wood, and Han Sen lifted the Sun Raven\u2019s body. The entire carcass of the bird emanated a strange power. It was not a xenogeneic, either. Han Sen was keen to research what the thing really was."
