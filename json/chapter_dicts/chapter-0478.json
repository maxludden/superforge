    "text": "Wang Hou's mind was almost shattered. He could not imagine that he would be forced to defend himself when using Sprocket Sword. Shocked and mad, he stepped back all of a sudden with the red crystal in his hand and said gloomily, \"I will let you die ugly.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Wang Hou put the red crystal on his forehead. Then, the red crystal suddenly lit up and shot a beam of red light.\n\nAs if they were led by the red light, the green mini crystals floating in the air all turned toward Han Sen as if they were commanded by some kind of invisible force.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had no idea that Wang Hou could actually use the red crystal to control other crystals.\n\nEven Han Sen himself did not know why the mini crystals did not approach Ji Yanran and him previously, so he could not think of any way to block the mini crystals.\n\nA sea of green mini crystals were already in front of Han Sen's face.\n\nSqueak!\n\nSuddenly, a low chirp came from Han Sen's pocket. The green mini crystals coming toward Han Sen suddenly froze as if time had stopped.\n\nAfter just a moment, the green mini crystals moved again. However, this time, their target was no longer Han Sen, but Wang Hou with the red crystal in his hand.\n\nWang Hou suddenly became pale, urging the red crystal hastily, but to no avail. The green mini crystals were completely out of control and covered his body instantaneously.\n\n\"Ouch!\" Wang Hou screamed painfully and rolled around on the floor. However, he soon stopped moving. All of his blood was gone in a second, and his body was dried up. Wang Hou stared his eyes wide, full of despair.\n\n\"Squeak!\" Han Sen's pocket sounded again. The green mini crystals flew up and returned to their nests in a spiral, fabulous but spooky.\n\nBoth Han Sen and Ji Yanran were stunned. Han Sen quickly opened his pocket and took out the green crystal unicorn beetle he put there.\n\nThe unicorn beetle was the same way, lying on Han Sen's hand languidly. It looked as useless as ever, but both Han Sen and Ji Yanran were amazed by it at this point.\n\nWithout a doubt, the reason that the green mini crystals got rid of Wang Hou's control and sucked him dry was completely this unicorn beetle.\n\nHan Sen was quite certain that he and Ji Yanran also needed to thank the unicorn beetle for keeping the green mini crystals away from them earlier.\n\n\"What is this?\" Han Sen looked at the unicorn beetle in his hand, shocked.\n\nJi Yanran only shook her head. She had never heard of such a thing. It seemed that only Crystallizers could control crystals, while Crystallizers did not appear in the form of any creatures, let alone a unicorn beetle.\n\nHowever, if this unicorn beetle was not a Crystallizer, how could it have controlled all those crystals?\n\nHan Sen put the unicorn beetle back to his pocket carefully. No matter what, Han Sen felt he had got himself a treasure. With the unicorn beetle near him, it would be much safer for him to enter any Crystallizer ruin.\n\nAfter putting away the unicorn beetle, Han Sen walked to the body of Wang Hou and picked up the red crystal.\n\nTaking the red crystal in his hand, the nine-life cat pendant reacted even stronger. However, after Han Sen put the red crystal next to the nine-life cat pendant, nothing strange happened.\n\nThere is no doubt that this piece of crystal is making the nine-life cat pendant react, but why is that? Han Sen gave it some thought and then put the red crystal on his forehead like Wang Hou did.\n\nAll of a sudden, Han Sen felt a warm stream flowed into his brain. It felt somewhat like when he used the brain crystal, but it was different in that he did not feel the electric shock, just the warmth.\n\n\"This is strange. How did Wang Hou use this piece of crystal to control other crystals?\" Han Sen did not find a method to use the red crystal.\n\nWhen Han Sen was in doubt, he suddenly felt the crystal was melting in his hand. Shocked, Han Sen wanted to remove the crystal from his forehead, but the crystal had already turned into liquid, which he could no longer catch.\n\nInstantly, the red liquid infiltrated Han Sen's brain, making it hotter and hotter. White vapor started to rise from Han Sen's hair.\n\nHowever, heat like that did not make Han Sen feel uncomfortable. To the contrary, Han Sen felt his brain was never so clear. The effect was even better than when he just used a brain crystal.\n\nVery soon, the heat in his brain gradually disappeared. Han Sen did not feel anything special other than a clearer brain.\n\nAfter the crystal was absorbed, the nine-life cat pendant was no longer hot and became an ordinary stone again.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Ji Yanran touched Han Sen's forehead, worried.\n\n\"I'm fine. This thing is similar to the brain crystals. How on earth did Wang Hou use it to control the other crystals?\" Han Sen asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Both Li Mingtang and Wang Hou are dead, so I'm afraid no one knows the truth anymore.\" Ji Yanran looked at the bodies of Li Mingtang and Wang Hou again. The two persons who were elite of the Alliance died in this ruin of Crystallizer royalty for a strange reason.\n\nHan Sen nodded but did not think so himself. Going through the stuff left behind by Li Mingtang and Wang Hou, Han Sen saw the access card with the nine-life cat image in Wang Hou's cardholder as well.\n\nTo his surprise, Han Sen did not find a similar access card in Li Mingtang's belongings.\n\nHan Sen went through other stuff without finding anything else of value. Han Sen returned everything to its original place, looked inside the castle, but did not go deeper.\n\n\"With this unicorn beetle, we should be able to exit the ruin safely and look for other people trapped here still.\" Han Sen took Ji Yanran's hand and went back, not wanting to raid the treasure at all.\n\nIt was mainly because everything would be taken by the Alliance once Han Sen returned to Daphne. There was no way he could cheat the scan. What worried Han Sen the most was whether the unicorn beetle would be found.\n\nCarrying the unicorn beetle, Han Sen found the other crystals did not dare to approach them at all. The Rubik's cube, simulating crystals, and parasite crystals would all freeze whenever the unicorn beetle approached. Nothing would attack them proactively.\n\nAlthough Ji Yanran and Han Sen did not recognize the paths, they would not run into any danger with the unicorn beetle.\n\nAfter more than half a day, the two of them eventually met other people who had entered the ruin including Chen Shoushan. After reuniting, the group of people found the entrance where they came from, thanks to the judgment of a professor.\n\nAfter they came out, they did not run into the simulating crystals again and returned to Daphne smoothly.\n\nThe two crystals that Han Sen took back did not escape the scan, but to Han Sen's joy, the unicorn beetle was not discovered."
