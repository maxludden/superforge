    "text": "When Han Sen placed the second drop of blood before the God Spirit Touch, it didn\u2019t behave any differently. It swallowed the droplet, then returned to its previous, motionless state. The four waited around for a long time, hoping something would happen. But there the bug remained, at the bottom of the canister, not moving an inch. If they hadn\u2019t seen it swallow the blood, they would have believed the insect to be dead.\n\nThe man frowned. He had no idea what was going on. He picked up the God Spirit Touch again, trying to make sure there was nothing wrong with it.\n\n\u201cWeird. No matter how bad his skills are, it shouldn\u2019t be possible for him to be entirely without an armor talent.\u201d The man continued to poke and investigate the creature, but he learned nothing.\n\n\u201cMaybe the God Spirit Touch is simply too old, and it can no longer shed its shell?\u201d Exquisite paused, then went on to say, \u201cThis God Spirit Touch is the very first God Spirit Touch that once belonged to the alpha, is it not? It performed tests here for much of the alpha\u2019s life, and that was eons ago. Perhaps it really has finally succumbed to old age.\u201d\n\nThe man shook his head and said, \u201cWhen Bixi brought Yu Shanxin here, they conducted the test just fine. That wasn\u2019t very long ago. Why would it suddenly stop working now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, aside from that, what other possibilities can you think of? There is no way that Han Sen is lacking even a single armor talent,\u201d Exquisite said. The man knew that was impossible, too. Without a four armor talent or above, reaching King class was impossible. If Han Sen was already King class, no matter how bad his talents were, he couldn\u2019t have an armor talent less than four. \u201cThis is weird,\u201d the man said with queer hesitation. He put out his finger and sliced it, releasing a thin trickle of his own blood. He let it bleed near the God Spirit Touch\u2019s mouth to see if the creature reacted like normal.\n\nThe God Spirit Touch had been lying in the same spot ever since consuming Han Sen\u2019s blood. It didn\u2019t react to the man\u2019s blood, at all. It was like it had become too old and numb to move a muscle.\n\n\u201cIt really is growing feeble in its old age?\u201d The man put his face close to the creature, staring at it in shock.\n\n\u201cIt has lived long enough. It has lived longer than most ordinary God Spirit Touches. Its aging was to be expected, eventually,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot conduct the test now,\u201d the man said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t have another God Spirit Touch nearby. It looks like we will have to go back and request another one. Then, we can take the test.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop testing him. I\u2019ve decided to make him my silkworm, so it doesn\u2019t matter how what armor talent he has,\u201d Exquisite said icily.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\nThe man started to say something, but Exquisite swiftly cut him off. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I can decide who I want to be my silkworm, and look: I have made my decision.\u201d\n\nThe man opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Eventually, he smiled and said, \u201cIf you have made your decision to accept this boy as your silkworm, then that is fine. In that case, let us proceed to the altar.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the man led them the remainder of the way. They continued on up the mountain.\n\nWhen they reached the palace that rested on the mountaintop, the man turned and said, \u201cExquisite, I will be waiting for you outside. If you need anything, please just ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond Brother, please take care of this child. I like this child, so do not upset her,\u201d Exquisite said while looking at Bao\u2019er. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Exquisite. I will take care of her,\u201d the man quickly assured her.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, wait for me here, and don\u2019t be a naughty girl. Okay?\u201d Han Sen put Bao\u2019er down. With Bao\u2019er\u2019s personality and power, it wouldn\u2019t go well for the man if he tried anything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very nice, dad,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, looking sweetly up at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen stroked her head and went to the hall with Exquisite.\n\nAfter they entered the hall, the hall door closed behind them. Han Sen couldn\u2019t see hide nor hair of anyone else in the hall. There was an altar at its end, however, and the sight of it prompted him to ask, \u201cThat Second Brother seems different from the other people here.\u201d\n\nExquisite continued walking toward the altar, but on her way, she said, \u201cThe children of the Very High are separated into two groups. One group suffers the Very High Sense, whereas the others can practice the geno arts they truly fancy. Brother Bixi and I studied the Very High Sense. Second Brother Liyu studied something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you have to be separated?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\nExquisite twitched slightly, but she pretended it was nothing. \u201cPracticing the Very High Sense gradually removes our ability to feel emotions. That can harm our breeding capabilities.\u201d\n\nNow Han Sen understood why they had to be separated. It was so their bloodline could continue. Otherwise, if all of the Very High transformed themselves into emotionless machines, they probably wouldn\u2019t reproduce at all. The race wouldn\u2019t have lasted very long in that case.\n\nHan Sen raised his head. The altar ahead looked a bit strange. There was a large platform that held a large furnace in its center. Aside from that, the altar was bare.\n\n\u201cPut a drop of your blood into the furnace,\u201d Exquisite said. She held out her finger and dropped her blood into it. Han Sen had known this was coming. Sky Palace Leader had told him what to expect. He lifted his own finger and quickly supplied the furnace with a drop of his blood.\n\nWhen the jade furnace took in the two drops of blood, it lit up. It began to glow with a shifting cosmic light, and something inside the furnace began to rumble.\n\nHan Sen looked at the jade furnace with curiosity. He couldn\u2019t see what was inside it, but the light and presence of the furnace were enough for him to tell that it was stuffed with knowledge about the universe.\n\nAs the light grew stronger, it began to gather on the carving on the front of the furnace. The engraved symbols were shaped into a rough triangle.\n\nThe light continued to shift restlessly, and the engraving glowed brighter and brighter. And then, the light within the furnace dimmed as it all rushed into the engraving\n\nWhen the triangular symbol burned like a sun, Exquisite said, \u201cPut your hand against that symbol.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich hand?\u201d Han Sen asked with a blink.\u201cIt is up to you,\u201d Exquisite said. \u201cMen go left, women go right. In that case, I will use my left hand.\u201d After that, Han Sen placed his left hand on the triangular symbol.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had pressed his hand against red hot steel. Han Sen jerked his hand away, and when he did, the light on the jade furnace\u2019s engraving vanished. A shining triangle was now branded on his left hand.\n\nWhen the burning sensation disappeared, the triangle vanished as well. Han Sen could no longer find any trace of it on his skin.\n\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d Han Sen looked at Exquisite with curiosity.\n\n\u201cYes, it is done,\u201d Exquisite answered with a nod.\n\nHan Sen knew that at this point, Exquisite should be able to feel what he felt and read his mind. His mind should have been an open book to her. So, he started imagining stuff to test it.\n\nIn a split second, Exquisite blushed and shouted, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like you really can read my mind,\u201d Han Sen said while looking at Exquisite."
