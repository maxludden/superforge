But as the spear spun, it disappeared from her hands. Where it went, Han Sen could not keep track of.\n\nHe didn\u2019t much care for this, though. All Han Sen wanted to do was focus on channeling energy and power into his greatsword for an attack of his own.\n\nThe angelic sword drifted in and out of reality, hovering amidst shards of distorted dimensions. It was like the image of some magical blade, taken from an ancient tale.\n\nHan Sen held it, now ready to slash the empress.\n\n\u201cDie!\u201d the empress yelled, as a creepy and excited look flashed across her face. The spear had appeared in front of Han Sen.\n\nThe empress thought she could plunge the spear through Han Sen\u2019s head before his sword landed a strike.\n\nSlash!\n\nThe empress\u2019 eyes opened wide in utter shock.\n\nHer body had been cut in half from a downward swing, and the face that dribbled blood across its center wore a look of fright. The serpent that had accompanied the empress now looked terrified, and it swiftly tried to flee the scene.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t going to allow that, however. He gathered up another surge of power to unleash at it to prevent its departure.\n\nDue to the empress having been killed, the giant snake was attempting to scramble and slither its way up over the rocks in a bid to escape the human. But it could not lose Han Sen, and he was quick to remain at its tail.\n\nQin Xuan and Bao\u2019er had felt an earthquake just a moment ago, so they had exited the mouth of the cave to come take a look.\n\nWhen they came out, they saw a hazy mixture of gold and copper lights. The scenery all around was destroyed like a post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nThe lights were coming towards them, with a trail of destruction being left in its wake.\n\nQin Xuan grabbed Bao\u2019er and took off running.\n\nQin Xuan had only just arrived in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, so her effort was in vain. She was too weak to run from the lights.\n\nNot long after her attempt of flight, she heard something most monstrous come from someplace behind her.\n\nThe copper light was on her heels, coming at a most fearsome speed. It was so close, and now Qin Xuan was able to see what that copper light was. It was a giant copper snake, similar to the ones people used to worship long ago. Its lifeforce was frighteningly strong.\n\nQin Xuan thought this had to be it, and that she was done for. She didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be an escape from this predicament. She held Bao\u2019er as if she were a real baby. She thought it was most likely a pointless thing, but she did so anyway, as if to protect it.\n\nThe snake wanted to dive down and head underground, and it was a simple misfortune for Bao\u2019er and Qin Xuan to be in its way.\n\nQin Xuan shielded Bao\u2019er from the sight of the beast and watched it come down.\n\nShe was a soldier, and she made sure to watch. She knew closing her eyes would not make a difference, and it would not reduce the danger that had befallen her. So she kept them open and stood strong. She did not let fear take hold, and she did not let the hope of a possible survival escape her.\n\nThe mouth of the snake had come down from above, tenting their position, and in that moment, Qin Xuan threw Bao\u2019er away.\n\nQin Xuan did not even know Bao\u2019er was a beast soul, she just thought by throwing her away, she might survive.\n\nAfter throwing her away, she faced her imminent death alone.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe serpent was about to close its teeth on her lonely body, but suddenly, another light flashed across her vision. Qin Xuan suddenly saw the snake reel back as its head was hewn from its coiling body.\n\nAfter that, its body began to flail backwards as the light ran through it from top-to-tail. Vertically, down the center, the body was cut into two perfectly symmetrical halves.\n\nThe snake had built up momentum though, and it leaned forward even in death.\n\nQin Xuan was still stood where she had been, as the rocky landscape around her began to crumble. She stumbled and grabbed a hefty stone to keep her balance.\n\nWhen the snake\u2019s flailing came to a stop, and the dust that had kicked up was all that could be seen, Qin Xuan saw a gold light pierce the haze.\n\nThere was a most beautiful goldfish coming towards her through the murk. She stumbled backwards. Even though it was a beautiful beast, she knew it was a creature.\n\nIf the snake had been killed by the goldfish, then the goldfish had to be even more powerful than it.\n\nShe wished to run, but Qin Xuan was afraid that if she did start to flee, the fish would attack her.\n\nBao\u2019er was waddling her way over to the goldfish as Qin Xuan mulled her courses of action.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, be careful!\u201d Qin Xuan pleaded, but it didn\u2019t stop her.\n\nBao\u2019er jumped atop the goldfish\u2019s head, and then Qin Xuan watched her jump into the arms of someone.\n\n\u201cHan Sen!\u201d Qin Xuan looked at the figure and the fish in awe, and when the dust had cleared just enough, she saw Han Sen standing atop the creature.\n\nHan Sen was delighted as this occurred, because he was in the midst of hearing the announcement play.\n\n\u201cBerserk Super Creature Serpent Throne killed. Beast soul gained. The flesh of this creature is inedible, but you may harvest its Life Geno Essence. Consume its Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points randomly.\u201d"
