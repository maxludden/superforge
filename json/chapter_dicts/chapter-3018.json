    "text": "In the ice bunker\u2019s testing room, Han Sen looked weird.\n\n\u201cAbout that, Teacher Han, can that really make me control blue blood power?\u201d Han Sen stood atop an ice platform with one leg. He raised his hands to balance himself out. He looked like an old chicken standing. He had been doing this for more than 10 hours now. Han Yufei forced him to stand like that the entire time. She did not allow him to do anything else. She hadn\u2019t injected him with any geno fluids or anything of the sort either. She hadn\u2019t taught him a new geno art, which made Han Sen very suspicious.\n\n\u201cIs this not enough? In that case, I should add some more,\u201d Han Yufei replied. She placed an apple on Han Sen\u2019s head. She lifted her black-framed glasses and squinted her eyes. \u201cControl your body. Keep it from moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeacher Han, is this really going to work?\u201d Han Sen wondered. He thought Han Yufei was playing with him. If standing there allowed him to control the blue blood power, why would she need high-class research apparatus? Sacred Leader\u2019s many years of research appeared to be going to waste.\n\nHan Yufei coldly asked, \u201cDo you know what still means?\u201d\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cI have learned many skills to train my patience. The geno arts I have practiced can enable me to control my own skills. I am confident about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Han Yufei was holding a thin and long stick. She pointed at Han Sen\u2019s chest and poked it.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was very still. It was like a mountain. He did not move.\n\nHan Yufei pulled the stick back and asked Han Sen, \u201cDid you feel anything with those two pokes?\u201d\n\n\u201cPain,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Han Yufei asked.\n\n\u201cWhat else could I possibly feel?\u201d Han Sen was confused.\n\nHan Yufei was holding her stick. She knocked Han Sen\u2019s chest with it.\n\n\u201cSo, you do not understand your body. You cannot even describe your feelings. Creatures of a high-level have bodily functions that are complicated. They have many systems inside them. Pain is just a simple feeling, but there are more changes and layers to it. You did not use your feelings to feel it. When the stick goes down, the clothes and your skin hit each other. When it goes against your skin, and when your muscles cave in and bounce back and your cells hurt, the small veins break. Did you really feel all that?\u201d\n\nHan Sen gulped his saliva. Although he controlled every inch of his muscles perfectly with the Dongxuan Aura, looking at himself and feeling himself was something he never bothered to do.\n\n\u201cUse your heart to feel your body\u2019s small feelings,\u201d Han Yufei seriously said. \u201cMake your body become absolutely still. If you can do that, it will be the time you can control the blue blood.\u201d\n\nHan Sen started to believe Han Yufei, so he seriously asked, \u201cWhat does being absolutely still mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make your body\u2019s organs stop running,\u201d Han Yufei explained. \u201cEverything stops. That will be you becoming absolutely still.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my body completely shuts down, that means I am dead,\u201d Han Sen said with a frown. Although making his heart stop jumping and blood stop flowing was not difficult for Han Sen, if his body\u2019s functions completely shut down, that meant he was dead.\n\n\u201cStopping does not mean dying. Becoming absolutely just means that your body becomes absolutely still. It does not mean your lifeforce is still. I told you that you wouldn\u2019t understand. You need to feel it. When your heart stops and your body is as still as a mirror, that means you have succeeded.\u201d Han Yufei used her stick to smack Han Sen\u2019s butt and said, \u201cKeep practicing. You do not have much time.\u201d\n\nHan Sen used his heart to feel that strike. When the stick hit his clothes, they pressed down on his hair. It made the hair rub against his skin. It gave him an itch. He then felt the clothes and skin rub each other. Next, he felt his skin and his vessels feel the pain.\n\nWhen the pain appeared, the blood inside was pressed. It made him feel swollen. It was clearly in Han Sen\u2019s brain. That complicated feeling could not be described in one simple word called \u201cpain.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei walked to her seat and sat down. She spoke to Dragon Lady and said, \u201cYou are very good at hitting people.\u201d \u201cI am only good at making food,\u201d Dragon Lady quietly said.\n\n\u201cTreat him like a slab of pork and go cook him.\u201d Han Yufei crossed her long, pretty legs and drank some tea as she spoke.\n\n\u201cWhat if I cooked it?\u201d Dragon Lady asked.\n\n\u201cIf his body, which has Sacred blood, is so easily cooked, then I can only say he deserved it,\u201d Han Yufei said.\n\nDragon Lady did not say anything. She walked over to Han Sen and raised her hands. Her hands held two knives. The one on the left was curved like a crescent moon, and the other was like half a moon.\n\nOne of those two knives was for cutting through bone. The other was to slice meat. For a chef, every blade had a different use.\n\n\u201cHey, you guys cannot be serious.\u201d Han Sen looked at Dragon Lady approaching him without the smallest flicker of emotion. He felt a chill.\n\nHis body was very strong, but she had Ancient God King blood. She was already a true god and not weak. If the knives were to come down, a very strong body would not be able to withstand the strike.\n\n\u201cOf course, I am serious. The body is yours, but feelings cannot be triggered on their own. You must have some other power outside to affect your body. When your body reacts, you can really understand your body. It is like a dumb kid that never went outside and never experienced gambling or drinking. He has never experienced what is good and what is bad.\u201d Han Yufei tried to slightly explain it. Han Sen felt as if what Han Yufei was trying to tell him made sense, but the description was weird.\n\n\u201cTake his clothes off first in case he makes them dirty,\u201d Han Yufei said to Dragon Lady, who was right next to Han Sen.\n\nDragon Lady did not speak. She waved a knife and cut open the blue robe he was wearing. The robe slid down. The knife made a few \u201ckatcha\u201d sounds. Han Sen\u2019s clothes were cut. They all fell to the floor.\n\nHan Sen noticed he only had his underwear left and yelled, \u201cThat is enough\u2026 That is enough\u2026\u201d\n\nDragon Lady looked at Han Yufei. Han Yufei did not raise her head as she asked, \u201cWhen you are cooking pork, do you leave the cloth on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dragon Lady answered. She waved her knife and Han Sen\u2019s underwear fell off.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder why this is a body that is combined with Sacred blood. Not bad,\u201d Han Yufei squinted her eyes to admire Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen wanted to say something, but the bone-cutting knife in Dragon Lady\u2019s left hand stabbed into his body. It made him take a deep breath. It hurt. His eyelids were quivering. He almost screamed.\n\n\u201cDo not move,\u201d Han Yufei said without emotion. \u201cUse your heart to feel your body.\u201d"
