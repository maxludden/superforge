    "text": "The dinosaur's interest was only suppressed by its fear. It stood behind Han Sen, wondering if it should approach.\n\nObserving the bone himself, Han Sen couldn't note anything particularly remarkable about it. With no value to himself, he just decided to throw it to the dinosaur and say, \"This is what you wanted, isn't it? Take it; it's all yours.\"\n\nThe blue dinosaur jumped away about fifty meters, to hide behind the worn architecture of the palace. Its eyes were fixed on the bone.\n\nHan Sen thought to himself, \"Its intelligence is very low, indeed. Doesn't it have a brain in that thick skull?\"\n\nBut then, another thought struck Han Sen. \"Hmm, maybe that's a good thing. Perhaps because it's dumb, it'll be easier to control. I learnt my lesson with the fairy; I could never properly control her, and that was because she was too smart.\"\n\nThinking of this, and then looking towards the scaredy-cat dinosaur, he felt a little better concerning the circumstances.\n\nHan Sen was still a little weak, in the grander scale of the Third God's Sanctuary. If he could use the dinosaur as a fighter, things would become considerably easier for him.\n\nHan Sen then started to ponder why it seemed so friendly to Han Sen, and yet so hostile to Qu Lanxi. Qu Lanxi was a pretty girl, so he was surprised to see the dinosaur take a liking to him and not to her, at all.\n\n\"Am I just too handsome? Am I so d*mn handsome even creatures fall in love with me?\" Han Sen pulled out a mirror and looked at himself from all angles, coming to the conclusion that his hypothesis was most likely correct.\n\nThe dinosaur started to slowly emerge from hiding. Despite its distance from the bone, it still looked utterly terrified.\n\n\"What should I call you? Wang Cai, maybe? Yes, that sounds good.\" Han Sen smiled and picked up the bone, continuing to say, \"Wang Cai, it is only a bone. Come here or I'll eat it.\"\n\nHan Sen pretended to bite the bone, but it did not incite the reaction he hoped to receive. The dinosaur remained where it was, unmoving.\n\nHan Sen started to harbor doubts over his initial belief that it'd be easy to command the creature. It was not only dumb, but a scaredy-cat, also.\n\nLooking at the bone, Han Sen knew he couldn't eat it. There was no meat, and it was incredibly tough.\n\nThe blue dinosaur continued to watch from a distance. Still hoping to get a reaction, Han Sen decided to place his tongue on the bone and give it a lick.\n\n\"Mmm, oh yeah! It tastes so good. Wang Cai, get over here; it's as safe as this thing is succulent.\" Han Sen smiled at the dinosaur as he spoke.\n\nThe dinosaur, seeing Han Sen lick the bone, carefully came forward.\n\nAfter Han Sen's lure, it made its way over to where he was. The dinosaur joined in with Han Sen, using its own tongue to lick the bone.\n\nSoon after, all semblance of the dinosaur's fear had gone and it licked the bone with a great appetite.\n\n\"That's right.\" Han Sen smiled, as his mind mulled the ways in which he could use the bone to make the dinosaur obey his every command. But then, the dinosaur opened its mouth and bit on the bone.\n\n\"Hey, don't eat it all! Save me some.\" Han Sen didn't want the dinosaur to consume the whole bone at once, as he needed some of it to lure and teach the creature.\n\nThe blue dinosaur cared little for the command, though. It merrily chomped away at the bone until it was down its throat, not saving any for Han Sen.\n\nAs Han Sen's heart sunk, the dinosaur roared to the sky in delight of its meal. Blue fire spewed out of its mouth like a geyser, which then fell down to wrap beast up in a blanket of blue flame.\n\nA second later, it was entirely enveloped in a scorching blue bonfire. The heat was intense, and the brightness was too much. Han Sen couldn't even open his eyes to get a good look at what was happening.\n\nFeeling the power in those flames, he made sure to cast his dongxuan aura to inspect it. All he could see, however, was a blur.\n\nFortunately, the blue spectacle did not last for long. Soon after, the flames subsided. And as the ribbons of fire shrunk, so too did the dinosaur.\n\nWhen the flames were only a meter high, the dinosaur had grown too small for Han Sen to see.\n\n\"Did the bone make him grow smaller?\" Han Sen looked at the solemn blue flame, wondering what happened to the dinosaur.\n\nThe flame now faded, as well. When it was twenty centimeters high, he spotted a blue metal ball as the source of the fire. It was around the size of a fist.\n\nTaking a closer look, Han Sen observed that it was more of an egg-shape than an actual circular ball.\n\nWhen the blue flame vanished, the blue egg remained where it had been on the ground.\n\n\"Did it evolve, maybe?\" He wasn't sure whether or not the dinosaur was a super creature, as he had never seen a super creature evolve before.\n\n\"Wang Cai? Are you in there, buddy?\" Han Sen squatted down to ask the ball, but he received no response.\n\nPicking up the egg, Han Sen tried to give it a squeeze and feel if there was something in there. He couldn't discern what the item was. He couldn't feel the beat of a heart, and his dongxuan aura only presented him a blurry image.\n\n\"Is it evolving, or is it being reborn?\" Han Sen wasn't sure, but he knew he wouldn't be seeing his blue dinosaur again for some time.\n\nThere was no life inside the egg, so whatever was in there, was most likely yolk.\n\n\"Should I cook it?\" Han Sen wondered, with a sinister grin.\n\nAs tasty as it might have been, Han Sen dropped the thought. If it was actually evolving, whatever came out of it would likely be incredibly powerful. Eating it would be a waste, in comparison.\n\n\"I guess I should keep it for now. It'll be pretty cool if it is actually a super creature.\" Han Sen stroked the egg and then said to it, \"Wang Cai, you better come out of this thing soon, okay? I need to put you to work; I need you to help me kill creatures. Don't be lazy!\"\n\nHan Sen pocketed the egg and then decided to return to the Alliance. He told Qu Lanxi and Chu Ming that the dinosaur had gone.\n\nThe two of them returned to the sanctuary, but there was nothing much for them to actually do there. All the three of them could ever do was exit the shelter and check whether or not they were at the edge of Thorn Forest. If they were still deep in its prickly depths, they would simply return to the Alliance.\n\nHan Sen followed mostly the same schedule, but he preferred to visit the second spirit base instead."
