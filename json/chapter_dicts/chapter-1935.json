    "text": "Han Sen was wandering aimlessly on the streets. He looked forward and saw a Buddha woman in the midst of a crowd. She was clad in white robes, and her eyebrows were like those of a painting as she smiled at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSpeechless Buddha Lady?\u201d Han Sen was shocked.\n\n\u201cMister Han! If you want, I can guide you around the Buddha Kingdom.\u201d Speechless Buddha Lady came before Han Sen and spoke to him.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIt was impossible to escape from the Buddha in Buddha Kingdom. Han Sen had nothing better to do, and she was freely offering to guide him, so he wasn\u2019t going to say no. And that aside, Speechless was pretty to look at.\n\nThen please follow me. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d Speechless smiled at Han Sen and then started walking.\n\nHan Sen felt strange. There were many people in the city, but it didn\u2019t seem as if anyone recognized Speechless. He wondered why no one gave him peculiar looks.\n\nSpeechless knew what Han Sen was thinking, though. She smiled and said, \u201cThe Buddha aren\u2019t very interested in celebrity. I rarely go out with my rank on display.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why?\u201d Han Sen nodded, and then asked, \u201cIs there anywhere special I can visit? I\u2019m sure you know the most interesting landmarks around here.\u201d\n\nYou can call me Speechless, by the way.\u201d Speechless paused and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t think ordinary relics would interest you, but there is a Buddha Wall that resides four hundred miles from here. It is a place that was visited by a half-deified Buddha King. You should take a look, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me Han Sen. Being called sir is strange.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nSpeechless Buddha Lady nodded and spoke about the origin of the Happy Buddha Wall. She spoke well, and she was pretty to boot. It wasn\u2019t a boring listen.\n\nThe Happy Buddha Wall was not created by Happy Buddha King. It was a student that drew an image of Happy Buddha King across that wall. That was how it came to be known as Happy Buddha Wall.\n\nHappy Buddha King was a very famous half-deified person, but he left a long time ago. His name was still commonly heard in the city, though, and he was a figure that was most well-known.\n\nThe student that drew his image was not any ordinary person, either. He was a legendary fellow.\n\nOut of the higher races, the Buddha society included the most outsiders. In the Buddha Kingdom, only one percent of its people were full-blooded Buddha. The rest were outsiders, and many of them were quite famous.\n\nSome of the famous outsiders were even Kings.\n\nThe person that drew Happy Buddha King was an outsider Duke named Silla. That person admired Happy Buddha King a great deal, so they wished to draw him a portrait.\n\nThere were many different stories. Silla met with Happy Buddha King ten times with the offer, and each time Silla was rejected. The eleventh time, however, Happy Buddha King allowed Silla to proceed. The Happy Buddha Wall was the result.\n\nBefore finishing the drawing, Silla practiced for three years straight in complete isolation. When Silla returned, Silla did so as a King. Silla eventually went on to become half-deified, as well.\n\nThere was a saying amongst the Buddha: Silla King was a famous King, but just like Happy Buddha King, history forgot them. All people now knew was the remnant of the Happy Buddha Wall.\n\nHan Sen liked the story, and when it came to a close, they were on Sky Cliff. That was where the wall was.\n\nHan Sen thought that the place, due to its sacred importance, would be well-protected. But there was not even a railing, and they were able to come right before the wall.\n\nThe Happy Buddha Wall was drawn on the cliffside. It was at least ten meters high. It looked rather strange.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Happy Buddha Wall from far away. He wondered, \u201cI thought this was an image of Happy Buddha King. Why are there two Buddha\u2019s painted on the wall? Which one is he?\u201d\n\nThe wall portrayed a Buddha sitting upon a lotus flower, smiling. But there was also a Buddha lady next to the Buddha. She was holding his neck, and they were locked in a kiss.\n\nSpeechless smiled and said, \u201cI thought there were a lot of gods in the beliefs of the Rebate. Happy Buddha King is our lover god. Happy Buddha King is called Ming King, and the Buddha lady there is Ming\u2019s wife. They were both deified, and forever together. They were both called Happy Buddha King.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d Han Sen may have said that, but inside, he thought, \u201cIsn\u2019t this like a combination of two? I thought it was just one King, but it was in fact a horny old man and his woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is sense, and sense is not nothing. Nothing is not sense. Where the senses are, is where the Buddha are.\u201d Speechless spoke to Han Sen seriously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand this. It seems as if I am not suitable enough for the Buddha.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nSpeechless smiled and said, \u201cI cannot tell you if this is suitable for you, but perhaps by looking at the wall, you may learn a thing or two. When Silla drew this picture, Silla King learned of what it meant to be happy. The happiness is inside this very wall. If this is your fate, then you will learn something, also.\u201d\n\nHan Sen examined the Happy Buddha Wall, but could not learn anything. He gave a wry smile and said, \u201cIt seems as if I am not suitable for the Buddha, as I am unable to glean anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a way for you to see it, but I will have to help you. Are you willing to try this?\u201d Speechless\u2019 beautiful eyes peered right through Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIf you are willing to help, then of course.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cOkay, then look into my eyes. Tell me what it is that you see.\u201d Speechless smiled at Han Sen, as her eyes began to show some form of movement.\n\nHan Sen looked at her eyes, but her eyes were too pretty. It was difficult to describe how beautiful they were. They were crystal-clear, and looking at them made people want to stare in awe.\n\nHan Sen felt like his vision was becoming sucked into her own. Within the reflection of her eyes, he clearly saw himself. But the shadow was so strange, and he saw himself naked. He wore nothing in front of Speechless Buddha Lady.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had just been shot in the head. So many thoughts rushed to his mind all at once, many of which made him blush.\n\nSpeechless\u2019 eyes continued looking at Han Sen. They became watery, and she looked at Han Sen strangely."
