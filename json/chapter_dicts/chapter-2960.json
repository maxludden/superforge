    "text": "The lantern\u2019s light was suppressed by the knife stream. The area that could be lit up for protection was small, so it could not protect the whole holy palace. Some walls outside the holy palace were hit by the knife streams. It left knife mark after another knife mark on the stone walls.\n\nIt was unknown what the holy palace\u2019s stone walls were made. With the power of Han Sen\u2019s knife airs, he was only able to leave small marks upon the construct.\n\nEven so, under the endless knife stream that attacked, the knife marks in the stone wall grew greater. They all went by each other, making it look like the walls were going to come undone.\n\nThe demon lady and the others were shocked. Back then, there were five race lanterns there. During the battle, the holy palace did not break.\n\nNow, only three race lanterns were protecting the holy palace, yet this was just Han Sen alone. It was not a god or some spirit.\n\nHan Sen was operating alone, but he had the necessary might to overcome the defensive attributes of the race stone lanterns that were working in tandem with each other. It was too shocking.\n\nSeeing the three stone lanterns were dying right there and then and about to have their flames extinguished any second, the demon lady, Old Vulture, and eyeless beast felt a bit of regret.\n\nIn their eyes, the creatures of the sanctuaries were just test subjects left behind by Sacred Leader. Aside from Littleflower\u2019s body reaching the requirements needed for another that was as great as Sacred Leader, which made him be considered one of the fruitful test subjects, other creatures of the sanctuaries were deemed failures of test subjects. They were not worth mentioning. They were not worthy of them wasting their breath explaining.\n\nEven though Han Sen had the Holy Kirin\u2019s holy spirit, from what they could tell, he only received it out of dumb luck. It was because his soul was extra heavy.\n\nThe heaviness of the soul did not affect the talent practice. The speed needed to level up, so they did not care too much about it.\n\nHe could not use the holy spirit, which proved that Han Sen did not have the necessary qualifications for replicating Sacred Leader. He was considered a failed subject.\n\nWho would thought that a failed test subject could suppress three race lanterns with only a knife? He was going to break the holy palace\u2019s last line of defense.\n\nIf the holy palace was destroyed, the hope of rebuilding Sacred would buckle with it. That was not something that had to do with power. Without the holy palace, even if Littleflower\u2019s holy body became a true god and was as strong as Sacred Leader, it would only lead to the repetition of history.\n\nThe demon lady and the others knew they needed this holy palace and someone who could control the holy palace. That way, they could fight against the God Spirits and the sky. They could rebuild the past glory of Sacred and maintain it.\n\n\u201cIf I was willing to have a nice chat with Han Sen, perhaps it would not have come to this.\u201d The demon lady was sad, but there was no pill of regret to take. She sensed that Han Sen had a firm resolve to destroy the holy palace.\n\nThere was a knife stream. It was like a galaxy falling. It almost put out the three race lanterns. The radius of the light was small. They were only able to light up a small portion of the holy palace\u2019s gate. The walls around the holy palace were hit by the knife stream. Knife marks kept increasing. Stone and dust were everywhere. They were watching the last hope of Sacred be torn down by Han Sen\u2019s knife stream.\n\n\u201cRoar!\u201d Suddenly, there was a roaring sound. It sounded like a lion or a tiger. It was coming toward them. A red shadow quickly appeared out of the dark. It was like a crazy, running blob of lava.\n\nThe demon lady, Old Vulture, and eyeless beast saw this. It made them terribly happy. It was Red Ghost.\n\n\u201cRed Ghost, hurry up!\u201d Old Vulture screamed with excitement. \u201cLight your race lantern! Let\u2019s protect the holy palace!\u201d\n\nRed Ghost did not know what was going on, but he saw Han Sen suppressing the demon lady and others with a knife. Even the holy palace\u2019s stone walls were about to buckle and fall. He could not risk hesitating. He opened his mouth. A stone lantern appeared. It went in front of the holy palace.\n\nThe four stone lanterns were all together. The fire inside the three stone lanterns was almost gone. It was like they were now filled with gas. The fire rose high. The holy palace was lit up, and so was the plaza around them.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s scary knife stream hit the light. He was not able to suppress the light. Four stone lanterns combined into one powerful light, releasing a power that was not just one plus one equals two. The four race lanterns were like a set. The power of the four lanterns was greater than three lanterns. They had some special buffs.\n\nOld Vulture saw Han Sen was incapable of defeating the race lanterns and so he mocked them. \u201cHan Sen, no matter how strong your body is, it is not a holy body. You cannot use a holy spirit armament or a race lantern. You will never achieve what Sacred Leader accomplished. After all, you are just a commoner.\u201d\n\nAlthough Han Sen tried his best, just like Old Vulture said, his power was not enough to break the four stone lanterns\u2019 defense.\n\nEven Under the Sky Knife skill\u2019s knife stream failed to do it. Other geno arts were even worse off. He couldn\u2019t break the defensive attributes of the light.\n\n\u201cDo I really have to use my xenogeneic battle body?\u201d Now, Han Sen only had one way to increase his power. He only had the xenogeneic battle body left. It would have increased his fitness a lot, but no one knew if the xenogeneic battle body would be enough to destroy the light\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, you are holding Sacred\u2019s main lantern. You can try it.\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat\u2019s voice came from not too far away. He came out of the darkness and stood near the plaza.\n\nUpon hearing Sky Palace\u2019s first seat, the expressions of the demon lady and the others immediately changed.\n\nHan Sen looked at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, Sacred has five race lanterns. There is one superior lantern and four lesser ones. When Sacred was destroyed, Sacred Leader used the five race lanterns to secure the holy palace. Even the sky and the God Spirits did not get god benefits. It left Sacred with some hope.\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat looked at the demon lady and their four stone lanterns. He went on to say, \u201cSacred\u2019s race lanterns are different from the race lanterns of others. They have four subordinate race lanterns. One race lantern is the primary one. The subordinate race lanterns can only protect. They cannot trigger powerful power. Only the main race lantern can buff the creature\u2019s race power, and you can control the four subordinate lanterns. Right now, Sacred\u2019s main race lantern is in your hands. If you can control it, you can control the four subordinate race lanterns. If you want to break the holy palace, it should be a piece of cake for you.\u201d\n\nThe faces of the demon lady and the others changed. They did not expect Sky Palace\u2019s first seat to know so much about Sacred\u2019s race lanterns.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Old Vulture screamed. \u201cYou are all the dogs of God Spirits. In the beginning, aside from Sacred elites like me and the others, only the God Spirits saw the power of the race lanterns.\u201d\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat did not argue with him, nor did he feel compelled to explain. He just went on to tell Han Sen, \u201cRight now, we need to see if you can control the primary race lantern. If you can control it, everything is possible.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Sky Palace\u2019s first seat and asked, \u201cHow is this going to benefit you?\u201d\n\nSky Palace\u2019s first seat quietly said, \u201cI can only tell you that people from Sky Palace do not want to see the second rise of Sacred. I am being honest. You do not need to ask me, and I won\u2019t answer you.\u201d"
