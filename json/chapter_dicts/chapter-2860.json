Dragon One was killed like that\u2026 The Dragon\u2026 It is game over\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s voice sounded extremely weird. Although no one could see Demon Alpha\u2019s body in space, her vision was still scouring that portion of the empty. It was like a body that looked like a Demon and a ghost was in front of the woman.\n\nSky Palace Leader sighed and said, \u201cSuccess is brave, but there is also bravery in failure. I hope the Dragons will be able to overcome this loss. I hope they do not sink in the river of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dragons used all their power to produce this latest Dragon leader, but he was easily cut up like that in space. The Dragons are in danger\u2026\u201d The woman shook her head with a wry smile. \u201cWho is this Demon Alpha anyway? She has such a scary power. With the resources the Demons have, there is no way they could have made someone like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis era is messed up.\u201d Sky Palace Leader did not answer her. He looked into space, which was far away.\n\n\u201cInteresting\u2026 Very interesting\u2026 Although I could not see 100 Dragons coming out together, it was still amazing.\u201d God held his hands and laughed. He looked satisfied.\n\n\u201cDo you know this Demon Alpha? How could she possess such scary powers?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nGod shook his head. \u201cDid I not tell you that God does not know everything? I am just like you. I only know what I see. I have never seen Demon Alpha before, so I do not know anything about her. There is one thing I know for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIn her hands, that little dry bone knife was a god personality armament,\u201d God said with certainty.\n\nWhen Han Sen heard that, his expression changed. He thought, \u201cIf Demon Alpha really is Asura, then Ancient Devil and the Asura really did summon a dying god. Was that a God Spirit? With their power back then, how were they able to kill the God Spirit? Even though the God Spirit was heavily injured, it would have still been impossible. Their powers were on vastly different scales. There could have been no chance. Even God hides, so why would it let them kill him? They still did not have the power to kill a God Spirit\u2026 Does it mean that after Asura went to the universe, he killed the God Spirit and got the god personality armament?\u201d\n\nHan Sen could not guess the truth either, but he was really bothered by Demon Alpha looking just like Zero. \u201cIt looks like I need to find a chance to talk to Ancient Devil and Yasha again about what Asura really was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat God Spirit\u2019s god personality armament is that?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThere are too many gods, and I do not remember all of them,\u201d God said after touching his nose.\n\n\u201cAre there really that many gods?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\n\u201cThere are not many real gods,\u201d God said. After saying that, he did not say any more.\n\nDemon Alpha\u2019s fight shocked the whole universe. The Demons were famous among the higher races. Now, they had become the most famous in the whole universe. Everyone knew the Demons would rank up soon. It only depended on if Demon Alpha was daring enough to trigger the lantern fight.\n\nWith Demon Alpha\u2019s power, the Demons could enter the top 10 races without any trouble.\n\nThe factions with a similar power to Demon Alpha were feeling as if they were facing a crisis. They thought Demon Alpha might destroy their race at any moment, or she might take their territory and xenogeneic space and pillage and plunder them for the Demons.\n\nSome races saw the potential of an alliance. Many had already sent messengers to try and befriend the Demons.\n\nAll this did not really have a connection to Han Sen. After he became butterfly class, there were not enough resources to support his ascension to true god. He watched other fights alongside God.\n\nAside from the battle between Demon Alpha and Dragon One, there weren\u2019t any more interesting battles. All the elites just fought to a point where a winner could be determined. Few dared to lose their lives in combat there.\n\nWhat happened to Dragon One made every elite a whole lot more cautious. They would not underestimate any opponent they encountered.\n\nGolden Growler was still winning like an invincible foe. The scary power he wielded had been agreed by most as the greatest. Most believed it was highly likely that Golden Growler would win the tournament. They thought he was even greater than Demon Alpha.\n\nSky Palace Leader and the Very High Leader did not need to be described. They just talked their enemies out of the way. One could not really tell how strong they were.\n\nHan Sen cared about a guy called Lou Lie, who used his body to become a butterfly class xenogeneic. Most importantly, Han Sen found there was something familiar about him.\n\n\u201cIs he a member of Blood Legion?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\n\u201cThis Lou Lie is interesting,\u201d God said with a smile.\n\n\u201cWhy is he interesting?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHe is better than you think,\u201d God casually replied. \u201cHe is a real human.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he human? In that case, what are you going to do?\u201d Han Sen forced his question to sound nonchalant, but he really wanted to know what God would do if he found out about another human.\n\n\u201cI do not plan on doing anything yet. I will keep watching the matches and wait for interesting spirits to fight each other.\u201d God\u2019s answer surprised him.\n\nHan Sen thought humans were taboo for the universe. God found out Lou Lie was a human, so he wagered he would do something.\n\n\u201cDo not look at me like that. I am a God and not a crazy dog. Do you think I will bite whatever I see?\u201d God laughed.\n\nHan Sen looked at God and said, \u201cI thought you treated humans differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would treat them differently, but the geno god list plays by my rules. It would be lame of me to break my own rules.\u201d After that, God looked like he was smiling, but he wasn\u2019t smiling at Han Sen. \u201cWhat about you? You treat humans differently too. Why do you disguise yourself as one?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you already that I am human. There is no pretending,\u201d Han Sen said with a simple shrug of his shoulders.\n\nThe two of them were in-sync, so they stopped talking about it. They continued to watch the geno god list fights.\n\nThere were many scary elites in the universe. Han Sen thought the geno god list would be dominated by the three high races, but things really did not turn out that way. Many deified elites were from the three high races, but most of the deified elites were not from the three high races. There were many races Han Sen had never heard of before.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the universe has many scary creatures hiding in it. I must be careful.\u201d Han Sen had a look at his next opponent. It was a butterfly class Deep Abyss Knight. It was quite powerful. It crushed other xenogeneics of the same level to reach this round.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cAlthough he is powerful, I do not think he can challenge me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next few fights will be really boring. Would you like to play some chess?\u201d God stretched as he spoke to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen did not decline. He wanted to play chess with God.\n\nAlthough he always lost, his chess skills were improving because of these losses.\n\nThe game of chess was like a game of fighting. The more he improved in chess, the newer the areas and ideas Han Sen could learn for proper combat. That made him keep on wanting to play.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s personality, if he did not win a round, he would not give up.\n\nAfter dozens of heart-breaking rounds of chess, Han Sen\u2019s next fight finally rolled around.\n\nHan Sen stood up and said. \u201cKeep the game going. We will continue when I return.\u201d Their match was only halfway through. It looked as if he was going to win, so he wanted to quickly finish Deep Abyss Knight before continuing with God.\n\n\u201cOK. Good luck to you,\u201d God said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen accepted the geno god list invitation and went to the space battleground."
