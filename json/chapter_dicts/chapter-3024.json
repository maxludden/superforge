I have his power, and I have the genes of God Spirits. It makes me the king of the universe. The whole universe will serve me.\u201d\n\nIt was like Qin Lan was being answered. The whole universe was resonating with the holy spine. In space, countless numbers of weird powers went to the holy spine. It made the holy spine and Qin Lan\u2019s power all the more powerful. It was going to break the sky.\n\nLittleflower\u2019s power was very shocking. Compared to Qin Lan\u2019s power now, he was suppressed. It was like a commoner versus a giant. There was a big difference. Littleflower looked serious. He did not appear as if he wanted to fall back. His battle spirit was burning. A black and white flame was rising. It fought against that scary suppression.\n\n\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The holy spine in Qin Lan\u2019s hands finally moved. It was like a sharp sword thrusting toward Littleflower\u2019s heart.\n\nLittleflower wanted to raise his hands and block that strike, but he suddenly discovered that his body had been locked down by the universe. He was not able to move.\n\nAll of that only happened in a moment. It did not allow Littleflower to react. The weird spine was thrust into his chest. Even Sacred Leader\u2019s armor could not withstand the force of the holy spine. The holy spine pierced through it. \u201cWhat should have come has finally arrived.\u201d In an old building upon a mountain, the fortune-telling old man closed his eyes and sighed.\n\n\u201cFinally\u2026 It is starting\u2026\u201d Old Cat, in front of the palace, looked very excited.\n\nQin Lan was looking insane and ugly. He was excited as he held the holy spine and laughed loudly. \u201cSo what? Even if it is Qin Xiu\u2019s armor, so what? Even if you were chosen by Qin Xiu, you are not as good as me. I am the only one who can be better than Qin Xiu.\u201d Qin Lan\u2019s madness still wasn\u2019t finished. His expression suddenly changed. In the next second, his madness and smile turned into ghastly shock.\n\nQin Lan was so scared that he screamed. It looked as if he wanted to get rid of the holy spine in his hands, but he looked electrified. He could not get rid of it.\n\nQin Lan\u2019s power was going into the holy spine. The holy spine, which was in Littleflower\u2019s chest, seemed to melt. It turned into a blue fluid as it went into Littleflower\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 Impossible\u2026\u201d Qin Lan\u2019s face was severely twisted. He felt wronged, hopeless, scared, helpless, angry, and hateful.\n\nwas\n\nNo matter what he thought, he could not get rid of the holy spine. His body\u2019s lifeforce kept heading for the holy spine. He was rapidly growing old. His very handsome and young face was suddenly turning into the face of a middle-aged man. Even his hair was turning white.\n\nMoment God\u2019s face changed. She gathered up time god power and tried to strike Han Littleflower. Unfortunately, the time god power was still quite a way away from Han Littleflower and Qin Lan. It was like it was falling into endless space. It could not get close to them.\n\nAll the creatures in the universe watched as Qin Lan started to age. The man who was once an invincible elite had become an old man with white hair and on his death bed. His lifeforce was extremely weak. It was like it was hardly there at all.\n\nPang!\n\nQin Lan finally got rid of the holy spine. He fell to the floor, but he was so old that he could not even get up anymore. He used his tired, old eyes to look at Han Littleflower.\n\nThe holy spine had completely melted and become fluid in Littleflower\u2019s body. The armor\u2019s broken spot was already fully healed. Aside from the two black and white lights, Littleflower had blue power flowing through him. It quickly combined with his body.\n\nThe armor also looked as if it had been dyed blue. The black armor started to show some weird blue symbols.\n\nBoom!\n\nA pair of blue wings opened up behind his back. They went all the way into the nothingness. It was like they connected with the very universe.\n\nLittleflower\u2019s eyes now looked blue. Moments before, they had looked murderous. Now, they appeared rather calm. He was even smiling.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 You are\u2026 You are\u2026 Cough Cough\u2026\u201d The dying Qin Lan saw his face. His entire body started to shiver and shake. It was like he had discovered something extremely scary. His eyes opened as far as they could go. He could not keep talking\n\n\u201cYou did a great job. Your work is done here. You did fine.\u201d Littleflower looked at Qin Lan kindly. It was like some elder who was complimenting a young man. \u201cImpossible\u2026 Impossible\u2026 That is impossible\u2026\u201d Qin Lan seemed to understand something. All the emotions inside him drove him insane. He tried his best to lift his old body. He wanted to jump at Littleflower, but he fell to the ground after taking only two steps. He angrily looked at Littleflower. At the same time, his face was drenched with a distinct lack of hope. His hands tried to grab Littleflower, but he ran out of power. His hands just slumped. His eyes were still opened wide. He was not able to close them.\n\n\u201cMy poor child, you do not have to do this.\u201d Littleflower sighed. He did not look at Qin Lan. He looked at the geno hall ahead of him.\n\nIn Blood Legion\u2019s palace, Human King stood got up from his throne. He looked weird as he said, \u201cQin Xiu really didn\u2019t die. That Qin Lan was unfortunate. He thought he had discarded Qin Xiu\u2019s control a long time ago and destroyed Sacred. He had no idea that was what Qin Xiu wanted all along. If he had not entered the geno hall and combined his genes with a God Spirit to create the holy spine, Qin Xiu would not have finished evolving. Now, he is being repelled by the universe. Who would have thought Sacred\u2019s biggest traitor was the key to Qin Xiu\u2019s rebirth? Qin Xiu used a body to be reborn. He has a powerful body and is not repelled by the universe. He is like those God Spirits. He has the power of the universe\u2026 Very good Qin Xiu\u2026 Very powerful conspiracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod\u2026 I\u2026 Qin Xiu came back.\u201d Littleflower looked at the geno hall. He smiled and walked toward it.\n\nMoment God wished to attack, but there was suddenly a loud booming noise. It was followed by the geno hall\u2019s door opening. A hand touched her shoulder. She was unable to go out.\n\n\u201cGod\u2026 Mister\u2026\u201d Moment God turned and looked at the body that was touching her shoulder. She immediately bowed.\n\n\u201cGo back. Go back to your god temple.\u201d God patted Moment Goddess\u2019s shoulder and warmly smiled. Moment God politely bowed and ran back to her Moment God Temple.\n\nThe entire universe could see the body that had come out of the geno hall was the shape of a lady, but it did not have any power. It was unknown why Moment God was being so nice to her.\n\nLone Bamboo saw the lady\u2019s face. When he did, he was so shocked that he screamed, \u201cWan\u2019er!\u201d"
