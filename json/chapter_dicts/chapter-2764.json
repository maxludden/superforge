    "text": "In the days that followed, Han Sen didn\u2019t eat or drink much. He spent all his time modifying Under the Sky and Break Six Skies.\n\nUnder the Sky wasn\u2019t very compatible with Break Six Skies, so Han Sen would have to use his dual pistols from Spell to channel the power. And Break Six Skies had to be modified, as well. He might not be using the geno art\u2019s full destructive capability, but the explosive power had to be sufficient to annihilate God\u2019s Knife. Only by doing that could Han Sen perform his one-second judgment into the past.\n\nThis was a very big project. Han Sen focused all his attention on modifying the skills. He wanted to make the technique as perfect as possible. God\u2019s Knife was such a scary being. If there was the slightest flaw in his plan, Han Sen would lose the fight and die.\n\nBut Han Sen was confident that he had what it took. Sooner or later, he\u2019d make it work.\n\n\u201cNow that I have sorted out how to deal with the Super Space Slash problem, I must move on to the last problem that is standing in my way. How can I actually destroy God\u2019s Knife?\u201d While Han Sen was practicing, he mulled over this next task.\n\nIf he was unable to destroy God\u2019s Knife, blocking Super Space Slash was pointless. Reaching a stalemate would be the same as losing. Gu Wan\u2019er would remain trapped either way.\n\nBut with Han Sen\u2019s current resources and power, he couldn\u2019t defeat God\u2019s Knife.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t break it, then I must find a way to trap it. Maybe Turtle would be a good choice for that, but I just don\u2019t know if it will work on God\u2019s Knife.\u201d\n\nHan Sen realized that his imagination alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to solve the problem. Whether he was attempting to predict his opponent\u2019s attack vector or trying to determine the effectiveness of Turtle, he needed to perform real-world tests. He had to see how his plans worked out in proper combat.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I still need to go to God\u2019s Farm. I wonder if God\u2019s Knife is still on the Demon Sheep Planet?\u201d Once Han Sen finished modifying Under the Sky and Break Six Skies, he planned to go to God\u2019s Farm.\n\n\u201cThe path other people walk is the path for them. I have to walk my own path.\u201d Han Sen continued not to eat and drink, and he kept chipping away at his modifications to the geno arts. He didn\u2019t sleep or rest for two weeks.\n\nEvery time he thought of Gu Wan\u2019er having to use her own blood to feed that knife every day, Han Sen\u2019s heart ached.\n\nBefore the modification works were finished, Exquisite came back. But this time, it was only her. Li Keer didn\u2019t join her.\n\n\u201cThe leader still isn\u2019t willing to let me out?\u201d Han Sen asked, glancing at Li Keer. He was already prepared.\n\nExquisite didn\u2019t answer Han Sen. She only coldly told him to follow her. Then, she flew toward the mist.\n\nHan Sen was surprised. This was well beyond his wildest expectations. Exquisite was going to lead him out of the bottle. Han Sen had never expected the Very High to actually free him.\n\nBut if he was able to leave there so easily, he wasn\u2019t going to hesitate or complain. He flew to catch up with Exquisite, and he followed her through the mist.\n\n\u201cDoes the leader believe that I\u2019m not cursed?\u201d Han Sen asked Exquisite.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say or ask anything. I\u2019ve got this. You just need to be quiet and follow me,\u201d Exquisite said without even looking at him.\n\nHan Sen could feel there was something amiss here, but he didn\u2019t dare to speak again. He remained silent and followed after Exquisite.\n\nExquisite guided the two of them through the mist, and they eventually emerged outside the bottle.\n\nThe hall that held the bottle had such powerful restrictions that they didn\u2019t need a Very High to guard the place. Exquisite had used a small stamp to enter, and it kept the restrictions from affecting her. She led Han Sen out of the hall.\n\nAfter exiting the hall, Exquisite placed her hand on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder. She was going to teleport both of them away from that place.\n\nBut Han Sen took her hand, stopping her from using Galaxy Teleport.\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen with confusion, and Han Sen looked back at her with a very serious expression. In a quiet voice, he said, \u201cAnswer my question. Are you taking me to the leader?\u201d\n\nExquisite hesitated a bit, but then she shook her head and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWith that answer, Han Sen was almost certain that his guess was correct. He persisted and asked Exquisite, \u201cThe leader hasn\u2019t given you permission to take me out of the bottle world, has he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to concern yourself with such matters. I\u2019m taking you away from Outer Sky. After you leave Outer Sky, you should go back to Sky Palace. Tell everything that happened here to Zhang Xuandao. If he is willing to keep you, I don\u2019t think our leader will try to take you back from Sky Palace,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s expression became unreadable. He knew what was happening now. Exquisite was taking a huge risk. She was breaking the rules and setting him free on the sly.\n\nHan Sen had never expected that Exquisite might do something like this for him.\n\nHan Sen had only thought of Exquisite as a tool for accelerating his growth, but now, he couldn\u2019t consider her that way anymore.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen asked, giving Exquisite a complex look.\n\n\u201cYou came into this place alive. I\u2019m going to make sure you leave this place the same way,\u201d Exquisite said with an emotionless look.\n\n\u201cIf I leave, what is going to happen to you?\u201d Han Sen knew the Very High\u2019s rules were strict. The Very High could be an extremely heartless people. If someone broke the rules, they wouldn\u2019t look on the transgression kindly.\n\n\u201cNothing much will happen. All I have done is set my silkworm free. It isn\u2019t a big deal. And I have other things to do, anyway. Stop wasting my time,\u201d Exquisite said coldly.\n\nHan Sen nodded and said, \u201cYes. We really can\u2019t waste any time. Take me back to the bottle world.\u201d\n\nExquisite froze. Then, she looked at Han Sen with confusion and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct. If you had destroyed your contract with me and trapped me in the bottle world and scolded me, someday I would put my knife to your neck and leave this place by force.\u201d Han Sen paused, and then he went on to say, \u201cBut if you let me go like this, I will feel very guilty. I cannot owe someone this much.\u201d\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been with the Very High for very long, but he had taken the time to read their cruel rules. He knew what would happen if she let him go. She might not be killed, but she would be imprisoned for a century.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s personality wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen. He didn\u2019t mind fighting people. No matter how cruel the enemy was, he could find a way to kill them. But he was afraid of people treating him too kindly. He didn\u2019t want to owe anyone too much.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know how he could pay back a woman who had wasted her youth on him. He didn\u2019t want Exquisite to be in jail on his behalf for a hundred years. So, he had no choice but to stay.\n\nOf course, Han Sen also had a plan. His situation wasn\u2019t hopeless. If it had been hopeless, he would have simply left and taken Exquisite with him.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t do that just yet, because Exquisite might not completely betray the Very High to be with him. So, Han Sen had to reject Exquisite\u2019s good intentions.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t owe me anything. This isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Exquisite said to Han Sen casually.\n\n\u201cHow can a century of jail time be considered nothing? How many centuries can you even live for?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Exquisite was shocked.\n\n\u201cSend me back.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t answer. He calmly looked at Exquisite with soft eyes.\n\n\u201cYou need to know that if you miss this chance, you risk being trapped inside the bottle\u2019s world forever.\u201d Exquisite looked at Han Sen with a conflicted expression.\n\n\u201cNo, I will not. I will use my powers to leave. Nothing can trap me there,\u201d Han Sen said firmly. His face looked so confident, as if he was telling her that 1 + 1 = 2."
