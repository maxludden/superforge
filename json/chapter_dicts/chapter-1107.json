Not wanting to risk anything ill, he knew he had to sit the fights out.\n\n\u201cI wonder if I can still take part, somehow?\u201d Han Sen was really disappointed he could not contend.\n\nAlthough he was unable to be there, Han Sen still tuned in to watch the fights. As he viewed them, he mulled to himself how he could hold his own against emperor spirits through his super king spirit mode. They wouldn\u2019t stop him from reaching the top ten. The only thing that would prohibit him from breaching the top ten rankings would be if he ended up going against an emperor spirit with ten of its gene locks opened.\n\n\u201cI have to improve my normal self. I personally need to grow stronger, so I don\u2019t always have to rely on super king spirit mode,\u201d Han Sen resolutely told himself.\n\nHan Sen: Super Body Super King Spirit\n\nLevel: Surpasser\n\nLifespan: 400\n\nBody Evolution Requirement: 100 Geno Points\n\nOwned Geno Points: Ordinary Geno Points \u2013 100; Primitive Geno Points \u2013 100; Mutant Geno Points \u2013 100; Sacred-Blood Geno Points \u2013 100; Super Geno Points \u2013 5\n\nHe had managed to max out four tiers of geno points. With the bonuses of his hyper geno arts, his fitness had managed to hit two-thousand-one-hundred.\n\nHan Sen was undoubtedly the strongest surpasser out there, no contest. But compared to super creatures and king spirits, he was still leagues away from what they were capable of.\n\nAny super creature, even the lowliest of them, would possess a fitness level of at least three thousand.\n\nBut by now, at least, most of the crystallized light that plagued his body had been refined. While a few of his organs were still in a crystallized state, they didn\u2019t hinder his fighting capabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have my powers back,\u201d Han Sen thought, using his Dongxuan Aura.\n\nThe gene locks he had opened in Ancient Devil Shelter had been shut down. He hadn\u2019t practiced them since that day, so no progress had been made at all.\n\n\u201cThis is strange. How can an open gene lock be shut down? That Ancient Devil\u2019s light power could not replace my own power.\u201d That thought, at least, was something for him to feel glad about.\n\nIf the power was depleted when a gene lock was opened, it could lead to major issues during real fights.\n\nHan Sen was starting to suspect the opened gene locks were artificial, and that his actual gene locks had not been opened. Perhaps he and all the other creatures in that shelter had been tricked into feeling as if their gene locks had been opened, but it was nothing more than an illusion.\n\nBut with his crystallized light not going to be an issue very soon, Han Sen did not have to worry too much about it.\n\nHan Sen visited the Saint Hall community, wanting a new hyper geno art. He wanted one to reinforce his stomach.\n\nHis Curse of Immortality had finished, so he no longer felt it gouging his insides in a demand for food.\n\nBut in the event something similar occurred, further down the line, he figured it would be best for him to put some work into bolstering the strength of his stomach. Plus, if he was able to eat more than he currently could, recovery could come swifter.\n\nHan Sen found a good many hyper geno arts that dealt with what he was looking for. In fact, there were seven different ranks of stomach-related hyper geno arts.\n\nThe reason so many had been developed was partly down to humanity\u2019s ravenous appetite\u2014in that, folks often wanted to be able to digest more meat at a time.\n\nUnfortunately, the hyper geno arts weren\u2019t all that effective. And the cream of the crop would only allow you to eat up to three times more than you usually could. That was good, but it felt like it could be better.\n\nFor Curse of Immortality, not even those hyper geno arts would be enough.\n\nHan Sen perused the S-class hyper geno arts and walked away disappointed.\n\nSo, he gave Bai Yishan a call and asked for advice and what he could do or what he could find.\n\nThe answers Han Sen got off him were disappointing, as well. The hyper geno art Han Sen wanted did exist, but to get it, a certain price had to be paid.\n\nIt came at the expense of a visible stomach increase. He\u2019d be able to eat up to ten times more than he currently could, on average, but his belly would be rather big.\n\nAnd what\u2019s more, he\u2019d have to fill his stomach with food every time he wanted to eat. If he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d only feel hungry.\n\nThat being said, the Alliance had no shortage of materials and food to fill up one\u2019s stomach. Being able to consume ten times more than what he usually could would be no trouble for Han Sen there.\n\nBut the same could not be said for the sanctuary. You couldn\u2019t always eat food there, and thus, it\u2019d prove troublesome.\n\nAnd if collecting ten times the normal amount of food was no problem, it\u2019d prove cumbersome to carry around each and every day.\n\nFor the times where there was no food, though, it could be extra dangerous. Having learned this hyper geno art, you could starve to death in three days without the proper nourishment.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t planning on learning a skill with so many negatives, so he ended up going back to pick up an ordinary S-class hyper geno art called \u201cNourishing Stomach.\u201d It allowed for the simple three times increase of what a person could eat and it also sped up digestion.\n\nIt did not match the requirements Han Sen had hoped for, but it was better than nothing.\n\nAnd Han Sen thought he might be able to find a better one in the future, anyway. This would just do for now.\n\nBack in the sanctuaries, Han Sen thought of ways in which he might slay a super creature.\n\nThe barrens were not host to any, and Han Sen hypothesized it was due to its proximity to Devil\u2019s Realm.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m going to have to pick up stakes and move on. And when I open my tenth gene lock, I\u2019ll return to kill Big Mara.\u201d Han Sen really wanted to go back to his underground shelter.\n\nThere were many super creatures in Thorn Forest, but he hadn\u2019t a clue where he was or how he\u2019d get back there.\n\nAll of a sudden, Queen returned to the shelter, too. She was covered in blood and severely wounded.\n\nWhen Queen saw Han Sen, she fainted."
