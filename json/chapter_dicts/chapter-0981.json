He believed doing that could enable him to become a demigod, allowing him to practice the next Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nOf course, that was just him guessing.\n\nIn the Dongxuan Sutra, committing a Life-and-Death Breakthrough was incredibly dangerous. Even the most powerful of people could die using it, and traditionally, there was only a ten percent chance of survival when doing such a thing.\n\nDongxuan Zi explained that when he created the Dongxuan Sutra, he ensured its Life-and-Death Breakthrough had a higher success rate, though. It was apparently over fifty percent.\n\nThe Wedding Dress Skill said that if a woman was willing to sacrifice her learning of the skill, it\u2019d allow a man to perform a Life-and-Death Breakthrough with a hundred percent success rate.\n\nIn Dongxuan Zi\u2019s era, people who survived Life-and-Death Breakthroughs were regarded as gods.\n\nDongxuan Zi himself was the only known person to have performed one successfully.\n\nThe Wedding Dress Skill could enable a person to do what he did. It was a dizzying feat, and the entire concept was quite sweat-inducing.\n\n\u201cIt may be a Qi Gong, but this thing is useless to me.\u201d Han Sen downloaded the details and removed it from his PC.\n\nHe then returned to the shelter and hid the rubix cube there.\n\nHan Sen: Super Body Super King Spirit\n\nLevel: Surpasser\n\nLifespan: 400\n\nKing Body Evolution Requirement: geno 100\n\nOwned Geno Points: ordinary geno points = 100; primitive geno points = 100; mutant geno points = 74; sacred-blood geno points = 14; super geno points = 5.\n\nSuper King Self-Spirit Points: 118\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fitness was not bad, and he had been doing well so far. But for now, he wanted to open more gene locks.\n\nHe did not leave the shelter in fear of meeting Yaksha again.\n\nOne day, while Han Sen practiced his Dongxuan Sutra, he received a notification that Qin Xuan was looking for him.\n\n\u201cTeam Qin, long time no see.\u201d Han Sen smiled, looking at her in the video.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, do you have Taia?\u201d Qin Xuan asked seriously.\n\n\u201cLiu Meng gave it to me. Is that a problem?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHe was surprised, and he was now witnessing firsthand how serious the Qin family took this business with the Taia sword.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to sell it, would you mind selling it to us?\u201d Qin Xuan asked.\n\n\u201cDo you mind telling me why this sword is so special?\u201d Han Sen knew this sword was nothing ordinary.\n\nQin Xuan said, \u201cThis sword just means a lot to us, and it is a secret that pertains to our family. What I can tell you, though, is that it\u2019s useless in the hands of others.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and said, \u201cWell, if I want to sell it, I\u2019ll come looking for you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not mind doing her a favor, but Taia was his primary weapon for the time being, and he needed it to kill creatures. Until he found a better replacement, he had to hold onto it.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d Qin Xuan sounded relieved. Then she proceeded to say, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else for the time being. I would like you to know I am establishing a training class for the Special Security Team. Would you mind being a tutor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope; I can\u2019t teach.\u201d Han Sen was surprised at the sudden request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be teaching directly from a textbook. And you\u2019ll only need to do it from Skynet. It\u2019ll take one hour each day for a month. If you are busy, we can schedule a replacement for certain days. We can fit it around your timetable.\u201d Qin Xuan smiled.\n\n\u201cWhen does it start?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cDay after tomorrow. Over twenty thousand people have signed up,\u201d Qin Xuan said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach archery, then.\u201d Han Sen was only spending his time practicing the Dongxuan Sutra each day, so squeezing in an hour to do something else would be fine.\n\nHan Sen was still a member of the team, too. He was still being paid wages, despite not having done anything for the longest time. And being a teacher for newbies might be fun.\n\n\u201cWhen are you free, then? I need to sort out the rota.\u201d Qin Xuan was visibly delighted at hearing Han Sen could join.\n\nAfter their discussion on that, they chatted about their lives for a while.\n\nQin Xuan did not want to become a surpasser yet. Ever since the discovery of super genes, many people wanted to focus on maxing out their level with the new genes before ascending to the next sanctuary.\n\nSome people managed to collect the eggs of super creatures, to obtain their super geno points.\n\nBut there weren\u2019t many eggs, and if that is how they were to focus, it was likely only one person could max out their super geno points in a century.\n\nPeople in the Alliance believed Han Sen had a different method of obtaining super geno points, but Han Sen was Han Sen; they didn\u2019t dare do anything to offend him.\n\nIf they tried making a move on Han Sen, they feared Godslayer Luo would unleash his wrath upon them.\n\nThat aside, he was Ji Ruozhen\u2019s son-in-law. As such, no one dared touch him.\n\nIt would have been even more difficult to get to Han Sen in the sanctuary, too.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is to be the tutor?\u201d In a mansion someplace, a man read a list of names. When he saw Han Sen\u2019s name there, he was surprised.\n\n\u201cWhich Han Sen?\u201d a red-haired man asked, looking back.\n\n\u201cThere is only one Han Sen. It\u2019s the Han Sen,\u201d the man responded.\n\n\u201cWhat is he teaching?\u201d the red-haired man asked.\n\n\u201cArchery,\u201d the man answered.\n\n\u201cI previously had no interest in going, but I can\u2019t miss this.\u201d The red-haired man lifted his eyebrows."
