    "text": "The guard\u2019s water AoE didn\u2019t give him any feeling of security. As those blue wolf eyes stared at him, cold sweat snaked its way down the King\u2019s forehead and across his face.\n\nOwooooo!\n\nThen the blue metal wolf howled again. Its strong limbs unleashed a grand amount of power. The water AoE was strengthened by the falling lakewater, but even so, it wasn\u2019t enough to trouble the blue metal wolf.\n\nThe blue metal wolf\u2019s body blurred, and then it was opening its mouth and biting into the guard\u2019s body.\n\nPang!\n\nThe wolf\u2019s teeth sank into the King\u2019s body, and at that moment, he exploded like water. His armor and weaponry were chewed up and swallowed.\n\nThe body itself had turned into water, however, and that water surged out of the wolf\u2019s mouth and transformed back into a man that was headed for the lava sky.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the Extreme King! That must be his water element King body.\u201d Han Sen watched the King class guard become a waterman, then head for the lava sky. Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to let him run off, and so he stopped the man and used the Thunder God Spike to pierce his body.\n\n\u201cI am Prince Sixteen. Get out of my way!\u201d the King shouted.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid of Han Sen, though. He was just afraid of that blue metal wolf. It had eaten his armor and lance, and now it was coming for him with hungry eyes.\n\nIf he was stopped by Han Sen, the blue metal wolf would be able to attack him once more. He knew that the wolf had to be some sort of deified being. He wouldn\u2019t be able to win in a fight against it. His Original Water King Body would be useless against a deified enemy. He had been incredibly fortunate to escape the first time.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m your daddy, King Bai.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t believe him, and so he pounded the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum and thrust the Thunder God Spike towards the man. He wanted to stop the King guard at all costs.\n\nThe King guard saw the blue metal wolf approaching him. He didn\u2019t have time to hesitate. He gritted his teeth and ran into Han Sen\u2019s Thunder God Spike without taking the time to evade.\n\n\u201cVery good.\u201d Han Sen had no intention of going easy on him. The Thunder God Spike perforated the guard\u2019s Original Water King Body. The Thunder God Spike couldn\u2019t be withstood by someone who was half-deified, so Han Sen didn\u2019t believe a King body could overcome the lightning\u2019s wrath.\n\nThe Thunder God Spike pierced into that watery body, its silvery lightning flashing all throughout the liquid. The water body started to brighten.\n\nBut the electrified water body didn\u2019t fall back toward the wolf. Han Sen heard the King scream, coming straight toward Han Sen. He then managed to hit Han Sen.\n\nThe water body smacked Han Sen, then shattered. The guard was all over Han Sen.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Han Sen shouted. The lightning in the water shot into him, so he was also electrified. His hair was blasted straight, and he almost fell out of the sky.\n\nThe blue metal wolf down below howled at the pair. It looked ready to unleash another attack. Han Sen fought off the numbness that was taking over his body, flapped his wings, and returned to the lava.\n\nAfter Han Sen teleported back to the lava and quickly began swimming upwards. He felt as if something was wrong with him. The King class guard had become water and splashed across him, and due to this, he had been electrified. The water was gone, but it felt as if it was now inside his body.\n\nHan Sen could clearly feel a strange, watery power inside him. It was sinking into his body and trying to merge with his cells.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of me!\u201d Han Sen shouted angrily.\n\n\u201cHa! Do you think I want to do this? If you hadn\u2019t pushed me into this, I wouldn\u2019t have performed Return to Origin to combine with your body. I am one of the Extreme King. You should feel honored to have my body combine with the body of a rubbish race like yours. Ha\u2026 weird\u2026 You have some blood of the Extreme King within you. Even God is helping me! It\u2019s weak, but it\u2019s better than nothing, though.\u201d The King\u2019s voice echoed within Han Sen\u2019s body. It was like Han Sen\u2019s own cells were screaming at him.\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. If he had known that this would happen, he wouldn\u2019t have stopped the guy. He would have just let him walk away.\n\nThe man who claimed to be Prince Sixteen wasn\u2019t using some skill that could take over a person\u2019s mind. His technique allowed him to merge their cells and attempt to combine their very bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, you really are Prince Sixteen?\u201d Han Sen asked, using some of his power to fight back against the invasion of his body.\n\n\u201cHa, my name is Bai Yi,\u201d said the voice.\n\n\u201cMy prince, how about this. Let\u2019s pretend that nothing happened between us. You get out of my body, and we both go our separate ways,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cAre you scared now? It\u2019s too late. Once the Return to Origin starts, not even I can reverse it. I will have to overtake your body,\u201d Bai Yi said with a cold grunt.\n\n\u201cThink of a way to stop it!\u201d Han Sen tried repeatedly to remove his enemy. Neither Jadeskin nor his Blood-Pulse Sutra could stop the invasion of that power.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to waste your breath. I told you: this is Return to Origin. I have now become a part of you. I will be you. I will sink into your cells and even your genes. And then, I will replace your cells and your genes. And then, you will become me,\u201d Bai Yi said with grim certainty.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this something like a village surrounding a city?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed.\n\nWhen ordinary creatures tried to take over his body, they usually ended up in his Sea of Soul. But this guy was doing things the opposite way. He was starting to combine with Han Sen from the body, which kept him from going into the Sea of Soul where he would be destroyed by the black crystal armor.\n\nRight now, Bai Yi\u2019s Original Water King Body was inside Han Sen\u2019s cells. If Han Sen wanted to get rid of him, he\u2019d have to destroy his own cells. But that also meant he would have to destroy his body. It put him in a difficult situation.\n\nWhen the Original Water King Body started to replace Han Sen\u2019s own cells, he felt the change.\n\n\u201cEnjoy the final moments of your life. You will soon become me, and I will take all your things. That includes your body, your will, and even your memories. Everything belonging to this body will become mine,\u201d Bai Yi said with a cold laugh.\n\n\u201cYou are too naive.\u201d Han Sen chuckled. He used Spell, and a mysterious symbol appeared on his forehead.\n\nThe solidifying power of Eternity covered his body. It cemented his body as it was, forbidding any changes.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of power is this?\u201d Bai Yi screamed in shock."
