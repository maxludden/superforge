    "text": "\u201cHe has such frightening strength\u2026 How many races with hidden power are there, scattered across the universe?\u201d Li Keer murmured in surprise.\n\nHan Sen, Dollar, and now Shale\u2014all of them were fierce. And yet, they weren\u2019t members of high races. In fact, their ancestry was barely even noteworthy. And yet, they all had crazy powers that even the Very High had never seen before.\n\nMany of the Very High were having similar thoughts as they watched the fight. The ordinary Very High, the ones who hadn\u2019t practiced the Very High Sense, were quite average. None of them were any stronger than Han Sen or Shale.\n\nThe Very High that practiced the Very High Sense certainly had incredible abilities, but it wasn\u2019t as if the mere practice of the Very High Sense could give them the level of power that was now being displayed. When their silkworms became deified, however, they would gain experience that would lend them a lot of strength and willpower. Such a process would dramatically boost their development.\n\nThis was the case with Exquisite and Li Keer. Right now, they weren\u2019t as strong as Han Sen. They couldn\u2019t defeat him in battle; Exquisite had even failed to beat him when she was a level above him. But over time, they would learn everything they could as Han Sen became deified, and it would propel them forward. Although they would not yet have achieved deified status personally, their minds would be as strong as Han Sen at deified status.\n\nWhen Mo Fang realized that he would be unable to suppress Shale, a strange gleam passed over his eyes. He focused his full concentration on his opponent, and his third eye tore itself open. It became a tai chi yin yang eye that shone with crystal clarity.\n\nThe moment the eye opened, Mo Fang\u2019s entire presence changed. He hadn\u2019t become the lifeless, machine-like being that Exquisite turned into, but he still wielded a power that would make all who fought against him cower.\n\nThe moment his third eye opened, the three half-deifieds that were following his mental commands suddenly lurched. Their eyes lost focus. They became puppets, operated entirely by Mo Fang\u2019s will. It was like they were merely extensions of Mo Fang\u2019s body, dancing to his whims.\n\nThe three half-deifieds felt sick. They had been selected as silkworms, yet they had ended up in this humiliating situation. It was very likely that their masters would end up picking new silkworms.\n\nThe moment Mo Fang opened his Very High Eye, the situation of the battle was flipped on its head. Shale had regained the upper hand, but now he seemed to lose it again.\n\nThe four silkworms were no longer a group composed of Mo Fang and the three other half-deified outsiders. It was now a group of four Mo Fangs. The other three Mo Fangs used their original powers, but their bodies were entirely controlled by Mo Fang\u2019s mind.\n\nUnder that giant tide of pressure, Shale\u2019s eyes looked bright again.\n\nThe fight became insane. The four Mo Fangs had different powers, and Mo Fang used them to make countless combination attacks. And now, Shale had no chance to fight back.\n\nAlthough Shale wasn\u2019t yet losing the fight, he couldn\u2019t find any way to mount an effective counterattack against his opponents. The fight continued, and Shale began accumulating wounds again.\n\nAt this time, the Fox woman quietly walked over to Han Sen, who was still in the middle of recovering.\n\n\u201cAh, Han Sen, Han Sen\u2026 You are finally in my paws.\u201d The woman lifted her hands and placed them on his back.\n\nHan Sen was still practicing, but he could still tell what was going on around him. He knew every movement of the Fox woman. He was preparing to stand up and fight her when he heard a shout.\n\nThat noise came from Shale\u2019s mouth, and it was like thunder rolling across the sky.\n\nAlthough Shale was still in combat with Mo Fang, he had been keeping an eye on Han Sen\u2019s situation. When he saw that the Fox woman was making a move behind his back, his eyes flashed. He let out that lion\u2019s roar.\n\nSuddenly, Shale\u2019s body expanded to become twice as big. All of his muscles bulged, and a red ball of light manifested like a fire outside his body. The wavy blonde mane straightened in the fire. He looked like a lion-headed demon god.\n\nShale was having a nasty fight against Mo Fang already, but now Shale\u2019s transformation forced Mo Fang to fall back. His abrupt retreat threw off his rhythm of attacks. Shale ran toward Han Sen and threw a punch at the Fox woman.\n\nThe Fox woman was shocked. She teleported away, vanishing like a cloud and avoiding Shale\u2019s punch.\n\n\u201cShale! Why are you going against me on behalf of our enemy?\u201d The Fox woman frowned at Shale.\n\n\u201cI told you I would protect him for ten hours. Anyone who touches him will become my enemy.\u201d Shale stood next to Han Sen, looking as cold as a demon god.\n\nMo Fang stared at Shale in astonishment. Shale\u2019s power and presence were entirely different. He had already been in such a tough fight, but he clearly hadn\u2019t been using all of his power.\n\n\u201cMo Fang, how about you and I fight him together?\u201d the Fox suggested to Mo Fang. She knew she couldn\u2019t defeat Shale by herself.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Mo Fang didn\u2019t want to lose or abandon this fight, so he had to take advantage of every opportunity that came his way.\n\nThe Fox woman didn\u2019t say anything more. Her body shone with a red light that solidified into a full set of red, metal-plated armor. It encased her body, leaving only her tail waving gently on the outside.\n\nThat tail then split into nine. Nine fox tails were swinging in the air. The pink area then spread to enshroud the space all around them. Shale\u2019s body was suddenly ensnared by a pink chain that was barely visible in the haze. It tied up his body, and it looked as if he couldn\u2019t move.\n\nWithout any communication, Mo Fang immediately guided his four bodies to attack Shale. All of the areas landed on Shale.\n\nWhen the five half-deifieds came against him, Shale reacted in utter rage. His eyes were on fire, and his body was like a volcanic eruption.\n\nShale roared furiously, and a scary power exploded the binding chain. His fists were like a pair of fiery warhammers. They annihilated space and struck one of the Extreme Kings.\n\nMo Fang guided the Extreme King to raise his arms and block the incoming strike, but beneath the cruelty of that punch, his attempt was futile. The man\u2019s area-buffed arm bones were shattered by Shale\u2019s strike. The fist proceeded to land against the man\u2019s chest, and it sent him flying away like a meteor.\n\nPang! Pang! Pang! Pang!\n\nShale was like an unstoppable demon god. Every punch sent another enemy streaking away. Mo Fang and the other three silkworms he commanded hurtled through the air, and none of them had even been given a chance to fight back.\n\nThe punches looked very simple, but things were actually far more complicated beneath the surface. Only Mo Fang knew that Shale\u2019s seemingly simple punches somehow subverted all of his plans to counterattack. It was like each punch was designed to stop whatever ability he tried to activate.\n\nThe four punches were a little different each time. Different powers were released against the different bodies.\n\nThere was only one explanation for how Shale could do this; he must have known the powers and attack methods of each individual fighter. That was the only way this was possible.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean that while we were attacking earlier, he was studying our attack patterns? To this level?\u201d Mo Fang thought as he flew back through the air. His back slammed into a nearby mountain, and the force of the impact drove the air from his lungs in a ragged cough. Blood spilled over his lips. He struggled a little, but he couldn\u2019t get up. His heart was in so much shock, he could scarcely believe it."
