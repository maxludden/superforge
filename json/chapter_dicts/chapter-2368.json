    "text": "Han Sen coughed awkwardly to fill the silence.\n\n\u201cHave you tried using your little sword to fix the situation?\u201d Han Sen suddenly realized he was talking about Ning Yue\u2019s \u201clittle sword,\u201d and he quickly shook his head to get rid of the thought.\n\nNing Yue looked at him strangely and said, \u201cI have tried everything! I\u2019ve tried destroying it and throwing it away. I\u2019ve even tried selling it. No matter what I do, my body remains like this. And whenever I go to sleep, the thing is lying on my chest when I wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like this is an evil sword\u2026 What are you going to do?\u201d Han Sen knew Ning Yue was a very decisive guy. He wouldn\u2019t have contacted Han Sen just to share some idle gossip.\n\n\u201cThe little green sword came from a mine in a xenogeneic space. So, I went back there and searched Hell King\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t find much. While the mine was mostly a dead end, I did discover something interesting. The Hell were under the control of another race, and this master race had given them the job of running the mining operations. Building palaces and statues was just a cover-up; their real purpose was getting to what was under the mines.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Ning Yue went on to say, \u201cIn order to figure out this green sword, we have to start with the mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be best if you leave the xenogeneic space for now,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on a planet belonging to the Thousand Treasures. Before I left, I erased all traces of my presence there,\u201d Ning Yue said.\n\n\u201cDo you know who was behind all this?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I only discovered that a master race was controlling the Hell by piecing together all the information I could find. There is no evidence to back this up.\u201d Ning Yue shook his head.\n\nHan Sen was silent for a moment. \u201cGive me some time. I\u2019m currently having some trouble of my own, and I cannot leave the Extreme King just yet. If you wait for me, I will find a way to contact you once I get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ning Yue didn\u2019t say much after that. They arranged a few more details and then hung up.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face was twitching. He wanted to laugh, but he couldn\u2019t.\n\nLuckily, Ning Yue was a calm man who took misfortunes in stride. If the same thing had happened to Han Sen, it would have driven him crazy.\n\nHan Sen brought out a galaxy map belonging to the Extreme King and looked up the xenogeneic space Ning Yue had mentioned. It wasn\u2019t listed. He also searched for the system that xenogeneic space supposedly resided in. The system belonged to a small race under the authority of Sky Palace. The race was so small that they were virtually unknown.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this small race. Not many people know about that xenogeneic space, clearly.\u201d Han Sen then thought to himself, \u201cThe Hell and the faction behind this are very secretive. This cannot be their territory. Perhaps they aren\u2019t allied with Sky Palace, and that is why they operated this mine in secret. If they are hesitant to re-enter that xenogeneic space, Ning Yue and I might have a chance.\u201d\n\nAs he considered his options, Han Sen started to develop a headache. The biggest problem right now was his inability to leave the Extreme King. Miss Mirror wouldn\u2019t let him go free.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s limited power was a problem. Deified xenogeneics could be dug up from the ground in that place, and he didn\u2019t have enough power to deal with one if they discovered it. If he wanted to go there, he would have to take the little red bird. Otherwise, things could go horribly wrong if they stumbled across another elite.\n\nIf he ended up attracting something awful like Ning Yue had, Han Sen wondered what might happen. The mere thoughts he conjured were enough to give him the chills. His skull felt downright numb.\n\n\u201cStill, Ning Yue isn\u2019t the sort of person to rush into something. He\u2019ll be fine waiting. I should really just focus on my current situation before doing anything more.\u201d Han Sen frowned as he thought of this.\n\nHe and Lan Haixin sorted out a time to meet. He wanted to see this relic she spoke of. If he was able to claim it, it might provide a grand boost for his power.\n\nEven if Lan Haixin nabbed it, she was Bai Yi\u2019s wife. Han Sen would be the one to help her with the relic, so surely he would get something out of the deal.\n\nHan Sen decided that going with Lan Haixin and the others wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, so he wasn\u2019t to upset about being dragged along. In fact, he found himself rather curious.\n\nHe had little time before they went to see the relic. Instead of going to King\u2019s Garden on that day, he studied the secrets of the Dongxuan Sutra at home. The Dongxuan Sutra was different from other geno arts. Even if he leveled up, he still had to understand how to use his developing powers. They weren\u2019t skills he could just use right away.\n\nHan Sen knew basically nothing about the elemental body of the Dongxuan Sutra. It was similar to the Dongxuan Aura, but he could tell that there were some important differences. Han Sen now had to figure out what it was exactly.\n\nHe also spent some time studying the Move Mountain Sea Conch beast soul, which he found quite interesting. The blue light it cast was amazing, but when it was cast upon creatures, it didn\u2019t have a direct effect. After a few days of investigating, Han Sen discovered something. He understood the true way to make use of the Move Mountain king area.\n\nOutside Underwater Town\u2019s palace, the Siren nobles gathered together. There was a surprising number of them, probably two hundred in all. There were five King class Sirens and one that was half-deified.\n\nLan Haixin was King class. The remnants of the Siren race weren\u2019t too shabby, but they wouldn\u2019t work for Han Sen. They only followed the commands of Lan Haixin.\n\nBai Yi was the last generation of the virgin\u2019s blood, and he was Lan Haixin\u2019s husband. But as far as those Sirens were concerned, he was nothing.\n\nIf Han Sen hadn\u2019t made an impressive amount of progress in recent times, they would still be looking at him with disdain.\n\nLan Haixin brought Bao\u2019er to the front of the line. Seeing Han Sen and the blood kirin approach, Bao\u2019er looked terrified. She hid behind Lan Haixin and tugged at her clothes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Big Sister is here. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt you,\u201d Lan Haixin said soothingly, lowering herself to hug Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cSuch a talented actress\u2026 It really is a waste that she hasn\u2019t taken up a career in acting.\u201d Han Sen wanted to cry at the sight. Bao\u2019er was way too good. If he didn\u2019t know the real Bao\u2019er, he would have been completely fooled.\n\nHan Sen chuckled coldly and looked at Bao\u2019er. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that she is my daughter. I am warning you. Do not touch Bao\u2019er. You won\u2019t be able to withstand the consequences of my anger.\u201d\n\nSeeing that Bao\u2019er was still pretending to be scared and hiding behind her, Lan Haixin stared at Han Sen and said, \u201cOkay. But you aren\u2019t taking her with you. She isn\u2019t one of the Siren.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Bao\u2019er and licked his lips.\n\n\u201cWe are going. We cannot leave her here. Don\u2019t worry, she won\u2019t affect us.\u201d Lan Haixin pulled Bao\u2019er forward and ignored Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen shrugged and rode after her on the blood kirin.\n\nThe Siren were queuing in the rear, all of them looking quite excited. They were looking forward to what came next.\n\n\u201cPrince, can I stay behind?\u201d Lilly stood behind Han Sen and quietly asked for permission.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d Han Sen looked at Lilly strangely.\n\nLilly started to answer, but suddenly, an old female Siren next to Lan Haixin hissed, \u201cThis is a big day for the Siren, and all of us need to go. Unless you\u2019re not one of us?\u201d\n\nLilly was shocked, and she wrapped her arms defensively around her own body. She lowered her head and didn\u2019t say anything."
