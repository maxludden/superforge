    "text": "The broken shells were strange to see. They did not look as if they had been removed from the creatures with a fine weapon. The whole cave was littered with the shells, and there was not a single living thing to be found.\n\nWhen Han Sen reached the deepest recess of the cave, he was dismayed to learn there was nothing there. No eggs: nothing.\n\n\u201cWho could have done all this and broken the eggs? Is this the work of a human or a spirit?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nIt was pointless to wonder now, though. But just as Han Sen readied himself to depart, he was overwhelmed with a chill that suggested he was in immediate danger.\n\nHe turned around and threw a punch without thinking. The gauntlets collided with a dark-green claw, and when they met, the force sent him flying backwards. As he careened through the cavern, he broke through many crystal walls.\n\nDisloyal Knight ran to the monster to engage it, providing time for Han Sen to stand up. The pain he was feeling was excruciating, but he knew he did not have the time to wallow around.\n\nWhen his eyes focused, he was shocked to see Disloyal Knight in conflict with a dark-green spider. It was the size of a household room, and it was hairy.\n\nDisloyal Knight threw a punch, but before it could land, the spider fired a web to tangle and nullify its potential damage.\n\nDisloyal Knight was strong, but the web was far too sticky for him to do anything against it. The web was like a million, syrupy rubber bands.\n\nThe web knotted its way around Disloyal Knight\u2019s arm, and the spider continued to unleash stream after stream of the web. Eventually, Disloyal Knight was practically cocooned. He had been rendered unable to move.\n\nPang!\n\nThe metallic claws of the spider struck against Disloyal Knight\u2019s armor and left a deep cleft across his chest.\n\nWith its foe trapped and unable to move, the spider made the most of this opportunity to keep attacking.\n\nHan Sen now knew what the shells were. They were the shells of bugs that had been killed by the spider.\n\nThe meat of the prey had all been eaten, leaving behind the ruined remains of a husk. That\u2019s what the tattered shells were.\n\n\u201cThis spider must have been birthed from the egg that was said to be here. What a horrifying creature; to murder and dine on so many hapless victims. It makes me shudder!\u201d Han Sen was strangely excited about this ordeal.\n\nThe eggs had not been taken, and neither had they been eaten, they had become a super creature.\n\nHan Sen summoned his gold raven beast soul and transformed. With his Blood-Pulse Sutra, he activated his nine gene locks.\n\nThe spider, seeing this other threat, then turned to fire webs at Han Sen. They were hopeless against him, though, as the webs were immediately incinerated by the bird\u2019s fire.\n\nHan Sen swooped in close to the spider, and with his talons, he cut the spider with a grizzly swing. Immediately, the spider began to gush green blood. Han Sen then spun around and fired a geyser of flame towards Disloyal Knight to free him.\n\nThe trapping web was scorched away, freeing him to do combat once again.\n\nFollowing this, Han Sen and the knight co-operated in attacking the spider. With Disloyal Knight\u2019s halo and Han Sen\u2019s volcanic assaults, the spider stood no chance.\n\nThere was no place for the spider to run or hide inside the cave. And within the hour, Han Sen was able to deliver the final blow, crushing its brain.\n\n\u201cSuper Creature Cruel Spider King killed. No beast soul gained. The flesh of this creature is inedible, but you may harvest its Life Geno Essence. Consume its Life Geno Essence to gain zero to ten super geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nAlthough there was no beast soul, Han Sen was still pleased with the result. He did not expect to receive a Life Geno Essence again, quite so soon.\n\nWhen the body decomposed, though, something else was left behind. It wasn\u2019t just the Life Geno Essence this time.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw what it was. It was a gold card, one emblazoned with the Nine-Life Cat emblem.\n\nThe card was red and around the size of a man\u2019s hand. On its back was the number seven.\n\nHan Sen examined it closely, but could not learn anything more. He had no clue why it had been left there, inside the belly of that spider.\n\nHe took the Life Geno Essence and walked around, wanting to ensure he had not missed anything. Han Sen eventually returned to Nest Shelter and asked Uncle Bug a few questions.\n\nThe answers he received were disappointing. The scariest place in the region was the nest he had just been to.\n\n\u201cAside from Thorn Forest and the water, is there anywhere else strange and treacherous I might venture?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen did not want to go to the water. The last time he was there, the fish king made all the creatures run off. In case he needed to traverse the banks of those wide rivers again in the near future, the last thing he wanted to do was provoke the kind inhabitants that had once respectfully provided him passage.\n\nThorn Forest was a mysterious place. It was wild and unpredictable, so without the safety net of his underground shelter, he wouldn\u2019t dare venture there.\n\n\u201cThere is still one more peculiar spot, here in The Forest of a Thousand Insects,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\n\u201cWhat place would that be?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nUncle Bug remained silent for a few moments, before telling Han Sen, \u201cThere are three small hills that skirt Thorn Forest. They are around five hundred meters tall, with a valley between them that is completely devoid of life. One dead spot, surrounded by the abundance of vegetation everywhere else in this land. Creatures have been known to wander in, but never wander out. And occasionally, you can hear the distant voice of a baby crying.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug went on to say, \u201cI\u2019ve been here all these years, and never once wanted to set foot in that place. What you might find there, I haven\u2019t a clue. But for what it\u2019s worth, I would advise against traveling there.\u201d\n\nHan Sen feigned agreement, but secretly thought to himself, \u201cThis is exactly what I wanted!\u201d\n\nHan Sen asked where that place was, so he knew where to avoid. His next trip was set."
