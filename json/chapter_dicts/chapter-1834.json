Having a planet to oneself should be a good thing, but Yisha\u2019s tone didn\u2019t make it sound as if it was.\n\n\u201cYou are my student now, so I will take care of everything. But if you have your own planet, that means you will have to be on your own. I cannot take part in its development, and you will have to pay taxes. The numbers aren\u2019t small, either.\u201d Yisha went on to say, \u201cNarrow Moon has a lot of planets, but the good ones have already been taken by the current Kings and Nobles. There aren\u2019t many left to choose from. Only the poor and cheap planets, really. If you don\u2019t do a good job, make a lot of money, and pay the necessary taxes, it is likely that people will start laughing at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a planet. I just want to be with you, and have you teach me,\u201d Han Sen quickly said.\n\nIt would be difficult for Han Sen to find a backer with infinite resources like her. Who would want to give it up in exchange for ownership and residence on a no-name planet that wasn\u2019t developed?\n\nYisha looked at him coldly, and she said, \u201cYou are Knife Queen\u2019s student. I cannot allow you to hide away from hardships. Besides, this is a law for the Rebate. You are required to go there. If you embarrass me, and you are unable to pay your taxes, I will deal with you myself.\u201d\n\nHan Sen feigned bitterness, and he said, \u201cQueen, I am just a Baron. I don\u2019t even have a helper. How am I supposed to develop a planet by myself?\u201d\n\nYisha laughed when she saw Han Sen\u2019s expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! You won\u2019t have to pay taxes for the first three years. It is only then that the taxman will come calling. Starting from the fourth year onwards, you will have to pay. The taxes won\u2019t be staggeringly high, but the amount you must pay will increase year after year. You are my student, so of course I can help you with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about the people. When you have ownership of a planet, you can recruit as many people as you want The Feathers have fallen, so many places are at war right now. It will be easy to nab a few of those.\u201d Yisha smiled.\n\nHan Sen did not want to go to those planets, but she wasn\u2019t going to give him a choice in the matter. This was something he had to do.\n\nLuckily, Yisha said she would still continue teaching him knife skills. It made him feel much better to know that she wasn\u2019t entirely letting him go.\n\n\u201cGhost Teeth Knife rejected me. Are his skills so talented it preferred him? But he is not of the Rebate, so how could he have learned the Teeth powers? It\u2019d be good for him if he was able to.\u201d Yisha watched Han Sen as he left, and she retreated into thought.\n\n\u201cNight River King, Black Steel and Han Sen received King class weaponry. They can both have a planet There aren\u2019t many decent ones remaining, so what would you like to do about this?\u201d An officer brought out a planetary chart and displayed it in front of Night River King.\n\nNight River King observed the chart and said. \u201cGive Black Steel Planet Scorpio.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanet Scorpio? That is a planet with many mines. There are a lot of rare metals there, and the ecosystem is diverse and balanced. Once upon a time, Rocks Fall Duke offered a grand sum in the hopes of its purchase. And you didn\u2019t accept his offer for purchase. Black Steel is a very lucky person.\u201d The officer laughed.\n\nNight River King smiled. \u201cBlack-Moon King is a blacksmith of the Rebate. Black Steel is talented and has a King knife. He will be something big, in time. Providing him with this planet will be beneficial for the advancement of our race. It won\u2019t belong to him totally, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d the officer said, with a bow. \u201cAnd out of the leftover planets, Planet Jadeshell is the richest. Shall we give it to Queen\u2019s student Han Sen?\u201d\n\nNight River King shook his head. \u201cI have matters to attend to there. Give him Planet Eclipse.\u201d\n\nThe officer, when he heard it, seemed stunned. \u201cMy King, there are no mines there! There is no water, and neither are there any plants. There are xenogeneics lurking there, and the weather is awful. Considering the number of xenogeneics that are there, it would be difficult for any Viscount to etch out a living. A planet like this is for an Earl or above. Wouldn\u2019t it be too cruel to give it to Han Sen?\u201d\n\nNight River King hummed, and he said, \u201cPlanet Eclipse may only have xenogeneics, but it is rich with them. He is lucky to receive this special treatment.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Night River King coldly laughed and said, \u201cHan Sen is not one of our kind. And his genes are not stable. We cannot afford to spend vast amounts of resources on him. If it wasn\u2019t for Queen, I wouldn\u2019t provide him a planet at all.\u201d\n\nThe officer gave a wry smile. Being sent to Planet Eclipse would be a far worse fate For Han Sen than being sent to a barren planet. Going to those poorer planets wouldn\u2019t be dangerous, but the same couldn\u2019t be said for Planet Eclipse.\n\nAccording to the laws of the Rebate, Queen couldn\u2019t directly partake in the development of the planet. Han Sen needed to hire people himself. If he was unable to recruit folks of Earl rank or above, even getting started would be a monumental task. Anyone who went to that planet would be in perpetual danger.\n\n\u201cWill Queen agree to this decision?\u201d the officer carefully asked.\n\n\u201cI am in charge of planetary distribution. She cannot say anything about it. And if the boy has a problem with it, he can forget all about it,\u201d Night River King said coldly.\n\nPlanet Eclipse?\u201d Yisha, seeing what Han Sen was going to be given, frowned sternly. Her urge to help Han Sen was now greater than she expected it to be, and resisting it was difficult.\n\nIf Planet Eclipse was owned by a Duke or a King, developing it wouldn\u2019t have been too hard. But you would spend so much to earn so little, so no Duke in their right mind would want to go there. It could be a treasure for Barons and Viscounts, but they wouldn\u2019t have what it took to develop the planet.\n\nPlanet Eclipse was like a flavorless rib of chicken.\n\nNight River King gave Han Sen Planet Eclipse to cause him trouble. That much was obvious.\n\nAnd when Yisha explained the situation to Han Sen, she told him, \u201cIf you do not want to go, it is fine. If you want, stay and learn some knife skills with me.\u201d\n\nYisha was too proud and arrogant to give up easily, but she didn\u2019t want to explain herself, either. If she told people she wanted to raise Han Sen up to be a Duke, the elites would probably help her. But Yisha\u2019s personality made her despise the act of explaining things. If people tried to stop her, she would be driven to accomplish her tasks all the more.\n\nAfter Han Sen heard about the planet he was to be given, though, his eyes shone. He bowed and said, \u201cQueen, I would like to go there!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Yisha looked at Han Sen with shock. She had already explained the state of Planet Eclipse to him, but he still wanted to go. That was a surprise."
