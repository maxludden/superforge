He was now writhing in his disbelief, which made him bleed even more.\n\n\u201cI am going to take the shelter. Didn\u2019t I already tell you that?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cDid the Xue family really ask you to come here?\u201d Xue Yucheng was looking confused now.\n\nOne man, accompanied by a little fox and a baby for backup, was going to waltz up and attempt to conquer a heavily-fortified castle. He thought Han Sen must have had a death wish, or at least an ardent desire to feel the insides of a creature\u2019s stomach.\n\nThis was a king class shelter, so it seemed unfathomable for a young man to so simply proclaim he was \u201cgoing to take it.\u201d\n\nXue Yucheng had been stuck in that shelter for a long time, so it was no surprise he had no idea who Han Sen was and what he had accomplished. Therefore, Han Sen thought it best if he showed the man what he was capable of, rather than wasting time explaining.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow me. I don\u2019t want you to get involved, and I\u2019d rather not have the master of this place think you betrayed him,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he quickened his pace.\n\nXue Yucheng was shocked, seeing how fast Han Sen and his allies were now going.\n\n\u201cBut this is a king spirit\u2019s shelter! Even if he is able to defeat the creatures, there\u2019s no way he can defeat the spirits that reside here,\u201d Xue Yucheng thought to himself, as he tried to keep his eyes on the speeding Han Sen.\n\nHe didn\u2019t think Han Sen would be able to get close. Even in the waters of the river that served as a wide moat for the shelter, there resided a large super creature. The old man thought it\u2019d gobble Han Sen up before he crossed.\n\nHan Sen did not hide his lifeforce, though. He wasn\u2019t planning on assassinating Blood River King and being stealthy with his approach. With the silver fox by his side, Han Sen had complete confidence in being able to tackle the shelter. He walked with a swagger, his body moving as if to say, \u201cCome and get some.\u201d\n\nBlood River Shelter only had four super creatures left, so Han Sen planned to kill them all at once and earn four Life Geno Essences. If he managed to get those, he believed he\u2019d be fully maxed out.\n\nUnless he encountered a being that had opened ten gene locks, Han Sen did not believe he\u2019d fight anything stronger than him, after that.\n\nBut when Han Sen came close to the shelter, the creatures started running off before he even had a chance to breach the walls. It was as if Han Sen was carrying a wretched disease or something.\n\nThe tentacle monster that resided in the river seemed to have disappeared as well.\n\n\u201cWhy are they all gone?\u201d After thinking this, Han Sen looked at the silver fox on his shoulders and remembered something. \u201cI remember now; when you\u2019re around, everyone runs.\u201d Han Sen was recalling their times in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nThe silver fox was a berserk super creature now, so not even super creatures would stay to challenge him.\n\nXue Yucheng was watching Han Sen as he went, and he was in utter shock. He thought everything would come out to attack the young man, but rather than do that, they all ran off in fear.\n\nXue Yucheng, seeing them run, could hardly believe what his eyes were telling him.\n\nHan Sen reached the main island without trouble. The monster with tentacles was a complete no-show.\n\n\u201cDid that super creature fall asleep or something?\u201d Xue Yucheng was amazed.\n\nAs strong as Han Sen was, however, the creatures were mainly just afraid of the silver fox.\n\nSeeing them all run off, Han Sen pulled out his swords and sprinted after them. He had to nab them all before they disappeared.\n\nXue Chen was watering the trees as this transpired. An alarm sounded, indicating something was attacking the shelter.\n\n\u201cWho in the sanctuaries would attack this place?\u201d Xue Chen said, with genuine curiosity. But he couldn\u2019t disobey his orders to check it out.\n\nStrangely, the creatures Blood River King owned were shivering. Perhaps it was because they were forced to go to the shelter\u2019s defense. Xue Chen saw the super creatures behaving in a similar manner, too, though. And this made him start to worry over his wellbeing.\n\nIf the sacred-blood creatures were that scared, the enemy had to be incredibly fearsome. If so, they\u2019d be merciless. And to Xue Chen, that meant he\u2019d not likely survive such a siege.\n\n\u201cI still need to deliver that item, though. I can\u2019t die yet!\u201d Death was also guaranteed if Xue Chen disobeyed his orders, though. The spirit would surely kill him if he abandoned his post.\n\nNo matter how slowly Xue Chen walked, reaching the gate was only a matter of time, anyway.\n\nXue Chen then caught sight of Blood River King and his other spirits approaching. Strangely, they did not look afraid.\n\nXue Chen saw three super creatures looking very annoyed.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of enemy can incite such a reaction within them?\u201d Xue Chen looked over to the Blood River then, and he saw a young man approaching. He had a fox and a little girl on his shoulders."
