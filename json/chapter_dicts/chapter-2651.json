    "text": "On a ship that was headed to the Andromeda system, a crystallizer woman turned to a man next to her. She looked afraid.\n\n\u201cAre you a crystallizer?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man said with a nod. He sounded rather cold.\n\nThe woman looked very surprised, and she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have met someone of the same race here. My name is Lydia. You took the hall\u2019s quest to venture to the Andromeda system to hunt xenogeneics, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man answered. His emotions didn\u2019t seem perturbed at all.\n\n\u201cThat is great. Can we combine forces and do it together?\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cNo, we cannot,\u201d the man answered.\n\nThe woman seemed disappointed, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I guess. What is your name, anyway? Can we exchange phone numbers? There are too few crystallizers here. We can contact each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we cannot,\u201d the man said. His face remained impassive.\n\nThe woman had spoken nicely to the man, but the man hadn\u2019t reciprocated by the smallest amount. He never gave her a reply that was greater than three words.\n\nAfter they arrived in the Andromeda system, the ship\u2019s passengers spread out as they headed to the various planets. The man got off the ship while the woman followed after him.\n\n\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d the man asked, turning around and looking at Lydia strangely.\n\n\u201cIt is because, in this universe, a crystallizer woman meeting a crystallizer man is a one-in-a-billion chance. I don\u2019t want to miss out on such a rare opportunity. So, please, tell me your name,\u201d Lydia responded, lowering her head and mumbling quickly. She spoke in a volume that only dogs could have discerned.\n\n\u201cYi Dong Mu,\u201d the man finally spoke his name.\n\nLydia looked very happy to hear that. She raised her head, wanting to tell Yi Dong Mu something. But as she opened her lips, before she could speak, Yi Dong Mu\u2019s dagger slammed through her heart.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2026 why\u2026\u201d Lydia couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. She stared at Yi Dong Mu with shock. She couldn\u2019t believe the man would do something like this to her.\n\n\u201cIt is because I sense something dangerous within you.\u201d Yi Dong Mu pulled his dagger back out of Lydia, sending the woman stumbling to the ground.\n\nHe looked at Lydia\u2019s body, then turned around. He left and disappeared someplace into the mountains.\n\nShortly after Yi Dong Mu left, the lifeless Lydia opened her eyes. Weird flashes passed through her eyes, and she stood up like a wooden doll.\n\nAt that moment, Lydia looked like a lifeless robot. Her eyes were wide open, but they had no focus. It was like lots of data was scrolling through her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt failed again. Such a heartless killer. He killed a beautiful woman of the same race simply because he sensed danger. It is so hard to deal with this guy.\u201d After a while, Lydia spoke to herself. \u201cSo annoying! I have now failed eight times trying to get close to this target. Another team failed to gain any information from him, as well. It is so hard to get information from others who have been in contact with Han Sen before. Since when did the crystallizers become so strong? It looks like this investigation will become quite difficult.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Lydia\u2019s body suddenly collapsed on the ground. Her light faded, and she looked like a dead body again.\n\n\u201cBrother King, has anything special happened to you recently?\u201d Wang Yuhang looked at his phone while chatting with Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cI made some new friends,\u201d Xie Qing King said, with a cigar hanging from his lips. He was reclined in a CEO chair. He looked really relaxed as he spoke.\n\n\u201cMe, too. But it looks like something happened with Han Sen. Is he in big trouble or something?\u201d Wang Yuhang said.\n\n\u201cMaybe not. Maybe they are just keen on investigating the boy. Otherwise, the people coming to ask us questions wouldn\u2019t be so gentle.\u201d Xie Qing King squinted while he spoke.\n\n\u201cThen, what are we going to do?\u201d Wang Yuhang asked.\n\n\u201cIf someone is giving you free money and beautiful women, are you ever going to say no? It would be very rude, and you would be missing out. That would sadden the person making the offer. Of course, we aren\u2019t going to do that.\u201d Xie Qing King laughed.\n\n\u201cTeehee! That is what I thought, too. Lin Feng, Tang Zhenliu, and the others, as well. Can you please get in touch with them? Me being here is not a coincidence.\u201d Wang Yuhang laughed.\n\n\u2026\n\nEvery day, Han Sen remained near the lake and continued fishing out pages of the Xuan Yellow Sutra. For some reason, whenever it was Bao\u2019er\u2019s turn, she always ended up with actual treasures, and every time Han Sen fished, he ended up with a sheet of paper belonging to the Xuan Yellow Sutra.\n\n\u201cThis is so f*cking weird. Why can I only retrieve this geno art, page by page?\u201d Han Sen wondered. He couldn\u2019t think of an answer.\n\nAfter all, anti-material worlds were difficult to explain. Common sense and logic didn\u2019t really apply to such places, and Han Sen didn\u2019t want to waste time mulling it over. He just wanted to gather all the pages of the Xuan Yellow Sutra as fast as he could. He was keen to find out what sort of geno art it was.\n\n\u201cA geno art that comes from the anti-material world. No matter how bad it is, it must be special, right?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nSuddenly, the triangle symbol on the small jade figure glowed. Han Sen knew Exquisite was on her way over. He carefully synced his thoughts with the small jade figure.\n\n\u201cFind anything?\u201d\n\nMoments later, Exquisite teleported right next to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cYes, but I did not get any fish. The stuff I\u2019ve been collecting is pretty weird,\u201d Han Sen with a strange tone of voice.\n\n\u201cUnderworld Lake is connected with the anti-material world. It is normal to fish up odd things. What did you get?\u201d Exquisite asked.\n\n\u201cI got some paper,\u201d Han Sen said slowly. Liyu Zhen had seen these yellow sheets of paper before, so there was no use in hiding it. He had no choice but to reveal what he had found.\n\n\u201cPaper? What sort of paper?\u201d Exquisite asked with curiosity. Although anything could show up in Underworld Lake, it was rare to get something like paper.\n\n\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Han Sen was frozen. When he thought about the lewd content on the yellow pages, he didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nExquisite could sense what Han Sen was thinking. So, she blushed and said, \u201cNever mind. You don\u2019t have to tell me. Whatever you get from Underworld Lake belongs to you. Even if you collect a deified treasure, it is all yours. When you leave Outer Sky, you can even take them with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Han Sen pretended to be relieved.\n\n\u201cI thought you always wanted xenogeneic resources. I have found some for you already. How much you get will depend on your power, though,\u201d Exquisite said to Han Sen. She appeared rather mellow.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked, curious.\n\n\u201cOuter Sky has a star tree. The tree produces star fruit, and it is surrounded by powerful space xenogeneics. They are King class, at least. Of course, some can even reach deified. Now, you can collect the star fruit, but how many you can collect will depend on you.\u201d"
