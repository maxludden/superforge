The rock of that place was far sturdier than they could have imagined.\n\n\u201cLittle red bird!\u201d Han Sen called.\n\nThe little red bird understood what Han Sen wanted to see from it, so it shot out its phoenix fire to burn the rocks around the purple copper jian.\n\nSurprisingly, it took half an hour of constant flames before the rocks even started to be affected. They began to turn red. If Han Sen tried to use the phoenix fire to melt the rocks into molten juice, God only knew how long that might take.\n\nGu Qingcheng looked at the burning rocks and said, \u201cThe Black Hole Spider has consumed many planets and stones. The spider must have eaten many high-class metals and special materials over the years, but its digestive system has failed to break down some of them. Anything that cannot be digested has come together to form these stones. If these rocks have withstood the digestive system of the deified Black Hole Spider, it\u2019s easy to imagine how frighteningly strong this material might be. An ordinary deified won\u2019t have an easy time damaging these deified stones.\u201d\n\nElysian Moon nodded to show agreement with what Gu Qingcheng just said. The Black Hole Spider was a deified xenogeneic that was at the butterfly rank. If a monster like the spider couldn\u2019t digest a material, then Han Sen\u2019s people wouldn\u2019t be able to break it down either.\n\nFortunately, the little red bird could slowly burn its way through the stones. With effort and patience, a clump of steel could be ground into a needle. Clearly, those were the qualities that they needed here: effort and patience.\n\nAs the little red bird was still spewing its blazing fires, another gale of wind erupted from the purple copper jian. That wind scattered the phoenix fire everywhere, blowing it back across Han Sen and the others. Many pained screams erupted.\n\nThe little red bird stopped spewing its phoenix fire, but it was too late. The flames had already left hair and eyebrows blackened and singed. They weren\u2019t badly injured, though. They just looked a little haggard now.\n\n\u201cThis purple copper jian keeps releasing gales of wind. We can\u2019t burn through the rocks to get to it. Is there another way?\u201d Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and the others.\n\nEveryone swapped glances with each other, but no one could come up with any ideas.\n\n\u201cThen, we will try to take it one by one,\u201d Han Sen said. He summoned his peacock king soul robe and walked up to the purple copper jian. A rainbow light covered his hands as he tried to pull out the weapon.\n\nThe jian\u2019s mysterious patterns glowed with purple light, and then a scary storm flared from the purple copper jian. It blew everyone away.\n\nHan Sen held onto the jian. He lodged his feet against the rocks, and he tried to pull the purple copper jian free. After trying his hardest, though, he couldn\u2019t get it to budge. If anything, the storms of the jian became even stronger. It made Han Sen\u2019s feather robe and hair billow.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen could no longer withstand that scary storm, so he was blown away. He bounced off a few rocks, but the wind was so strong that it continued to push him until he was thrown out of the cave.\n\nA while later, Han Sen flew back in. The storm in the cave had finally calmed down.\n\n\u201cNing Yue, give it a try. Maybe you\u2019ll have greater success,\u201d Han Sen said to Ning Yue.\n\nNing Yue shook her head and retreated a step. She said, \u201cIf you guys cannot do it, then I surely cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust give it a shot. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll throw you to the snakes,\u201d Han Sen threatened.\n\nThat storm wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. It would toss them around, but it wouldn\u2019t kill them.\n\nNing Yue had the protection of her green sword. The storm didn\u2019t harm her. Perhaps she would be able to truly pull out the purple copper jian.\n\nNing Yue felt awful. She was so scared, but after Han Sen\u2019s threat, she reluctantly moved forward. Slowly, she placed her hands on the purple copper jian.\n\nPang!\n\nNing Yue only had to touch the jian for the scary storm to return and blow her away. The power of the green sword didn\u2019t protect her this time. Ning Yue rolled around for quite some time before coming to a stop.\n\n\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to try, and yet you forced me!\u201d Instead of getting up, Ning Yue sat where she had landed, her hair a jumbled mess. She almost cried.\n\nHan Sen felt a headache coming on. No one there was able to pull out the jian. Normally, if a treasure seemed to be truly unobtainable, Han Sen would leave it be.\n\nBut now, if he didn\u2019t take that purple copper jian, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take out the monsters. They would be trapped in this cave. That was a miserable thought.\n\n\u201cDad, do you really want that purple copper jian?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, tugging on Han Sen\u2019s sleeves.\n\n\u201cYes, we need that purple copper jian. Do you have any ideas?\u201d Han Sen asked Bao\u2019er happily.\n\n\u201cJust pull it out,\u201d Bao\u2019er said.\n\n\u201cIf we were able to pull it out, we wouldn\u2019t be standing here doing nothing,\u201d Elysian Moon said.\n\nNing Yue cried and said, \u201cYes, this thing is so weird! When you touch it, the wind comes and it cannot be repelled.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er blinked and jumped toward the purple copper jian. She reached out her hand to grip the jian\u2019s handle. As she did, everyone readied themselves to weather the storm. They didn\u2019t want to get blown away again.\n\nBut after Bao\u2019er\u2019s little hand grabbed the handle, no storm came. Bao\u2019er held the purple copper jian tightly and then pulled it out as if she was unearthing a carrot. The purple copper jian hadn\u2019t shown any indication that it would move for anyone else, but it slid out easily in Bao\u2019er\u2019s grip.\n\nNing Yue and the others stared with wide eyes, unable to believe Bao\u2019er was able to do what she had just done.\n\nBao\u2019er pulled out the one-meter-long purple copper jian completely. It turned out to be taller than her. She delivered it to Han Sen and smiled. \u201cThere you go, Dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, you are so good. Dad will buy you ice cream later.\u201d Han Sen took the jian, a wide grin stretching his mouth.\n\nStrangely, when the jian was below the rocks, it would unleash storms whenever it was touched. Now that Han Sen was holding in his hand, there were no storms.\n\nHan Sen looked at the purple copper jian. It was the same as the one he viewed through his Purple-Eye Butterfly. It was 1.2 meters long, its blade was square, and it was crafted out of some sort of purple copper. It was quite heavy. On all four sides of the tool, there were strange symbols.\n\nBut those weird symbols were different from the strange symbols on the handle. Han Sen tried putting his power into the purple copper jian to see if he could activate it.\n\nIt was a surprisingly smooth process. After the power of the Dongxuan Sutra entered the purple copper jian, its symbols lit up. Then, it glowed with purple light.\n\nHan Sen was pleased to see the light shining from the activated weapon. If he couldn\u2019t use it after retrieving it, that would be very frustrating. It seemed as if he had worried too much about it.\n\nThe purple symbols on the jian lit up. Everyone in the cave could feel that the jian\u2019s true power wasn\u2019t actually wind. It didn\u2019t resemble the power that had been released from its handle, at least.\n\nBuzz!\n\nThe jian\u2019s purple light grew stronger, then slowly transformed into purple flames. The purple copper jian became enshrouded in fire, and the intense purple fire followed Han Sen\u2019s hand and started to spread across his body."
