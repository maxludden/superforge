But before that, I would like to speak with Exquisite alone.\u201d Han Sen went to see Sky Palace Leader and started explaining the reason for his visit.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to say to her?\u201d Sky Palace Leader squinted his eyes in the direction of Han Sen. He knew Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were the same. Convincing men like them of anything wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cI would like to discuss the terms and conditions of me accompanying the Very High. I\u2019m an eleven armor talent genius, after all. It\u2019s okay for me to strike a bargain that will suit me, right?\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\n\u201cTell me what you need. There is a team in Sky Palace that can fight for the best terms and conditions to benefit you.\u201d Sky Palace Leader didn\u2019t believe that Han Sen just wanted a better deal.\n\n\u201cThere is one aspect of the deal that needs to remain private. Don\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing. I won\u2019t do anything that will cause you trouble,\u201d Han Sen said seriously.\n\n\u201cFine. Go home for now, and I will establish a private meeting for you.\u201d After Sky Palace Leader said that, he allowed his eyes to linger on Han Sen for a while. And then, he said, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to go, though, you don\u2019t have to. I can deal with the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have decided to go. I thought about it some more, and I figure that it isn\u2019t a bad deal. It will take one and a half years for me to recover. If I go there, I can save at least a year. And I will be given lots of goodies. So, why not?\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nAfter Han Sen left, Sky Palace Leader looked at Yu Shanxin and asked, \u201cDo you think he is really going to go to the Very High?\u201d\n\nYu Shanxin bowed. \u201cLeader, I cannot guess how Han Sen\u2019s mind works. But I don\u2019t think he is a liar. I don\u2019t think he will crap all over Sky Palace, given how we have treated him, and I don\u2019t think he means us harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that, too. But this little guy does cause us a lot of trouble. He\u2019s kind of annoying,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said as he rubbed his temples.\n\n\u201cWho isn\u2019t annoying when they are young?\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile.\n\n\u201cYou are right. You should go and get ready yourself. After reaching the Very High, your safety comes first. Do what you can, and don\u2019t push yourself further than that,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said.\n\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Yu Shanxin bowed.\n\nHan Sen arrived back on his little jade island, and a Sky Palace butler came to see him shortly after. The man told Han Sen that Exquisite was going to meet him at the Sky Water House that night.\n\nHan Sen followed the butler to the Sky Water House. Exquisite was there, as expected. She was sitting atop a staircase that led down into a pond. Her feet were in the water, displaying the pale skin of her legs.\n\n\u201cTell me what you want. Do you want xenogeneic genes, treasures, or geno arts?\u201d Exquisite asked, her expression unreadable. On her face, not a single human-like emotion was visible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any of those things,\u201d Han Sen said to her, sitting down next to the pool. He took off his shoes and rolled up his pants. Just like Exquisite, he allowed his legs to dangle in the water. A cooling sensation rushed against his feet, prompting Han Sen to shiver in pleasure. It was like eating ice cream in the summer.\n\nThe water in Sky Water House wasn\u2019t ordinary water. It was blue water, and it was filled with energy. It was able to quicken the growth of cells and aid in the rejuvenation of one\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d Exquisite looked curiously at Han Sen, who was sitting next to her.\n\nExquisite had given up on Lone Bamboo and selected Han Sen. Aside from Han Sen\u2019s talent and power, the most important motivator was the fact that Li Keer had chosen Dollar.\n\nDollar had once beaten Lone Bamboo in the Geno Being Scroll. And Exquisite and Li Keer had both seen Dollar\u2019s power. If she chose Lone Bamboo, he would always be compared to Dollar. That wouldn\u2019t be much better.\n\nLi Keer had a ten armor talent. Exquisite had a nine armor talent. So, Exquisite didn\u2019t want a silkworm that was inferior to Li Keer\u2019s. That was why she was taking a risk by going for Han Sen.\n\nIf Han Sen really had an eleven armor talent, then her silkworm would be better than Li Keer\u2019s. If Han Sen\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t great, she would only lose once. But this way, at least she would have a chance to win.\n\nHan Sen looked at Exquisite. After a while, he laughed and said, \u201cYou can use me. But you need to be better than me. Why would I follow someone who is inferior to me? Don\u2019t you think there is sound logic to that thought?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Exquisite said. She wasn\u2019t angry.\n\n\u201cIf you think this is right, then it is settled. If you can convince me, I will follow you to the Very High. If you cannot, can you leave me and Sky Palace alone?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Exquisite answered with haste. She sounded very confident.\n\nHan Sen looked at Exquisite with interest. \u201cHow are you going to convince me?\u201d\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen calmly and asked, \u201cWhat is your best geno art?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnife skills, I guess.\u201d When Han Sen was Han Sen, he used knives the most.\n\n\u201cThen let us compete with our knife skills.\u201d Exquisite reached out her hand. A stream of water rose into her palm in a serpentine swirl, then formed itself into a knife. \u201cI will sit here, and you can attack me. If you can make me stand up in one hundred attacks, you win.\u201d\n\nExquisite was very confident, which was evident in the way she had chosen to fight with a water knife. She hadn\u2019t even stood up. Han Sen smiled. He reached out a hand toward the pond. He sucked up some of the water to form a water knife of his own.\n\n\u201cSure. One hundred attacks is the limit. Let us see who stands up first,\u201d Han Sen said to Exquisite with a smile.\n\n\u201cPlease, go ahead,\u201d Exquisite said without argument.\n\n\u201cIn my home, ladies always go first. After you.\u201d Han Sen wanted to see Exquisite\u2019s real power.\n\nHan Sen had traveled with Li Keer and Exquisite for a long while, but he was never able to accurately gauge their real power.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Exquisite answered. She didn\u2019t hesitate to attack Han Sen with the water knife.\n\nShe didn\u2019t apply much strength, so the knife didn\u2019t make much sound as it slid through the air. But even so, Han Sen felt a chill at the sight. Her knife was coming for his head. Her hand appeared to be moving in a smooth arc, but Han Sen felt as if he couldn\u2019t see where the knife was coming from. It was as if the water knife adhered to the rules of some strangely shifting space.\n\n\u201cGood knife skill,\u201d Han Sen complimented her. He swung his own water knife, using Teeth Knife\u2019s Fang."
