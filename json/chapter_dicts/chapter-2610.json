    "text": "Han Sen\u2019s knife skills kept changing, and thus far, he had used seventy different attacks. Not a single one managed to hit Exquisite. Her floating water knife was able to block every single strike.\n\nTo an ordinary person, Exquisite would seem like some unknown god. No matter how many times Han Sen attacked, Exquisite controlled her water knife with perfect finesse. She blocked every attack like a prophet.\n\nBut in Han Sen\u2019s eyes, Exquisite wasn\u2019t some omniscient being. Her reactions made sense.\n\nThat was because Exquisite had merged with the universe. Han Sen\u2019s movements would trigger the spinning of universal cogwheels, and whenever this happened, the disturbance in the universe would alert Exquisite and prompt her to react.\n\nSo, when Han Sen attacked, Exquisite was able to respond instantaneously. It was like Han Sen was attacking a mirror. It didn\u2019t matter how he used his knife; when the water knife touched the mirror, the reflection of the water knife would react and nothing would happen.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Han Sen stopped moving. He sat still. His water knife suddenly pushed forward, and a water silk appeared next to Exquisite. Almost a hundred water silks manifested like a horde of blades around Exquisite\u2019s body.\n\nThe Sky Palace skill called Under the Sky made every slash Han Sen had performed thus far into a water silk. They all appeared at once, and Han Sen was on the verge of breaking the enemy\u2019s defense.\n\nA water knife couldn\u2019t block that many knife silks unless Exquisite used her body to fight back. She either had to do that or move her body to evade them.\n\nOf course, the water knife in front of Exquisite moved. But it exploded under the force of all those incoming water silks. The water silks were like a net of knives coming down on Exquisite.\n\nExquisite, however, didn\u2019t move. She was like a jade goddess, still seated atop the stairs. Her jade feet were still comfortably dangling in the water. Holy, but cold.\n\nThe knife net was only a few inches away from her by this point, and then, it suddenly came to a standstill. Each silk froze in front of Exquisite, and there they remained unmoving.\n\nExquisite reached out her finger to pull the knife net. And then, the knife net came undone like a water stream. They all folded in on each other, gathering in her hands. They merged to become a giant water knife.\n\nThat water knife still contained Han Sen\u2019s power, but it was no longer under his control. Exquisite held onto it gently, cradling it like it was a delicate toy.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes were electric. He stared at Exquisite\u2019s water knife. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Area to watch Exquisite\u2019s movement.\n\n\u201cShe can play like this?\u201d Han Sen thought happily.\n\nHan Sen could see that Exquisite was able to mess with the cogwheels of the universe. His Dongxuan Area was more useful at this than her ability, though. Han Sen felt as if he learned something.\n\n\u201cIt is pointless to continue this futile effort. Let us end this exercise here,\u201d Exquisite said coldly. Her hands looked like they were touching a flower as she flicked the handle of the water knife. Then, the water knife flew toward Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen wanted to generate another water knife to continue fighting, but he noticed that all the water in the pond was moving toward that big water knife that was headed for him. The water knife flew extremely slowly, but the closer it got, the more power it contained.\n\nHan Sen was forced to generate another water knife. But when he struck the giant water knife, he was unable to break it. Han Sen\u2019s water knife blended in with the giant water knife to become a part of that giant water knife.\n\n\u201cNo wonder the Very High are the number one race in the universe. She is good. Not many deifieds can manipulate the laws and rules of the universe to please their desires. And Exquisite is merely a ninth-tier King.\u201d Han Sen sighed. Han Sen had only complimented her slightly, though. He wasn\u2019t planning on giving up. He watched as the water knife gathered all the water in the pond to itself. It was like a giant blade that had risen to cut the sky. Han Sen\u2019s eyes flashed, and suddenly, he swung his hand like a blade. He used his body to fight back the knife.\n\nExquisite had her yin and yang tai chi eye, but she was still surprised to see this. That giant water knife\u2019s power was combined with Han Sen\u2019s seventy strikes of Under the Sky, in addition to her own powers. It had been buffed by the universe itself, too.\n\nThat strike was starting to form substance chains. It wasn\u2019t like a real deified\u2019s attack, but it was better than what most half-deifieds could achieve.\n\nAnd Han Sen clearly intended to use his flesh to take the blow instead. Exquisite believed that was too dangerous to do.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t hesitate. His hand-blade struck the water knife, and the scary water knife suddenly fell under Han Sen\u2019s control. It now followed Han Sen\u2019s attacking stance, returning toward Exquisite.\n\nPang!\n\nThe scary water power was now in front of Exquisite. An invisible wall rose to block it, then exploded and fell back to the pond. The explosion shook Exquisite, sending her stumbling backward.\n\n\u201cYou cheated!\u201d Exquisite said, standing up. She looked at Han Sen\u2019s hand. In between his fingers was a crystal orb. It was Ancient Water God\u2019s Ancient God Origin.\n\nAncient Water God\u2019s Ancient God Origin was a water-element relic. If Han Sen held that item, not even water deifieds could harm him. And Exquisite was just a ninth-tier King.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t cheating. I was just making reasonable use of my resources. If that is considered cheating, is it not cheating for you to use your third eye and receive the boons and benefits of the universe?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThat is my power. What you used was another person\u2019s power,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cWith my power, I don\u2019t think I would lose, either. But I\u2019m heavily injured, so it wasn\u2019t as if you were challenging me at my full strength. Even if you won, I wouldn\u2019t concede,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nWhen Exquisite heard that, she fell silent. She closed her tai chi eye and looked more like a person again.\n\nAlthough Exquisite\u2019s face was still rather expressionless, she looked far more like a human being than she had previously. With her third eye open, she was like a lifeless machine.\u201cSure. I will wait until you heal so we can fight again, then,\u201d Exquisite said while looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThen you are going to have to wait a long time. My wounds will take at least a year to fix. Maybe two or three years.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\nExquisite frowned. She knew that Han Sen was injured and his body was heavily damaged. She knew he wasn\u2019t lying. She was being too hard on him.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, I have heard the Very High have a spring that brings good fortune. It can reverse one\u2019s luck and allow others to be reborn. Is that true?\u201d Han Sen squinted his eyes as he looked at her.\n\n\u201cYes. Do you want to use that spring to repair your body?\u201d Exquisite knew what Han Sen was thinking.\n\n\u201cIf you want to fight me again soon, I am afraid that is the only way,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come to the Very High, how can you use the spring to fix your body?\u201d Exquisite frowned.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t go to the Very High. However, until you beat me, can I keep my body free from your intrusion?\u201d Han Sen finally spoke his true purpose."
