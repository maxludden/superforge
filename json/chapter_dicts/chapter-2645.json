    "text": "When Exquisite returned to the wooden house, she frowned. It seemed that Han Sen had already left. The further away from her that Han Sen was, the weaker her connection with him became. Now, she could only sense what direction Han Sen had gone off in and get a faint feel for his current state of emotion.\n\nAll Exquisite could tell was that Han Sen was feeling happy. She couldn\u2019t really feel anything other than that.\n\nBut if he felt happy, that meant he hadn\u2019t encountered any trouble. And that suggested she didn\u2019t have to worry about him too much.\n\n\u201cHe is quite daring. He\u2019s just arrived in Outer Sky, and yet he has already run-off so far on his own. Doesn\u2019t he realize how many deified xenogeneics there are roaming around? Even if he uses his deified treasures to bolster his power, it will still be hard for him to survive out there amidst those ancient monsters,\u201d Exquisite thought to herself.\n\nHan Sen was getting close to the wooden house now, and as he approached, Exquisite was able to sense more and more about him. After an hour, she could sense that he was holding a bunch of flowers.\n\nBut Exquisite could only feel and not see, which was a shame. She could sense how careful Han Sen was being to hold the flowers without crushing them, but she couldn\u2019t see what he was seeing. So, she could only guess what he was holding by judging his sense of touch.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s happiness ran through her. It seemed that he might have already discovered a treasure of some kind.\n\n\u201cFairy flowers,\u201d Exquisite realized, when Han Sen was finally close enough for her to detect what he was thinking about. Han Sen had collected fairy flowers. He didn\u2019t know how to use them, though. So, he was bringing the flowers back to ask her what they were for.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Exquisite couldn\u2019t believe Han Sen had somehow managed to find fairy flowers. Those flowers were quite unusual. Many of the Very High wanted fairy flowers, but the strange plants were incredibly rare.\n\nHan Sen had only been in Outer Sky for two days, and already he had come across fairy flowers. This really was so weird. Since Exquisite still couldn\u2019t see Han Sen with her own eyes, she didn\u2019t believe Han Sen had discovered real fairy flowers, though. He must have been mistaken about what he had. But when Han Sen appeared in her vision, Exquisite\u2019s eyes opened wide.\n\nHan Sen was holding real fairy flowers, and not just one, but several. There were seventeen individual flowers on the plant. Fairy flowers only opened a single bloom every hundred million years. There were seventeen flowers here, so that meant the plant had been alive for 1.7 billion years.\n\nAcross the whole history of the Very High, 1.7 billion years wasn\u2019t very long. But it was very rare to find a fairy flower that had been growing for that length of time.\n\nEven if someone was lucky enough to find a fairy flower, it usually only had two or three blossoms. In the Very High Palace, there was a very old fairy flower that had 72 blossoms on it. That number of blossoms seemed to be the maximum that a fairy flower could achieve. The plant had never grown any further. That flower was called the Fairy King Flower, and it was the Very High\u2019s most important flower.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fairy flower had 17 blossoms. That wasn\u2019t a bad sum. If he was able to grow it and keep it alive, it could help him a lot. \u201cWhy did you run out there all alone?\u201d Exquisite asked when Han Sen had returned to the yard.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d go check out the neighborhood. And look, I found a strange bunch of flowers. Do you know what these things do?\u201d Han Sen asked, holding out the fairy flowers as if he had just stumbled upon them. He didn\u2019t mention the trade he had conducted with the God Spirit Touch.\n\nAlthough Exquisite knew that Han Sen wasn\u2019t saying something important, she still listened to what Han Sen told her. Then, she answered, \u201cThat is a fairy flower. If you can grow it, it could very well become a true god class plant xenogeneic. But it grows incredibly slowly. It will only produce one flower every one hundred million years. Once it has 72 flowers, it will become a butterfly. Whether it can become a true god after that will depend on its luck and power.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Exquisite looked at the plant in Han Sen\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThe plant you found has 17 flowers. It should be half-deified already. If it produces one more blossom, it will become deified.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred million years per flower? Right now, there isn\u2019t even another bud. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t live long enough for it to grow its 18th flower,\u201d Han Sen said with a sardonic smile. One hundred million years was far too long for him to wait. No human had a lifespan that long.\n\n\u201cMaybe not. Fairy flowers don\u2019t show signs of their growth. When the time comes, a new blossom will simply sprout overnight. Maybe this plant is very close to having another flower already,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cWhat use are the flowers, anyway?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Exquisite told him, \u201cThe flower has multiple uses. It can be used to produce medicine, but unless the medicine was direly necessary, no one would use it for that purpose. Instead, people prefer to transplant the flowers into their own gardens. The presence of the fairy flower helps nearby plants and creatures to develop. Having a fairy flower in close proximity can also boost one\u2019s lifeforce and add to one\u2019s lifespan. And, after a while, the fairy flower will attract God King Bees. That is what yields the greatest benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat benefit is that?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked.\n\n\u201cAfter a God King Bee eats the nectar of a fairy flower, it will become drunk and slump down underneath the fairy flower,\u201d Exquisite said. \u201cIt is about ten thousand times easier to take out God King Bees that way. If this plant can become deified and attract deified God King Bees, that would be fairly awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I need one more flower before that happens. I don\u2019t know when it will grow that 18th flower,\u201d Han Sen mumbled, his voice a little dull. He felt as if his luck was far inferior to the luck of others. He only needed one more flower. If he could attract deified God King Bees and kill them easily, that would be a great boost to his development.\n\nExquisite could sense that Han Sen was feeling a bit disappointed, and so she said unsympathetically, \u201cYou can still attract half-deified God King Bees, which isn\u2019t too bad at all. It is a very good resource for you at your current level.\u201d\u201cI have a few geno arts. Take a look and tell me if you want one. If you would like a different geno art, feel free to tell me.\u201d Exquisite placed a few books down on Han Sen\u2019s desk.\n\nHan Sen picked up a few of the books and perused them. One of them, which Han Sen had already practiced, was God\u2019s Wander. But Han Sen hadn\u2019t known it was called God\u2019s Wander. He thought it was just a good space teleportation technique.\n\nAside from God\u2019s Wander, there was an assortment of knife skills, punching techniques, and a geno art called Very Real Body. Very Real Body was a geno art that strengthened a practitioner\u2019s body. If he practiced it very well, he would be able to use his body to block any physical attack. Even deified elites wouldn\u2019t be able to harm him.\n\nExquisite had obviously selected these geno arts based on her interpretation of Han Sen\u2019s character. They were all skills Han Sen would be very good at. It seemed as if Exquisite had gone through a lot of effort to find them.\n\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Han Sen greatly appreciated her kindness.\n\n\u201cThese are only what my silkworm deserves. You just need to keep practicing. If you are lacking anything, make sure to let me know,\u201d Exquisite coldly said.\n\nAfter pausing, Exquisite glanced at the text for Very Real Body and said, \u201cThis copy of Very Real Body is only the basic version. It is suitable for people who haven\u2019t yet become deified. If you can become deified, I can get you the rest of this geno art, and you can become deified with it. Very Real Body can be practiced all the way to butterfly class. It is a geno art that reinforces your body. I noticed your body was strong, so I thought you might as well try it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen agreed with her. He accepted the geno arts she had brought him and planted the fairy flowers in the garden. He was going to wait until the God King Bees came, so he could kill them with ease."
