He thought, \u201cIt looks like Deep Abyss Knight already combined with the universe\u2019s god body by a god. His presence and scabbard are so similar, and the scabbard was made from a broken god personality. That means he is the scabbard\u2019s master. He must be that Sky Armor God.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder God told me not to bring out the scabbard when facing Sky Armor God. That is why. But that heads-up was fairly useless. How was I supposed to know when and where Sky Armor God would fight me? I could not hold off on using the scabbard forever. With that being the case, what is the point in owning the scabbard in the first place?\u201d\n\nAfter guessing Sky Armor God\u2019s identity, Han Sen was not keen on standing down. He continued looking at Sky Armor God, who was doing the same.\n\nSky Armor God was holding the scabbard. Although he resonated with the scabbard because it was man-made, recovering his body with it would still take some time and tricks. Furthermore, Sky Armor God did not want to open his chest in public and fit his bone back inside.\n\nFor now, Sky Armor God only held the scabbard. The purple and black flames on his body kept burning as he looked at Han Sen.\n\nIt was not an option for him to take the scabbard, concede, and leave the space battleground. That was impossible. Gods had the dignity of gods. Even if Sky Armor God wanted to leave, he had to leave as the victor.\n\n\u201cBecause you took my god personality, this is your unlucky day \u201d Sky Armor God stared at Han Sen. He raised the scabbard and looked at him with disdain. \u201cAs your reward for returning the scabbard, I will allow you to die by the scabbard.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Sky Armor God waved his arm. The scabbard carried a scary purple and black knife light. It came straight for Han Sen.\n\nThe knife light acted as if it was splitting space in half. It was so powerful that it made people\u2019s hearts tremble. When seeing this slash, the expressions on the faces of many deified xenogeneics changed.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body quickly flashed away. He had dodged the knife light. When it appeared again, it was on the other side of space.\n\nGalaxy Teleportation. Han Sen had practiced his teleportation abilities for a long time. He had finally practiced Galaxy Teleportation, but Han Sen had only studied a part of it. He modified Space Teleportation into a version that was more suitable for his body.\n\nBecause of the Dongxuan Aura\u2019s power buff, Han Sen\u2019s Break Space Flash was faster than God\u2019s Wander. He used Space Teleportation as a normal teleportation talent. It was even faster than short-distance teleportation.\n\nNo one expected Han Sen would be able to dodge that slashing power. Sky Armor God waved the scabbard again. He swung it at Han Sen. This time, it was stronger and faster. It suddenly ripped space to appear directly in front of Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was able to flash away, so the knife light missed its target.\n\n\u201cHow many attacks are you able to evade?\u201d Sky Armor God coldly asked. He started slashing with the scabbard at an even faster pace.\n\nSky Armor God slashed a dozen times. Each slash was faster and harder than the one before. He was slashing out many purple and black space cracks, which were like deep trenches in the vastness of space.\n\nEven so, not a single one of them was able to damage Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThat is a very fast space teleportation skill. It seems faster than the Very High\u2019s God\u2019s Wander. This Dollar is not an easy fellow to beat.\u201d Sky Palace Leader was shocked by the performance.\n\n\u201cGod Spirit combined body,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat power can challenge a true god class and perhaps something even stronger. Dollar\u2019s Space Teleportation speed can dodge the striking attacks. That is very rare. It is a shame that evading attacks is ultimately pointless. He cannot go against the Sky Armor God and slay a god. He will lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing against the Sky Armor God and slaying a god is not easy. If this was Golden Growler, he might stand a chance of beating the enemy.\u201d Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cDollar\u2019s body fitness is strong, but he is still only butterfly class. If he could become a true god, perhaps he could stand a chance.\u201d\n\nAll the elites of every race understood Han Sen\u2019s situation. Relying on the unlimited Space Teleportation, he was able to dodge the Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s attacks. But who knew Space Teleportation itself cost energy? To keep using Space Teleportation like that meant he would eventually run out of power. Once that happened, he was going to lose.\n\n\u201cDollar\u2019s Space Teleportation is very powerful. It looks like he can use it whenever and however he wants. He does not need to prepare time for it, and he can keep using it to move. That is stronger than the Very High\u2019s God\u2019s Wander.\u201d The Extreme King\u2019s Second Uncle profusely complimented the talent.\n\nBai King looked at the space battleground without speaking. His eyes looked strange. He felt a bit angry. \u201cA God Spirit has descended to earth. He took the Deep Abyss Knight\u2019s body. They are getting more ballsy.\u201d\n\nBai King recognized Sky Armor God. After all, his power had been able to combine with the Return Empty Scabbard. It was too easy to guess the identity of the villain.\n\nIt did not matter who was king of the Extreme King at the time. Any of them would have despised Sky Armor God. The same applied to Bai King. If he was able to strike, he would want to be like Knife King and cut out Sky Armor God\u2019s bones again.\n\nSky Armor God thought Space Teleportation required a lot of power. All he had to do was slash a few more times to make Han Sen exhausted. When he could no longer use Space Teleportation, he could kill him.\n\nHan Sen kept using Space Teleportation without reprieve, and he was showing no signs of slowing down. That surprised Sky Armor God.\n\nIn fact, it was not just Sky Armor God who was surprised. Even God, who was in the garden, was surprised. \u201cHe is continuously using Space Teleportation, yet his body does not look like it is getting tired. It is not just his body that is strong. His body keeps drawing in energy from the universe to keep his energy reserves full. The Very High can barely do something like that even if they max out Sky and Men Combined Together. He is just a butterfly and can already do this. Is it a simple talent, or has he practiced it a lot?\u201d\n\nOrdinary deified creatures were afraid of using too much power, but Han Sen had four battle bodies that were combined. The Dongxuan Battle Body was able to keep on absorbing energy directly from the universe. It kept providing him with energy. If Han Sen\u2019s body did not collapse, he could fight endlessly. He did not have to worry about exhaustion.\n\nSky Armor God saw the problem. He coldly grunted. \u201cIn that case, I will make you stop hiding.\u201d\n\nThe scabbard slashed out like a shadow. Many knife lights created a crack in space. He was going to trap Han Sen inside a space crack.\n\nSpace Teleportation was actually a space movement. If Sky Armor God cracked the space around Han Sen, he would be totally disconnected from it. Even if Han Sen had his powerful Space Teleportation skill, he could not escape it.\n\nHan Sen kept teleporting. More cracks were showing up in space, so there were fewer places for him to teleport to.\n\nThe space battleground was not the real universe. It was just an area of space. Its power was limited. Han Sen did not have enough space to move around freely.\n\nHan Sen did not expect to keep running around forever. Teleporting was a way for him to observe. He wanted to learn about Sky Armor God\u2019s power. He did not know anything about Sky Armor God. People needed to know their enemy, so Han Sen had to learn about Sky Armor God.\n\nHan Sen had slain two gods. He did not mind doing it again, but he needed to make sure it was a success. He could not blindly attack and end up dying.\n\n\u201cWhere are you running to?\u201d Sky Armor God kept slashing. Purple and black knife lights kept cutting space up, producing the scary space cracks.\n\nHan Sen was now surrounded by space cracks from all directions. He was trapped in the sole area that had not been broken, but space there was cut off from the outside. No matter how strong Han Sen\u2019s Space Teleportation was, he could no longer teleport away.\n\nIn Blood Legion, Lou Lie looked at Sky Armor God with fire. He recognized who Sky Armor God was. \u201cIt is over. Dollar is strong, but fighting a god is too much. It was a shame it was not me encountering this god. Otherwise, I might have been able to kill him.\u201d"
