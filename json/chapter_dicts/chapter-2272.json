    "text": "Creatures in the geno universe only had one soul, but Han Sen\u2019s Sea of Soul held many beast souls. Since each silver sycee could only freeze one soul at a time, Han Sen used eight beast souls to neutralize the sycees.\n\nHan Sen played with a silver sycee in his hand and stroked the blood kirin\u2019s head. He looked at Mister White and said, \u201cWhich way should we head now?\u201d\n\nMister White went silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what these palaces are made of, but not even Fox Queen could force one open. We have to travel around the palaces using their installed teleporters. Each palace seems to possess four teleporters. The front gate and each of the side halls have a teleporter. The back hall has one, too. That means every palace has four exits. What we don\u2019t know is how many palaces there are. I think there might be a way to find the right path to the leader\u2019s hidden stash, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re very good when it comes to calculations and restrictions, Mister White. You must have the answer.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cI have a few ideas, but I cannot be certain my assumptions are correct. We can give them a try, however,\u201d Mister White said, then he turned to the back hall.\n\nCrime followed Mister White, and Han Sen and the kirin brought up the rear. Just as Mister White had explained, the place was practically a maze. Han Sen wasn\u2019t very good with these sorts of puzzles, and it would have been very difficult for Han Sen to find the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure by himself.\n\nIf he walked around aimlessly, he would probably never find the treasure. And if he bumped into Fox Queen, that one encounter could be the end of him.\n\nMister White teleported out via the back hall. When Han Sen stepped out of the teleporter on the other side, he found himself in a big hall. The hall was just like the one Han Sen had come from. There were many statues and paintings there.\n\nMister White made a calculation, and he went to the side hall\u2019s teleporter.\n\nHan Sen wondered just how many palaces there were. This maze was far too complicated for him to navigate by himself. Mister White made a calculation every single time they reached a new palace. It took them four hours to move through one hundred palaces, and they still hadn\u2019t reached the end.\n\n\u201cHow long is it going to take for us to reach the treasure?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but ask.\n\nCrime snorted in annoyance and said, \u201cDo you think calculating the right route is easy? If it wasn\u2019t for Mister White leading us down the correct road, we would be teleporting into the wrong palaces and exposing ourselves to a great deal of danger. It wouldn\u2019t simply be a long trip, at that point. We would struggle to survive whatever trials those other palaces threw at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t complaining. I was just wondering how long it will take for us to get to where the treasure is hidden,\u201d Han Sen said in exasperation.\n\nMister White laughed and said, \u201cIf I\u2019m guessing correctly, we\u2019ll be reaching the first checkpoint soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen asked. This was the first he\u2019d heard about a checkpoint.\n\nAfter thinking briefly, Mister White said, \u201cEven with us going down the correct road, there will be a few defensive systems that we\u2019ll have to bypass. For a treasure like this, there will be multiple protective measures in place. Our path is correct, yes, but we must also open the many locked doors to gain entry. I estimate that there will be four to seven of them. I don\u2019t know exactly what form these \u2018checkpoints\u2019 will take, of course. The defensive systems will be a touch more threatening than actual locked doors. We have to tread carefully.\u201d\n\nAfter saying all that, Mister White returned his focus to the path ahead. Han Sen followed the man silently.\n\nAfter going through another three palaces, Mister White arrived at a palace\u2019s main gate. It was there that he told Han Sen, \u201cIf I\u2019m correct, the next palace will be the first checkpoint of this maze. You are going to have to be a little bit more careful.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Mister White traveled through the light. Crime followed him, as well.\n\nThe bird\u2019s nest was still sitting on Han Sen\u2019s head, and he also summoned the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema before walking through the light.\n\nJust like before, Han Sen appeared in a palace after teleporting. This palace looked far different from the other hundred palaces they had visited, though.\n\nThis palace was circular, and the roof was shaped like a shield. A giant statue stood at the center of the hall, looking like some massive god that was clad in protective armor. Its head almost touched the roof above. Even though it was just a statue, the mere sight of it was terrifying. Looking at it made the observer want to submit to this deific figure, as if he was the center of the entire universe.\n\n\u201cIs this a statue of the Sacred Leader?\u201d Han Sen wondered, as he observed the statue.\n\nFox Queen had told him that the Sacred Leader always wore armor, and no one knew for sure whether it was a man or a woman.\n\nMister White and Crime had stepped out of the teleporter, but they did not go forward. When Han Sen and the blood kirin caught up with them, Mister White said, \u201cAlthough it looks safe, we still need to exercise caution. The correct exit here is the front gate. We will have to walk past the statue.\u201d\n\nMister White stepped towards the statue, but Crime quickly ran in front of him. \u201cI will ensure the path is safe for you first.\u201d\n\nHan Sen really admired Crime. There were not many people left in that day and age that could remain so loyal and committed.\n\nHan Sen followed Mister White, while Crime led the way from ahead. As they approached the statue, the statue\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.\n\nThe eyes gleamed like lanterns, showering the entire statue with light. Han Sen\u2019s group was suddenly standing in a spotlight.\n\nBut while the light was bright, it didn\u2019t seem to be destructive.\n\n\u201cHello children, welcome to my treasury,\u201d the statue boomed. Han Sen jumped slightly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. This statue is only an extension of my will. It is not really me.\u201d The statue then went on to say, \u201cIf you\u2019ve made it this far, then that means I am already dead. The items here are now useless for me. I can give them to you, but first, you must pass a test. Only those that successfully pass the test will be allowed to claim my treasures. Anyone who fails, even if they are a deified being, will not be permitted to take so much as a single grain of sand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat test?\u201d Crime asked.\n\nThe statue\u2019s voice was robotic. There were no emotional fluctuations in its tone, and it was impossible to guess its gender. It said, \u201cThis test is very simple. If you can break this, you will pass the test.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the statue moved. It reached out its hand and bent lower. It put an item in front of the group, then returned to its original position.\n\nThe statue\u2019s eyes started to dim, and its appearance reverted to that of an ordinary statue.\n\nHan Sen looked at the item the statue had placed in front of them; it was a forty-centimeter-long rock. It didn\u2019t really look special in any way, and it was made from green stone.\n\nCrime tried talking to the statue again, but the statue didn\u2019t respond to his questions.\n\n\u201cStop asking. It only has preprogrammed responses. Now that he is gone, there is nothing special about the statue,\u201d Mister White said."
