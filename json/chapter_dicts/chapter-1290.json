And if my eyes really aren\u2019t playing tricks on me, please tell me there\u2019s a good reason for your presence here. Last I recall, you weren\u2019t the fondest of company one could keep.\u201d Han Sen was surprised, seeing the mini lady.\n\nBack in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary, the Empty Witch had used the Empty Vine to access the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary. That was the first and last time Han Sen had met her, and it followed hot on the heels of a grueling adventure. The circumstances of their first encounter were not very pleasant, that was for sure.\n\nEmpty Witch stuttered to say, \u201cWell, can I just be the first to congratulate you on your accomplishments? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve managed to take down as many emperor shelters as the tales tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the first. And for all you know, I just got a little lucky. I caught one emperor when he was napping,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nEmpty Witch proceeded to tell him, \u201cIf you think these attempts at a jest are charming, I can only admit that you are gravely mistaken!\u201d\n\nHan Sen merely smiled and said, \u201cJokes aside then, come on; tell me why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Holy Baby Fruit is going to ripen soon. Miss Lotus wants every emperor to try it. You may not be a spirit, but you\u2019re an emperor all the same. Because of this, she has extended you a very special invitation,\u201d Empty Witch explained. Then, after a brief pause, she jumped to ask, \u201cWhere is the Holy Spirit?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Han Sen plainly stated.\n\nJi Yanran had joined an aircraft expedition, along with Bao\u2019er.\n\nEmpty Witch looked disappointed, but she moved forward to ask, \u201cCan you bring her here? I would very much like to see her.\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er is too busy to come right now. Anyway, keep explaining,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing. Ugh, I don\u2019t know why I came all this way.\u201d Empty Witch rolled her eyes.\n\nHan Sen said, \u201cWhy is the Lotus Empress being so kind as to invite us all to eat this fruit?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly Baby Fruit is an emperor-class geno plant. Only she can grow these, and every ten thousand years, she invites emperors from all across the sanctuary to taste them. It\u2019s your lucky day, it would seem,\u201d Empty Witch finished saying.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything in response. It was a very strange proposition, one Han Sen thought to be a little fishy.\n\nPlus, if he went, he\u2019d be a sole human venturing into all-spirit territory. It could have been a trap. Even if he was to consider going, he knew he\u2019d have to take many precautions.\n\nEmpty Witch could see the expression of doubt lurking behind Han Sen\u2019s cold facade, and she tried to bring him ease by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; there are many people there who despise each other. In the shadows of Evil Lotus Shelter, though, none would dare cause a scene. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoger that, but\u2026 I think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t going to willingly place his life in the hands of others and take someone like her at her word. Normal geno fruit no longer worked on Han Sen, and if Lotus Empress was willing to issue it out as a gift, he didn\u2019t think it could be anything all that special.\n\n\u201cI suspected you might look upon such an event with suspicion, and I\u2019d wager that is because you don\u2019t know really know what this whole thing is. But don\u2019t worry, I have a sneaking suspicion of my own. A suspicion that suggests you will change your mind.\u201d Empty Witch then threw something to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen examined the item and noticed it to be a lotus flower.\n\n\u201cThis is her invitation. I suggest you ask your spirit buddies what Holy Baby Fruit is; I\u2019m sure you are more inclined to believe them than me. And once you change your mind, this is your ticket.\u201d Empty Witch paused, and then with bright and glittering eyes, jumped to say, \u201cBring the Holy Spirit, too. I still want to meet her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m off now to go visit another emperor and hand him his invitation. He\u2019s a grumpy fellow, but thankfully, they don\u2019t shoot the messengers. Anyway, Mister Han Sen, I implore that you take the time to ask around and think about it.\u201d Empty Witch then swiftly flew away.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Empty Witch was able to sneak inside the shelter without being detected\u2014she was good.\n\nBecoming this strong in such a short time meant Lotus Empress must have been quite something. Empty Witch didn\u2019t seem particularly special, yet her empress had trained her extremely well.\n\nHan Sen asked his companions about Holy Baby Fruit and whether or not Lotus Empress could be trusted.\n\nThis event had been going on for a long time, and it was confirmed to be safe. No deaths or dangers had ever been reported as occurring there before, either. Every Holy Baby Fruit bestowed upon someone gave them one self geno point. And emperors had actually received two at the last event.\n\nAnd one Holy Baby Fruit, out of all the ones to be given out, possessed a Holy Baby inside. If you were lucky enough to receive that one, you could open a gene lock.\n\nIf you had already opened ten gene locks, you could open the door and become a demi-god. Forty-thousand years ago, an emperor ate the Holy Baby and immediately became a demi-god.\n\nThere were three thousand fruits up for grabs, though. Getting the right one was sheer luck.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she eat the fruit herself, then?\u201d Han Sen found it too good to be true.\n\nHan Sen thought only a crazy fool would hand-out such wondrous gifts willy-nilly.\n\nDry Bone King, the source of Han Sen\u2019s information, explained, \u201cThe legends say it is because she is unable to eat them. Instead of letting them go to waste, though, she charitably hands them out. Pretty much every emperor has tasted her fruit, and it kind of means they owe her one in return. It\u2019s a way for her to earn respect more than anything. If spirits want more fruit, they must maintain their pleasantness with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nBaby Ghost told Han Sen, \u201cSome berserk super creatures receive invitations, too. And while you hold that invitation of hers, you won\u2019t be provoked when you\u2019re out and about. Unless you go looking for a fight and start one, of course.\u201d"
