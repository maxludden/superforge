    "text": "But for Han Sen, that was ideal. After what happened with Night River King, who knew if other assassins might be lurking outside the base with Ancient Warrior Statues, just waiting for their chance to kill him.\n\nThe tri-colored Demon Bug King Bai Sema had been heavily damaged. Only Han Yan\u2019s gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema was currently usable. If the same thing happened to them again, they\u2019d have nothing left to repel such a horrible attack.\n\nStaying inside the shelter of the base under the constant protection of the knights was currently Han Sen\u2019s best option.\n\nThese thoughts lasted until the Ji family returned the diary to him.\n\nThe Ji family\u2019s code crackers were quite skilled. After they managed to decode the diary, they translated Night River King\u2019s messages in short order.\n\nThe content started before Night River King came to the systems of chaos, and the early entries were rather boring. They were only a few words each, and they tended to be simple notes about his day. He probably only wrote them in code out of habit.\n\nWhen Night River King arrived in the systems of chaos, however, he was attacked by xenogeneics while he was defending Ice Blue System. That was where the diary got interesting.\n\nNight River King hadn\u2019t been there for long, but in that time, he discovered something rather strange. Instead of telling the Ice Blue Knights, he began secretly investigating on his own.\n\nSixty-seven days before Han Sen began reading the diary, Night River King had been spending his second day stationed defensively at the edge of the Ice Blue System. A group of xenogeneics had approached the border of the Ice Blue System and attacked the Ice Blue Knights that were on guard.\n\nThen Night River King had made this note:\n\n\u201cIt was here. It was always here.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t make much sense. Han Sen didn\u2019t know exactly what it meant, but it clearly indicated that Night River King had found something.\n\nHan Sen kept looking through Night River King\u2019s diary. He noticed that over the following days, each entry was short.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still here. Purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeventh is infected. Haven\u2019t found anything abnormal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-second is infected. Nothing abnormal.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cFirst is abnormal. Observation ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe short entries continued for an entire month. Night River King seemed to have discovered something, and although his entries were short and mostly without emotion, Han Sen could sense the worry that had filled Night River King as he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat did he find that scared him so badly, I wonder? What are his notes talking about?\u201d Han Sen wondered with a frown. He didn\u2019t have any answers yet.\n\nThe diary continued in that way for some time. The entries led up to a few days before Night River King had come and attempted to kill Han Sen. At that point, the diary included something new.\n\n\u201cEdward asked me to kill Han Sen. It is risky, but it is worth a try. If I succeed, I can be away from it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned again. Night River King knew helping Edward would be a dangerous venture, but he was scared of this mysterious thing even more.\n\nOver the next few days, Night River King continued his observations. He still referred to \u201cit\u201d and the numbered creatures frequently. Those numbered creatures had undergone many weird changes.\n\nThe day before Night River King came to kill Han Sen, he wrote his last entry. He had seen something that shocked him a lot.\n\nHis last entry was much lengthier than the others. What was written there made Han Sen feel an uneasy sense of disbelief.\n\n\u201cGood god. Seventh became King class\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 It affected number seven\u2026 What is that power? Is it dangerous? Can I use it?\u201d Night River King seemed very nervous, and he used many question marks.\n\n\u201cWhat did Night River King see? What are these numbers he\u2019s referring to? It can raise creatures to King class? If it is inside the Ice Blue System, and Night River King saw it so regularly, there\u2019s no way that it has escaped the notice of all the other Ice Blue Knights.\u201d Han Sen frowned as he thought to himself. But Night River King\u2019s diary never once described exactly what \u201cit\u201d was. And so, Han Sen couldn\u2019t accurately guess its nature.\n\n\u201cPurple. Night River King found it, but the Ice Blue Knights with him did not. He said it affected a number of creatures, and one of those became King class\u2026\u201d Han Sen sorted through the various leads, but there was nothing solid enough to go on.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I will have to go to where Night River King was originally stationed. If I head there, I might be able to find out what he is referencing,\u201d Han Sen proceeded to think. It was simply a shame that the Ice Blue Knights owned every inch of the system. He couldn\u2019t just go wherever he wished.\n\nHan Sen used Night River King as an excuse to ask for more information about the borders of the system. In the time that Night River King had been with the Ice Blue Knights on the border, none of them had ranked up from Duke to King class.\n\nHan Sen had thought that the numbers might have indicated the Ice Blue Knights that were working with Night River King, but that seemed to have been an incorrect assumption.\n\n\u201cWhat are these numbers referencing? If I can just figure that out, they shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find,\u201d Han Sen said with a groan.\n\nNight River King\u2019s final diary entry was very intriguing to Han Sen. If the mysterious \u201cit\u201d could raise another creature to King class, then Han Sen was very interested in finding out what it was.\n\nBut since it had terrified Night River King to such a degree, it was probably quite dangerous as well.\n\n\u201cHow do I get to where Night River King was stationed as a guard?\u201d Han Sen tried to think of a way to get there, but no ideas seemed to stick.\n\nHan Sen needed to get to the very edge of the Ice Blue System, and only proper Ice Blue Knights were allowed to fill those posts. Han Sen was just a back-up knight, so he wasn\u2019t qualified for the position. He wouldn\u2019t receive permission to go, even if he really wanted to.\n\nPlus, Han Sen didn\u2019t think going there on his own would be a good idea. Edward would find a way to deal with him in order to retrieve that tablet. And Edward could definitely take advantage of such a place.\n\nBut being stuck in the base, unable to discover what Night River King was talking about, left Han Sen with an itchy feeling.\n\nIf the thing was as dangerous as Night River King indicated, there was every chance it was a threat to the entire Ice Blue System. Han Sen was included in that threat, as well.\n\nA back-up knight knocked on Han Sen\u2019s door. \u201cHan Sen, Knight King has asked you to meet him at his office.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I will be there,\u201d Han Sen said, waving his thanks. He got up and went straight to Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s office. He had no idea why Ice Blue Knight King had summoned him."
