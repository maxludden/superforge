    "text": "\u201cMister Liu, I thank you. You have greatly opened our eyes,\u201d Chen Hu said.\n\nHe believed the beasts were so kind because of Liu Yuxuan\u2019s behavior.\n\nWith a forced smile, Liu Yuxuan pretended that had been the case and said, \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Liu, when we return to the Alliance, we will send you a reward in return for your kind deeds. But if I may ask, where do we go from here?\u201d Lin He knew it wasn\u2019t actually Liu Yuxuan who had made the beast king so friendly, but he was still oblivious to his evil thoughts and intentions. So, he just went along with his credit-taking and thanked him.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s me. Helpful as always.\u201d Liu Yuxuan smiled and went on to say, \u201cThere is a path you\u2019d do well to take, just up ahead. Come, I will lead you there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, in that case, we thank you again,\u201d Chen Hu said.\n\nLiu Yuxuan then turned to ask Han Sen, \u201cHave you seen the Blood-Wing Beast King before?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nLiu Yuxuan had no reason to believe Han Sen was lying.\n\n\u201cIs this guy the luckiest man in existence or what? Why would this brat be given a blood fruit?\u201d Liu Yuxuan did his best to contemplate why.\n\nLiu Yuxuan forced another smile and tried to weasel his way into getting a nibble of it. He said, \u201cThat blood fruit is a gift for everyone; why don\u2019t you share it?\u201d\n\nCheekily, having not received it, he tried to lie and say it was something that belonged to everyone.\n\nIf Han Sen was willing to share, it meant he\u2019d be given a slice. With a fruit so brilliant as that, even a small nibble would be wondrous.\n\nIf Han Sen was not willing to share, others might end up upset. They might even revolt against the man they all seemed to be blindly following.\n\n\u201cI gave it to Bao\u2019er.\u201d Han Sen pointed at her.\n\nLiu Yuxuan had only focused on Han Sen the entire time, not noticing Bao\u2019er was munching away at the fruit as its juice stained her cheeks.\n\n\u201cHow could you?!\u201d He was unable to hold his tongue and feign kindness at this point, and like a sudden barking, he yelled at Han Sen.\n\nHe was infuriated to learn that Han Sen had fed a fruit that was greatly desired by a king spirit to what he deemed a useless pet.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nHan Sen had actually tried having some earlier, but it had no effect.\n\nWhen Bao\u2019er showed him she really wanted it, he had no problem giving it to her.\n\n\u201cLet her have it. We don\u2019t need it, anyway,\u201d Chen Hu said.\n\n\u201cThe beast king provided it to Han Sen as a gift. It was his to decide who should or who should not receive some,\u201d Lin Weiwei spoke out, in defense of his decision.\n\nShe could tell Liu Yuxuan hadn\u2019t actually helped them, as well. If the king had really been nice to them because of his kowtowing, the fruit would have been given to him.\n\nSeeing that he had lost his temper this way, Lin Weiwei was now positive her hypothesis was correct.\n\nWith everyone else also saying they did not mind not having it, Liu Yuxuan was again left struggling to comprehend why everyone was so supportive of Han Sen.\n\nSeeing Lin Weiwei looking at him, Liu Yuxuan tried to swallow his flaring temper and gently explain, \u201cIt can merely benefit the human body, that\u2019s all. I just thought it was a shame to give it to a pet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I treat her like a daughter, anyway,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cFine. Whatever. Let\u2019s keep walking.\u201d Liu Yuxuan marched ahead as soon as he finished his sentence.\n\nLiu Yuxuan went with a smile, but inside, he was thinking, \u201cF*ck! That\u2019s it; I\u2019m not allowing any of you to live. That *sshole Han Sen must die.\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan despised Han Sen more than ever, and the fact he had ruined his plans was driving him nuts. He wanted them all dead, especially since they had seen him shamelessly kowtow in front of a super creature.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t told anyone which shelter he actually came from, fortunately. But regardless, he wasn\u2019t going to allow anyone there to walk away and possibly mention the shameless act they had seen from him.\n\nBut these thoughts and desires were all manic concoctions of his disturbed mind. No one thought anything ill of his behavior so far. They actually appreciated his willingness to go down on the ground in a subservient manner before the beast king. They might not have known his true intentions, but still, that was besides the fact.\n\nRight now, though, Liu Yuxuan was leading them to a dead end. They were headed to the territory of another super creature. It was another place the king spirit would not dare tread.\n\nCompared to the Blood-Wing Beast King, this super creature was ten times more ferocious, Liu Yuxuan reckoned. It was known to kill and gorge on whatever living thing came near its lair. Not even the bones of its victims would be left uneaten.\n\nWhen they were almost there, Liu Yuxuan stopped and pointed in the direction, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t lead you any further. Beyond is where you should head, and not soon after, you\u2019ll be led away and off the mountain. Be careful on your way, lest you make your presence known to the king spirit.\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan was lying, of course. The super creature was said to lurk directly ahead of the party now. He had no actual clue where the mountain\u2019s exit might have resided, and he had no idea what was past the doom-bringing beast he was leading them to. Not that it mattered to him.\n\n\u201cMister Liu, wait.\u201d After everyone thanked him for his guidance, and he was ready to turn away and leave, Han Sen stopped him from going."
