The Sky Tree hasn\u2019t even fully recovered yet,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nPang!\n\nSky King leaped down, his stomp creating a deep hole in the ground.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the *sshole right now. Ugh, why did I ever trust you?\u201d Han Sen used his phoenix techniques to dodge Sky King, who was going to try to stomp on him next. He was going to attempt another escape.\n\nBut suddenly, many golden palaces began to fall from the sky. And as they clobbered the area all around, in great ruin and catastrophe, Han Sen felt as if he had stumbled into a post-apocalyptic landscape left to the faint whispers of dust and echoes.\n\n\u201cWhoa, he is an emperor! This is his Sky Palace technique. It\u2019s fueled by a Space element. Unless we kill him, we\u2019re trapped!\u201d Dragon King cried aloud.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s phoenix techniques were incredibly quick, and he bobbed and weaved between the tumbling palaces that fell to break the landscape with great speed. But it seemed as if there was no end to them, and no matter how far he went, it felt as they were being drawn to him.\n\n\u201cIs there any way for us to stop it?\u201d Han Sen knew there was no point in being angry with Dragon King now. They were both in a dire situation, and co-operation would yield the best results.\n\nHan Sen looked behind him and saw Sky King fast approaching. Each of his footsteps was painting the ground gold as he went. Sky King spared no time in throwing a punch towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen fell back, trying to dodge the strike, but he felt as if his speed was slower than it ought to have been. He discovered it wasn\u2019t that his speed had slowed down, it was the dimension itself that had been stretched for him.\n\nThe distances were stretched to become ten times longer, so Han Sen was not evading any slower, he was just having to travel further.\n\nSky King\u2019s punch might have looked very slow, but he could transcend the warping of the dimension and make it seem incredibly quick.\n\nWith this play on space, Han Sen was unable to dodge the strike. He had no choice but to try and meet Sky King\u2019s fist with his own.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fingers cracked in the collision, and it felt as if they were on the precipice of breaking. The power of the fist he went up against hurled him backwards.\n\nEver since obtaining super king spirit mode, things had never been so dire for Han Sen. Rarely was he placed in a situation so dangerous that he could not escape.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen went flying back, crashing into the sturdy walls of a golden palace. The building began to collapse, and Han Sen shook his head, slinging blood over the remaining walls.\n\nBefore he could get up, though, Sky King was already upon him. He was primed, ready to deliver another cruel punch.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?! Run!\u201d Dragon King exclaimed.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s perception of reality had been warped, as the dimension he inhabited was altered. He was unable to dodge.\n\nBut suddenly, a holy beacon of light burst forth from Han Sen\u2019s forehead. A figure appeared, wielding a transparent greatsword. It was a woman, with blonde wavy hair and white wings. Immediately, she went to strike Sky King.\n\nDong!\n\nSky King\u2019s fist had met its match. The power was negated, but the strength still managed to knock Little Angel away. She crashed into Han Sen, sending them both flying backwards even further.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Dragon King called out.\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Han Sen silenced the Dragon-Blood Ring, feeling like an idiot for having trusted Dragon King so much.\n\nLittle Angel had the strength of a super king spirit, but she was not as strong as an emperor.\n\nSeeing Sky King approach, Han Sen kicked up a coinfall to stop him. Owing to its suppressive abilities, they were both able to escape and recompose themselves. But the coins, as they landed on Sky King, didn\u2019t actually seem to do much. They merely dropped on him like actual raindrops, doing little to slow him down.\n\nHan Sen had figured this might be the case, but he did not have the time to build up a Saving Money hit. Sky King was able to command the very dimension they inhabited and bend it to his will.\n\nIf Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit had opened ten gene locks, he might have been able to fight him, but alas, that was not the case.\n\nHan Sen and Little Angel waged war against their foe, each letting out a flurry of punches and swordstrikes.\n\nAs valiant as it sounded, the reality of their battle was not half as grand. Sky King was able to use one hand to block each of their attacks, and he was able to do so with no trouble or strain.\n\nDisloyal Knight, in the meantime, was still engaged with the golden peacock. His armor had been severely damaged by this point, and he was bleeding continuously.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt as if he ought to have been able to block the next punch to come his way, but again, the dimension was given a shake. The punch effortlessly landed upon his chest again.\n\nHan Sen was sent flying. Not only did he break a number of palaces, but he also broke a few ribs.\n\nLittle Angel could not dodge the punch she was delivered, either. That sent her flying backwards, too. Han Sen went to catch Little Angel, and as he did, he thought about escaping by using his Night Cloak.\n\nAfter moving forward to catch Little Angel, she paused in his arms. Then, she turned around and kissed Han Sen upon the lips.\n\n\u201cI know you love me, but let\u2019s save this for a more appropriate time.\u201d Han Sen tried to mask his surprise.\n\nBut the moment they kissed, Little Angel became a figure that was formed entirely of white light. Then, she entered Han Sen\u2019s body and became one with him.\n\nHan Sen felt rejuvenated, as if he had been gifted a vast amount of power, the likes of which he never thought he\u2019d be able to wield. His head was dressed with a gold halo ring, while his back sprouted wide angel wings. Then, a new weapon spawned in his hand\u2014the transparent greatsword.\n\nRoar! Han Sen roared to the skies, as a new power surged through his being. It combined with his cells to make changes to his body."
