I want the Sea Sky Eye, but not as much as the Extreme King do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind trying to get it. The Extreme King might not be strong enough to take it down anyway,\u201d Han Sen said flippantly. But inside, he was thinking about how he was going to get his hands on the Sea Sky Eye.\n\nWhen Dia Robber finally returned, the royal knights still hadn\u2019t found the Sea Sky Eye.\n\nClearly, the Destroyed had spotted the royal knights scouring the system for the Sea Sky Eye. When he saw them, he asked in surprise, \u201cWhy are the Extreme King here?\n\nDragon One explained the situation to him, and in response, Dia Robber said, \u201cIf the Extreme King believe they are going to get it, I doubt there will be much for us to do in this system. I have spoken to my people. Dollar, they have agreed to allow you to learn Big Destroyed as a reward for helping us slay a deified xenogeneic. I can\u2019t give you part of the geno art as a downpayment, though. We are hoping that you will help us defeat the deified xenogeneic before receiving the reward, and in the event that you don\u2019t trust us, we can give the Big Destroyed to a trusted third-party to hold onto. The third-party will pay you after the deified xenogeneic has been slain. What do you think of that, Dollar?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Let the Dragons hold onto the geno art, then,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI thought of that as well. I would like to ask you to help us, Dragon One.\u201d Dia Robber looked at Dragon One as he spoke.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d The Dragon promptly agreed.\n\n\u201cI have brought Big Destroyed here with me. Should we sign the agreement now?\u201d Dia Robber asked, presenting a little box.\n\n\u201cThere is no rush. Let me finish-off this Sea Sky Eye, and then I will sign.\u201d Han Sen waved his hand.\n\nThe people around him were shocked. No one had expected that Han Sen still intended to defeat the Sea Sky Eye after learning of the Extreme King\u2019s interference.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, the Extreme King are very strong. Plus, they are very confident in their task here. They must have made special preparations, and they will have tricks up their sleeves. There is no need to fight with them over this,\u201d Dragon One said, attempting to persuade Han Sen to drop the matter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to try my luck. I have nothing against Bai Wan Jie.\u201d Han Sen paused, and then went on to say, \u201cIn regards to signing the contract, let us wait until this has been resolved first. You guys probably shouldn\u2019t stick around. Why don\u2019t you leave for now? When I\u2019m done here, I will contact you both.\u201d\n\nDragon One and Dia Robber looked at each other with apprehension, and then they took their people and left.\n\nThe Dragons were frequent allies of the Extreme King. Although the Destroyed didn\u2019t often see eye to eye with the Extreme King, they also didn\u2019t want to risk a falling out with such a powerful race. So, they thought it was a good idea to leave now, as well.\n\nAfter Dragon One and Dia Robber left, Han Sen spoke to Li Keer and said, \u201cYou should leave, too. If I get the Sea Sky Eye, I will deliver it to you.\u201d\n\nLi Keer smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not as strong as you, but I do have Galaxy Teleportation. I\u2019m perfectly capable of getting myself out of trouble, if need be. You just mind your own business without fretting over my wellbeing.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had no response for that. He merely proceeded to wander around the system, slaying xenogeneics as he went. He seemed to be meandering aimlessly, but he carefully stayed within the borders of the system.\n\nIf the intruder had been anyone else, Bai Wan Jie would have sent his people to chase them away. The crown prince wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to hover around him like a vulture. But Han Sen\u2019s performance against the Gold Armor General had been terrifying. It made others fearful of him.\n\nAlthough the Extreme King\u2019s royal knights had an impressive reputation, they weren\u2019t confident that they could defeat Han Sen in the core area. Instead of attempting to oust him, they sent scouts to watch him and attempt to contain him, if need be.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t feel guilty at all about his plan to steal from the Extreme King.\n\nHe had expected to wait a long time before the Sea Sky Eye was found, but it was only two days later when he felt a scary shockwave rolling out from a distant spot in the system. Bai Wan Jie must have discovered the Sea Sky Eye, and he was in the process of killing it.\n\nHan Sen wanted to travel there, but two royal knights barred his way.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d a royal guard said while looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to tell you where I\u2019m going?\u201d Han Sen asked icily.\n\nThe royal knight wasn\u2019t angered, but his face remained impassive as he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me where you\u2019re going, but if you are headed for the battlefield, then you will become an enemy of the Extreme King. I hope you think this through.\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen could speak, the other royal knight said, \u201cOur crown prince said that if you are willing to stay here and not interfere in the fight, he will owe you a big favor. We would appreciate it greatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will not go. Please tell the crown prince not to break his promise,\u201d Han Sen said. Then he turned around to leave.\n\nBoth of them were shocked. When they were sent there, the two knights had been ordered to stop Dollar no matter what. They were prepared for a fight to the death, but Dollar was actually being nice. He departed after a brief exchange of words.\n\nBut they still felt uneasy. They followed Han Sen, not wanting to let him escape their watch.\n\n\u201cGiving up was a good idea. After all, they are the Extreme King.\u201d Li Keer let out an exaggerated sigh.\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cLady Keer, do you like chess?\u201d\n\n\u201cChess?\u201d Li Keer was shocked.\n\n\u201cYes, chess.\u201d Han Sen nodded. \u201cDo you play?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to play chess, but why are you asking?\u201d Li Keer didn\u2019t know what Han Sen wanted.\n\n\u201cPlease play a game of chess with me.\u201d Han Sen pointed to a planet that was far away. \u201cHow about there?\u201d\n\nLi Keer knew Han Sen was up to something, but instead of asking what he was planning, she just nodded.\n\nThe two of them arrived on the planet. They found a quiet place and set up the chess game. When the two royal knights who were stalking him saw Dollar playing chess with a female Sky, they were surprised.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d A royal knight mumbled in confusion.\n\nThe other royal knight laughed and said, \u201cSo, what? No matter how strong he is, he is just a King. Plus, he is a King from a nameless race. He wouldn\u2019t dare make enemies of the Extreme King. He made the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so. That way, we won\u2019t have to die.\u201d The royal knights were finally beginning to relax. They had seen Han Sen fight the Gold Armor General, and so they didn\u2019t want to fight him.\n\nLi Keer, who was playing chess with Han Sen, thought that they had dramatically misjudged Han Sen\u2019s intentions. That was because she wasn\u2019t actually playing chess with Han Sen; she was playing with a doppelganger. The real Han Sen had left a long time ago. Even Li Keer hadn\u2019t felt it when he teleported away.\n\n\u201cThis guy really is brave. He dares to steal from the Extreme King. Not only that, but he\u2019s taking something that they want really badly.\u201d Although Li Keer was playing chess, she wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the game. Her eyes were flashing, and a starscape gleamed across them. It was the image of Bai Wan Jie fighting the Sea Sky Eye."
