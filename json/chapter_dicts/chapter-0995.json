Then, he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this will be my final fight in the third spirit base. No one will dare fight me, after what they are about to see. That being said, I\u2019ll grant you the opportunity to forfeit before we begin.\u201d\n\nThe spirits that watched, all believed Han Sen was trying to bluff his way out of the fight.\n\nAt first, Split-Space King did not say a word. He silently stepped onto the clouds of Shen Xiao, then said coldly, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid, huh? You should be.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed in response, and said, \u201cYou can go on believing that, if it helps. But how about you just cut the crap and try to kill me, like you\u2019ve been saying over and over.\u201d\n\nSplit-Space King swung his hand like a blade that seemed to tear through the fabric of reality.\n\nCracks spiderwebbed through the very space around Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHe really does wield the space element. Although it doesn\u2019t actually shatter the dimension, it is quite impressive to see cracks form in the fabric of space itself.\u201d Han Sen wanted the genes even more now.\n\nBut seeing what was occurring around him, Han Sen did not try to fall back. He wanted to see if his super king spirit could withstand the attack.\n\nIf he could not go up against space, then that meant he was not indestructible.\n\nSo, Han Sen stretched his body as light coursed through his veins and muscles. The light of his exterior was amplified.\n\nAs the cracks of the dimension drew nearer, it looked as if they would shred his body.\n\nBut without fear, Han Sen stretched his arms and prepared to punch his foe, seemingly without a care for the cracks that were fast approaching.\n\n\u201cFool!\u201d Split-Space King laughed.\n\nAlthough his power was low, the cracks were like flying weaponry that sought to slice and dice Han Sen into bits.\n\nAll the spirits, seeing Han Sen just move forward, thought something was amiss.\n\nThe moment Han Sen went through the cracks, his body bled.\n\nEven Han Sen\u2019s fist was bleeding. And as he pushed on through, he did so in a red light, as his clothes were dyed with his blood.\n\nEven king spirits could not move through the cracks without getting destroyed in a barrage of lacerations.\n\n\u201cSpace powers are too strong. Is there anything out there that can withstand it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSplit-Space King really is indestructible.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven The King can\u2019t beat him. If anything could actually challenge him, I\u2019d wager it is only a spirit that wields the element of time.\u201d\n\nSplit-Space King looked on cockily, saying, \u201cWhat a fool; trying to transcend and break through the fracturing of space.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was covered in gruesome gashes, and the red-shredding of his being was like the marking of a spiderweb. Split-Space King believed The King\u2019s body would collapse into a mound of chopped meat if he pushed through a second more.\n\nBut Han Sen\u2019s fist was getting close. It was getting dangerously close.\n\nSplit-Space King\u2019s face changed. He wanted to formulate more space tears, but it was too late for him to do anything.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s raging fist was going to land, and the best he could do was establish a flimsy block.\n\nMuscle collided with muscle, as bone went up against bone.\n\nThe spirits, seeing Han Sen\u2019s body approach with a glowing fist, watched with rapt intensity as it broke Split-Space King\u2019s arms and drove itself directly into his smug face.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe white light drew together to create an orb of incinerating power\u2014one that destroyed Split-Space King\u2019s head. The arrogant spirit was sent flying back, crashing into statue in a bloody heap of broken bones and blood.\n\n\u201cSpace King Spirit Gene +1.\u201d\n\nShen Xiao was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. No one could believe what their eyes had just witnessed.\n\nThey could not believe Split-Space King had lost to a single punch delivered by The King.\n\nThe eyes of the audience stared unblinking in disbelief of the sight. In continued silence, their eyes flickered between Han Sen standing still, and the crumpled body of Split-Space King and the bloodied statue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Split-Space King respawned and did not wait a moment before racing forward to attack Han Sen again.\n\nSplit-Space King created a multitude of cracks across the arena. It was as if Han Sen was standing in a world of glass, one that was slowly breaking and collapsing.\n\n\u201cIf you could actually break space, only then might I fear you. A kitten could scratch me harder than all this could.\u201d Han Sen threw his fist forward once more.\n\nAgain, many of the dimensional breakings cut Han Sen, but the damage done was only skin-deep.\n\nNo damage was done to his muscles or even his super body.\n\nSplit-Space King was incredibly angry, and that fury spread out into his surroundings, making the area around him look like a broken snowglobe.\n\nBut still, even those attacks would only draw blood. Not a single one of those cracks were enough to truly repel Han Sen and his thirsty fist.\n\nBoom!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s punch nestled itself deep into Split-Space King\u2019s head once again, with no fear, hesitation, or pain softening the merciless strike.\n\nSplit-Space King was powerful, but his body was not built to withstand the likes of Han Sen.\n\nDuring his respawn phase, Han Sen approached the statue. And when Split-Space King respawned, there were no dramatics to precede the next killing. Upon each respawn, Han Sen was there, waiting for his next kill. The statue was like a space geno point dispensing machine, and the only sound to be heard was that of a brief scream being cut short every time.\n\nIndeed, no spirit dared make a sound as they watched Split-Space King be utterly annihilated each and every time.\n\nIt was a frightening scene, watching an incredibly powerful king be utterly destroyed like an ant.\n\n\u201cIndestructible.\u201d Every spirit had this word rattling around in their heads."
