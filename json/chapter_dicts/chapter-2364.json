He sounded as if he was about to eat someone.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen unleashed his Shocking Sky Punch, and the half-deified guard\u2019s bones were pulverized. There wasn\u2019t a single inch of bone that remained intact. His body slumped to the ground like a sack of mud.\n\nHan Sen grabbed the half-deified guard and lifted him back up. The man\u2019s body was trashed, but he wasn\u2019t dead. Han Sen threw him at Prince Swordstar.\n\n\u201cAs per your request, he is alive,\u201d Han Sen said flatly.\n\n\u201cBai Yi, I will kill you.\u201d Prince Swordstar caught the guard, whose entire body had been devastated. Han Sen had even shattered the guard\u2019s xenogeneic gene. Prince Swordstar was furious.\n\n\u201cI have gone to so much trouble to be nice to you. You asked me to keep him alive. I refrained from killing him, and you still aren\u2019t happy. It\u2019s hard work being a big brother.\u201d Han Sen said, then he jumped.\n\nThe other three guards were overwhelmed with a mixture of anger and fear. They wanted to run away, but the Shocking Sky Punch was already coming down on them like the angry waves of a turbulent sea.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t escape that wrath, but if they tried to repel it, that raging power would still crush their bodies. The punching powers came for each of them in turn. The two ninth-tier Kings went down first, then the last half-deified guard fell as well. Han Sen trashed their bodies in a few quick punches, then tossed their crippled bodies back toward Prince Swordstar.\n\nThe nearby royal children were shocked. Han Sen\u2019s cruel and overbearing skills made them think twice about how they might treat him in the future.\n\nPrince Swordstar gritted his teeth until his jaws ached, and he had to resist the urge to attack Han Sen himself. He glared at Han Sen, then carried the four disabled guards away.\n\n\u201cCome on! That Prince Swordstar is such a wimp. He\u2019s just accepting that loss?\u201d Prince Nineteen lifted his lips in a sneer.\n\n\u201cThat is why he is scary. That Prince Swordstar isn\u2019t one to be ruled by simple emotions.\u201d Bai Canglang approached. He sighed and said, \u201cOur generation of the Extreme King is both the most promising and the most hopeless generation there has ever been. There are too many wonderful royal children, and now there are people like Sixteen, Seventeen, and even Swordstar. When the time comes for someone to claim leadership, it won\u2019t happen peacefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cChaos is fun. Otherwise, life is like a pool of stagnant water. That is boring,\u201d Prince Nineteen said.\n\nEveryone watched as Han Sen climbed onto the primary root king dragon. No one dared to provoke him; he had just suppressed half-deified guards, after all. The royal children knew they couldn\u2019t compete against Han Sen. Even the ones that could fight him knew that they didn\u2019t want to do so in King\u2019s Garden.\n\nHan Sen took the blood kirin up to sit atop the king dragon\u2019s head with him. The other royal children drifted away.\n\nAfter a few hours of daylight, the yellow leaves began to glow. The primary root king dragon roared and dropped underground.\n\nUnlike the small king dragon Han Sen had used before, this primary root king dragon was big, and it went far underground. It went so close to that golden spot.\n\nWhen Han Sen had trained with Bai Wei, the source of power had looked like a distant golden sun. Now, because he was so much closer, it was too big to describe.\n\nWaves of gold king air began to emerge and flow over Han Sen and the blood kirin. Any king air he absorbed would help Han Sen refine the powers in his body.\n\nThe blood kirin was sucking in the king air greedily, and he looked healthier with every breath.\n\nAfter Han Sen absorbed thirty waves of king air, he heard an announcement play in his head.\n\nDuke Gene +1.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, but he was also very happy. He said, \u201cAre these waves of king air actually xenogeneic genes?\u201d\n\nWhen he came last time, he had been very far from the tree. The king air he absorbed had been too weak to generate a Duke gene. Now he had a lot of king air, so he could exploit its full strength.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been terribly interested in the king air before, but now he was motivated. He absorbed the king air as fast as he could. He absorbed fifty waves of king air and heard the Duke gene notification once more.\n\n\u201cIf this is the case, I don\u2019t need to find any more xenogeneics. Simply absorbing this king air will give me enough Duke genes!\u201d Han Sen thought happily. He had claimed this primary root king dragon, and so he was going to absorb the king air like mad.\n\nWhile the primary root king dragon was still underground, Han Sen\u2019s Duke gene tally reached the prestigious one hundred. He absorbed many waves of king air, but his Duke genes didn\u2019t increase beyond that.\n\nHan Sen used the hundred Duke genes to open the first gene lock of The Story of Genes.\n\nIt was a smooth process that went exactly as it had for Jadeskin. After The Story of Genes had its first gene lock open, he obtained an astral body in the geno universe.\n\nOne hundred Duke genes were gone from his total, and so Han Sen stayed put to collect more of that king air. His Duke gene tally started to rack up again.\n\n\u201cThis is some good stuff.\u201d Han Sen grinned. He had claimed this primary root king dragon, so he wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere. He planned to use the king air to unlock the gene locks of a few different geno arts.\n\nSomewhere far away in King\u2019s Kingdom, there was a mountain that hung in the darkness. The mountain looked gigantic, but no matter how long you spent flying toward its peak, you could never reach the mountain.\n\nIt was known as Extreme Mountain, one of the three famous mountains of King\u2019s Kingdom. Countless terrifying legends swirled around its existence, and many elites had been killed while exploring its reaches. Many half-deified and deified elites were said to roam there.\n\nThe secrets of Extreme Mountain had yet to be discovered, as there were many places on the mountain\u2019s slopes that not even King Bai himself would dare explore.\n\nOn the left side of Extreme Mountain, a ghost-like man walked along a path.\n\nEvery step he took was like some invincible power was coming down on him, making his body look lighter. By the time he was halfway up the slope, his body appeared half-transparent. He looked as if he was going to fade away at any second.\n\nBut that man still stared up at the peak of Extreme Mountain, and he kept walking forward in a bid to reach it.\n\n\u201cHalf mountain, half sky, half extreme. One step, one life, one world.\u201d When he was halfway up the mountain, he saw that sentence scrawled into a cliff face. It was written in blood.\n\nThe man saw it, but he kept on going up the mountain. He didn\u2019t pay any further attention to the writing.\n\nThe legends state that those words were left behind by the Extreme King\u2019s seventh king. The seventh king went there as a half-deified, and he stopped there to write that down before leaving.\n\nAfter that, all the heirs of the Extreme King that ventured to the Extreme Mountain and went past those words were known to have died. There had only been one exception to that rule.\n\nThe exception was the previous ruler of the Extreme King, King Bao. King Bao went past the writing, but he didn\u2019t die. And he never talked about his experiences on Extreme Mountain. All he said was that if there was any person fortunate enough to reach the top of Extreme Mountain, they would become the best of their generation and achieve an invincible body."
