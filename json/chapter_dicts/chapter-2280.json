    "text": "\u201cIf you weren\u2019t there, what would be the point of me staying in that palace of yours?\u201d Han Sen asked distractedly as he turned the needle over in his hands.\n\n\u201cThat is my business, just do as you\u2019re told,\u201d Yisha said.\n\nHan Sen smiled at Yisha. \u201cI must apologize, my Queen. I am a guy who would rather have his freedom and be able to relax as he chooses. I\u2019m not a fan of staying put and looking after something. You should really go and take care of your own palace.\u201d\n\nYisha returned his smile with a wry one of her own. \u201cIf I could return, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you right now, would I?\u201d\n\nShe started to say something more, but suddenly, Han Sen froze. He was staring at the ghost statue, and with a flick of his wrist, he tossed the needle toward it.\n\nYisha sighed. She had spent some time researching that bone needle. It was almost completely indestructible, but it had no power. She had been unable to feel any power residing at its tip. If she had been able to use the bone needle and any power it possessed to break the ghost statue, she wouldn\u2019t have been bound there when Han Sen found her.\n\nBut Yisha stared with a slack jaw as the bone needle sailed toward the statue, completely unimpeded. The ghost statue had knocked Han Sen to the ground countless times, but it didn\u2019t react to the bone needle at all. It merely watched the bone needle strike its forehead.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 How is this possible\u2026?\u201d Yisha\u2019s eyes were wide. She gazed at the strange scene with disbelief.\n\nWhen the bone needle pierced the ghost statue\u2019s forehead, the needle lit up red. It shone brighter and brighter, and before long, the ghost statue started to shake. The noise of breaking rocks began to rumble around them.\n\nPang!\n\nThe next moment, the statue fell to pieces. The grip holding Yisha and the blood kirin was suddenly released. They fell to the bridge, the shattered remains of the statue\u2019s hands falling around them.\n\nThe blood kirin was injured, but it hadn\u2019t lost much strength. It gathered itself back up, and its signature red cloud swirled around it.\n\nYisha was close to death, and the blood in her body had almost run dry. She was very weak, and she didn\u2019t have the strength to react. She fell to the ground limply.\n\nHan Sen caught her in his arms to prevent her from hitting the bridge. He smiled and said, \u201cMy Queen, it looks like you are going to have to tend to your palace after all.\u201d\n\nThe purple air across the entire jade bridge began to spread and thin. Giant rocks began to fall. Yisha was held in Han Sen\u2019s arms. As she looked up at Han Sen from below, her heart started to feel strange.\n\nShe had never seen a man from a lower angle. She was always the one up high. She had never felt like this before, and suddenly, she started to feel even weaker.\n\nAs the last pieces of the ghost statue fell, the purple air across the bridge began to evaporate. Han Sen, the blood kirin, and Yisha started to return to normal. The jade bridge that had seemed endless now looked as it previously had. They could see the other twelve jade bridges around them and the thirteen teleporters in front of them.\n\nFox Queen and the others, however, were gone. They must have traveled through the teleporter and left that palace.\n\nBecause the blood kirin was injured, Han Sen opted not to ride it. He was still holding Yisha as he strode across the jade bridge.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go through the teleporter?\u201d Yisha asked weakly from where she was cradled against Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cOf course I will, but before that, I want to walk across the rest of the jade bridges,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen wanted to walk the thirteen bridges for one simple reason: he wanted to get each statue\u2019s power.\n\nAfter Yisha gave him the bone needle, he realized that the bone needle was a xenogeneic treasure that combined with Blood-Pulse Plunder. If he used Blood-Pulse Plunder by itself, he would need to beat the enemy first. He couldn\u2019t use Blood-Pulse Plunder to take away an opponent\u2019s blood pulse until the enemy didn\u2019t have enough power to fight back.\n\nIf Han Sen was squaring off against an extra-strong enemy, though, there was always the chance that he might not be able to beat them. During times like that, Blood-Pulse Plunder wouldn\u2019t be very useful.\n\nBut with this bone needle, things were different. Han Sen could imbue the bone needle with the powers of Blood-Pulse Plunder. After that, he only had to put the bone needle into an enemy\u2019s body, and the bone needle would plunder the enemy\u2019s blood pulse. Han Sen only needed to stick the needle into a foe.\n\nThat being said, the bone needle wasn\u2019t powerful on its own. Han Sen would have to use his own strength. But piercing a needle into an enemy was still far easier than trying to beat an opponent that had him bested.\n\nThe statues on the thirteen bridges were each prepared for the combination of Blood-Pulse Plunder and the bone needle. The bone needle could easily pierce the statues and take the hidden blood pulse power that resided within them. Han Sen would basically have to repeat what he did to the ghost statue. The bone needle had a concentration of power now, too.\n\nIt was just a drop, but it was a blood pulse hell power. It was a deified power.\n\nThere had to be something similar on the other twelve bridges. That was something Han Sen was most assuredly not going to miss out on.\n\nHan Sen switched positions and carried Yisha on his back. He walked to another jade bridge, and just as he had expected, the first half was safe. When he approached a statue in the middle of the bridge, he used the bone needle to absorb the blood pulse power inside the statue. The statue then fell, and the bridge lost its protection. It became an ordinary jade bridge again.\n\nHan Sen walked through the rest of the bridges and took the blood pulse power from the statues. Yisha\u2019s surprise was written plainly across her face, making it obvious that she had no clue why the bone needle was so powerful in Han Sen\u2019s hands.\n\nYisha had picked up the bone needle, but she had no idea that the needle had to be used in conjunction with Blood-Pulse Plunder. She didn\u2019t have Blood-Pulse Plunder, so aside from its sturdiness, the needle had no utility in her hands.\n\nThe second Sacred Leader statue had been destroyed for some reason, so Han Sen hadn\u2019t been able to retrieve the bone needle personally. Yet it landed in his hands anyway when Yisha volunteered it.\n\nThe Sacred Leader had blocked all the routes, but something had been left on each path for those that traversed it. The items were connected with each other in ways that Han Sen hadn\u2019t yet figured out. The Sacred Leader\u2019s full plans were still a mystery.\n\nThe Silver Sycees, Blood-Pulse Plunder, the bone needle, thirteen blood pulse powers\u2014they were all very rare and valuable treasures. At this point, he could easily start a fight with a deified being.\n\nThe treasures were meant to be obtained through tests given by the Sacred Leader. No one had realized how scary the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasures could be.\n\n\u201cMy Queen, are you afraid of needles?\u201d Han Sen asked Yisha.\n\nYisha was shocked, and she did not know what he meant.\n\n\u201cI mean, are you afraid of being pricked with a needle?\u201d Han Sen blinked and asked.\n\n\u201cAre you going to give me a shot?\u201d Yisha looked at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen lifted his bone needle while he smiled at Yisha. \u201cClose your eyes if you are afraid. The pain will be over in a second.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen thrust his bone needle into Yisha\u2019s chest. A drop of hell blood came out, and it blended into Yisha\u2019s own blood.\n\nIf he wanted to survive, he had to get rid of Fox Queen. And unless another deified elite challenged her, it was unlikely Fox Queen could be defeated.\n\nEven with Han Sen\u2019s deified blood pulse, his actual power wouldn\u2019t be deified. Yisha, however, was different. She was half a step away from being deified herself. Getting the hell blood pulse would give her a boost towards the lofty goal of becoming deified. This was their best chance of taking the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure."
