She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI want to know why, too. I want to know why I am so talented, and yet, not a single Siren was able to appreciate my accomplishments. Is it because I don\u2019t have the blood of the holy virgin? Is that why that b*tch became the holy virgin instead? If a traitor like that was able to become the holy virgin, why couldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI waited many years for that b*tch to die, but they let you\u2014a girl who didn\u2019t even have pure blood\u2014become the holy virgin instead. I want to know why they never considered giving me the chance. I\u2019m so smart. No one amongst the Siren could do the things that I\u2019ve done. But just because I don\u2019t have a drop of the holy virgin\u2019s blood, I have to be considered a mere commoner? In this world, there\u2019s no point in asking \u2018why.\u2019 Things only belong to you if you fight for them.\u201d The old Siren woman gave a twisted laugh.\n\n\u201cNow, I finally have this chance. If the Sirens aren\u2019t willing to accept me, then I will destroy this entire race. I will offer my blood to the Siren Bottle and conjure a new race, one which will worship me as their alpha.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of that, you are willing to kill off the last of our kind?\u201d Lan Haixin looked very sad.\n\n\u201cThey are nothing. As long as I have the Siren Bottle, I can be deified. I can create a race of my own.\u201d The old Siren woman sounded a little crazy.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the holy virgin blood. You cannot control the Siren Bottle. All you have done is for nothing.\u201d Lan Haixin looked unspeakably sad.\n\nThe old Siren woman laughed. \u201cYou will just have to thank that b*tch, then. She wanted her hybrid son to claim the holy bottle. She built this Crystal Palace and the blood altar here and made a deal with you. She did all of this for his benefit. She only used you for your blood. With this altar, the Siren blood, and the refinement of the holy bottle, I can control it. Even without the holy virgin\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suffered much humiliation when I was young, but I sided with that b*tch. I did everything I could to earn her trust. I almost died multiple times during my service to her. Even my son died for her. I sacrificed so much to gain her faith. Now, I\u2019m the only one who can wield this technique. That b*tch would\u2019ve never imagined I was scheming to betray her. She never knew I was the one that killed her. She couldn\u2019t even tell her secret to her hybrid son. Now, everything belongs to me. I will be the next race\u2019s alpha.\u201d After saying this, the old Siren woman laughed like mad. She seemed utterly self-assured.\n\n\u201cYou seem to have forgotten I\u2019m still here.\u201d Han Sen looked at that old Siren woman with pride.\n\nThe old Siren woman\u2019s smile vanished as she looked at Han Sen. \u201cYou aren\u2019t bad. You must be as devious as that b*tch to have hidden things for so long. Your own plan was decent, but you are still too young, and you ended up killing all the Siren. What a shame. Now, the blood altar\u2019s process has begun, and the holy bottle is in the midst of being refined. Although it cannot be fully used yet, I only need to borrow a little of its power to kill both you and the blood kirin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that you are completely without holy virgin blood. How can you use the holly bottle\u2019s power without it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen had guessed the old Siren woman\u2019s plan a while ago, but he hadn\u2019t killed her yet because he wanted the Siren Bottle, as well.\n\nHe had the same problem as the old Siren woman. He had the Original Water King Body, but he didn\u2019t have the holy virgin blood. The holy bottle wouldn\u2019t accept him as its master.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t just because Han Sen had replaced Bai Yi, either. Even Bai Yi\u2019s mother didn\u2019t believe the young prince would be able to make use of the bottle. So, she set up the blood altar. She needed a blood sacrifice so that Bai Yi could control the Siren Bottle, but that should still be impossible for Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen wanted to know the old Siren woman\u2019s plan. She must have some method for controlling the Siren Bottle. So, he didn\u2019t yet strike her down.\n\n\u201cIt is okay. Soon, you will believe. I\u2019m going to use both of you hybrids as a sacrifice. Then, I will be able to control the Siren Bottle and create a race of my own. I will be the alpha and leader of it!\u201d the old Siren woman said. She walked towards the altar and picked up the Siren Bottle. Obsession was etched deep into the lines of her face.\n\nLan Haixin used her area power in a bid to stop the old woman, but as soon as Lan Haixin moved onto the altar, the altar\u2019s rainbow light bounced her back. She was unable to access that zone.\n\nThe old Siren woman lifted the bottle and laughed. \u201cThat cheap b*tch wasn\u2019t at my level, but she was still better than the two of you. You two hybrids will die today.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the old Siren woman with interest and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me? Aren\u2019t you afraid that the Extreme King will hunt you down?\u201d\n\nThe old Siren woman grinned and looked at him with disdain. \u201cI watched Bai Yi grow up. Aside from that b*tch, no one else understood him more than I. You are not Bai Yi. I don\u2019t know how you did what you did\u2026 Perhaps it was a similar skill to Consume? But regardless, your ability to open the Crystal Palace door proves that you refined the hybrid Bai Yi\u2019s blood. I get your blood and give you to King Bai. He will appreciate that, I think. I can get the Siren Bottle and receive King Bai\u2019s reward. I must say, God seems to be on my side\u2026 Haha!\u201d\n\nLan Haixin looked at Han Sen with proper shock. She had never realized the Bai Yi in front of her was a fake.\n\nBut she never thought someone would be brave enough to disguise themselves as a prince of the Extreme King, either.\n\nInstead of denying the accusation, Han Sen admitted it. He stood silently and watched the old Siren woman. Her hands were glowing. Power was coming out of her hands and flowing into the Siren Bottle.\n\nThe Siren Bottle\u2019s wings were like the faces of Siren women. They looked alive. Their eyes shone with light, and blue waves rippled across them. They made sad sniffling noises like an instrument was playing.\n\nNot long after, a waterdrop arose inside the bottle.\n\nThe old Siren woman happily grabbed the drop and put it into her mouth. Her body began to glow and change.\n\nRainbow-color light rinsed over her, and the old Siren woman\u2019s tree bark-like face changed. Her age and wrinkles disappeared, and she became an eighteen-year-old girl with skin that was smooth and white.\n\nHer fish scales looked transparent and crystal, and they glowed with rainbow light. Her entire body had been completely renewed, and her presence changed along with it."
