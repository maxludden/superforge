    "text": "Han Sen kept firing his two pistols without reprieve, countering each of Shale\u2019s punching powers. No matter how strong Shale\u2019s punches were, none of them could come close to touching Han Sen.\n\nIt had taken Li Chun Qiu mere moments to confirm that when Shale used Star Explode, his power only equaled Han Sen. His expression looked strained, and he thought to himself, \u201cIf this is Han Sen\u2019s base power, then that is too scary.\u201d\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite were even more stunned, because they knew for sure that they were only seeing Han Sen\u2019s base power. He wasn\u2019t using a power-enhancing geno art like Shale was.\n\nHis base power was enough to fight back Shale\u2019s Star Explode. That was almost unbelievable.\n\nIn truth, Han Sen thought this was an expected result. After all, his four top geno arts had all reached a deified level. Each geno art had the power of a deified, and he had four of them reinforcing the same body. Their additions to his power weren\u2019t merely additive.\n\nAs time went by, Shale was getting stronger and stronger. His body shone with ever-increasing starlight, but his punches were still being negated by Han Sen\u2019s bullets. The ten minutes were flying by, and Shale\u2019s skin was starting to crack and bleed. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to last long.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, take my punch again!\u201d Shale roared. He punched toward Han Sen like a raging madman.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen saw the valley before him fill up with an uncountable number of suns. The punching power was like an entire constellation exploding.\n\n\u201cReturn to Origin under Star Explode. Even a larva deified elite would have reason to fear that blow,\u201d Li Chun Qiu thought to himself.\n\nShale\u2019s performance was greater than he realized. Beneath Star Explode, he could still perfectly activate a punch using Return to Origin. Shale\u2019s power and talent were truly excellent.\n\nHan Sen saw the punching power washing toward him like a flooded river. He didn\u2019t plan on falling back, though. He combined his two pistols to form another weapon. It was a rocket launcher.\n\nHan Sen lifted the launcher in his arms. He took aim and fired a rocket at the star river-like punching power. A beam of light was emitted from the launcher, and it went soaring into the center of Shale\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cNo matter how strong that rocket is, it cannot go against Return to Origin while it is fueled by Star Explode,\u201d Li Chun Qiu thought to himself. The next second, he froze.\n\nThe rocket slammed into the center of that stream of punches that was like a river of stars, and then it detonated like a nuclear bomb. The explosion consumed every bit of Shale\u2019s punching power.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe following eruption looked as if it could melt the entire universe. Inside that beautiful example of Star Explode, there was too much light for the observers to look. They couldn\u2019t see anything.\n\nWhen the lights of the explosion receded, Li Chun Qiu saw Han Sen and Shale still in one piece within the valley. But an enormous crater had been torn into the stone of the valley between them.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t attack, and Shale didn\u2019t attack, either. But everyone knew Shale had already lost. His Star Explode time was up. He didn\u2019t have the power to fight Han Sen anymore.\n\n\u201cI lose,\u201d Shale admitted honestly. But Han Sen could tell that the man still wanted to fight. He wasn\u2019t going to quit because of a one-time failure.\n\nLi Chun Qiu didn\u2019t say anything. Han Sen really had won. Anyone could tell Han Sen had far more power than Shale. It wasn\u2019t a victory that Han Sen had pulled off by the skin of his teeth.\n\nBut Li Chun Qiu was confident that if he had more time to raise Shale to the peak of his power, he would have a chance to beat Han Sen.\n\nBut the Very High man had to admit that Han Sen was strong right now. In fact, the Crystallizer was stronger than he had imagined. He thought Han Sen was below Shale and Yu Shanxin, but now, Han Sen\u2019s battle power was clearly no weaker than theirs. He was possibly stronger.\n\n\u201cCombat power doesn\u2019t mean anything. The most important thing is the ability to become a true god. Shale is a fake eleven armor talent. There is a high chance he can become a true god. That will be the real victory.\u201d Li Chun Qiu stared at Han Sen, then left the area with Shale.\n\n\u201cYou became deified without informing us. How do you plan on paying us back for this?\u201d Li Keer smiled at Han Sen as she spoke.\n\n\u201cI will do whatever you want me to,\u201d Han Sen said while spreading his hands.\n\n\u201cI want you to stand facing a wall,\u201d Li Keer said, acting angry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a grown-up, not a three-year-old. Punish me another way,\u201d Han Sen said with a wry smile. Only kids would be punished by having to face a wall.\n\n\u201cNo, you have to face the wall. And you have to face the wall for a whole month,\u201d Li Keer said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen frowned in annoyance. He wanted to say something, but Exquisite interrupted, \u201cStop arguing. Little Sister said you should face a wall because after a silkworm becomes deified, they have to go to the ancient wall. That will be good for all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d Han Sen just realized Li Keer wasn\u2019t really being petulant; she was just teasing him.\n\n\u201cBut you have just become deified. You can go there in a few days. You should visit Bao\u2019er and spend some time with her first. You won\u2019t see her for a whole month while you\u2019re at the ancient wall,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\nHan Sen nodded, and then Exquisite took him back to the Star Tree.\n\nBecause of what happened before, Li Keer and Exquisite no longer dared to leave Han Sen\u2019s side. One of them always remained by Han Sen\u2019s side in case something big happened. That made him super depressed. He didn\u2019t have any free time anymore.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t look like I\u2019m too special. Otherwise, I won\u2019t have any freedom at all,\u201d Han Sen thought as he sat under the tree and drank a cup of tea.\n\nExquisite could see what he was thinking, but she ignored him and continued reading a book.\n\n\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d Han Sen asked, poking his head around next to her.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Exquisite snapped the book closed before Han Sen could see what it was. She placed it in her pocket and cleared her throat self-consciously.\n\n\u201cWhat is this Ancient Wall placed that I\u2019m going to?\u201d Although Han Sen was curious about what Exquisite was reading, if she wasn\u2019t going to tell him, then he wasn\u2019t going to keep asking.\n\nExquisite quietly said, \u201cAncient Wall is a place where one of my ancestors used to draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cDraw?\u201d Han Sen was surprised.\n\nSeeing Han Sen\u2019s surprise, Exquisite smiled and explained, \u201cIt isn\u2019t an ordinary drawing. He was a famous genius of our race. Although he never became a leader, he studied the Very High Sense to a degree that no one else\u2014aside from our alpha\u2014has ever been able to match.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Exquisite looked up at the Star Fruit above them and said, \u201cBefore he entered the Geno Hall, that elder sat before the Ancient Wall for two years. Two years later, when he opened his eyes, the first thing he did was draw a picture on the wall. After he drew it, he flew away and went to the Geno Hall. The drawing has been there ever since. It is a legend, and not even now can people understand what that drawing is about.\u201d"
