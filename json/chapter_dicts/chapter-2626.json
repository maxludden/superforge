    "text": "It took an unusual person to be able to see the twelve towers and five cities. That was especially true of the five cities. Only the people that could see them were allowed to enter.\n\nHan Sen followed Lone Bamboo into White King City. It was different from Black King City. White King City was a giant, circular construct that sort of resembled an amphitheater in Rome.\n\nAfter the two entered, Han Sen realized that it really was a large arena. Banks of seats surrounded the circular fighting pit. Currently, there wasn\u2019t a soul other than the two of them in the entire arena. There wasn\u2019t even a single creature.\n\n\u201cI thought there were xenogeneics here. Why is there nobody here?\u201d Han Sen asked, glancing around the empty stadium. He couldn\u2019t detect the presence of anything living.\n\n\u201cThe creatures that were here most recently have all been killed, and new ones have not appeared yet. Wait a little bit. They will be here soon,\u201d Lone Bamboo said. He moved to sit down on a flight of stairs.\n\nHan Sen followed him and sat down. They waited together for something to happen.\n\nNot much later, Han Sen heard the sound of chains being rattled. He looked toward the arena. The gate leading into the arena began to rise, clanking its way into the air.\n\nWhen the gate opened, passage to and from White King City was closed off.\n\n\u201cAre we not allowed to leave?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cWhite King City hosts deathmatches. Only when one team is destroyed will the match end. If you want to leave here, you will have no choice but to kill the xenogeneics that oppose you,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know what creature will be coming to face us. What if it is deified?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I brought you with me,\u201d Lone Bamboo said with a hearty chuckle.\n\n\u201cOh, d*mn! You tricked me.\u201d Han Sen looked at the arena\u2019s gate, hoping that whatever creature emerged wouldn\u2019t be deified.\n\nThe gate rose, revealing the entrance to a dark tunnel. He couldn\u2019t see into that darkness, but he could hear the approaching footsteps.\n\nShortly after, something came into view.\n\nIt was a creature clad in silver armor. Its hands clutched a thin, silver sword. From the eye-slit in the creature\u2019s helmet, a sinister red light glowed.\n\n\u201cIt looks like our luck is not too shabby,\u201d Lone Bamboo laughed.\n\n\u201cYou call this \u2018not too shabby\u2019?\u201d Han Sen could see the monster clearly. A silver substance chain glinted faintly around the armored creature. It was a deified xenogeneic.\n\n\u201cPrimitive deified xenogeneic Silver Destroyer. Based on the reading of the God Spirit Touch, this xenogeneic has eight armor talents. If we can collect its xenogeneic egg, perhaps we can raise it to larva class,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s smile looked a little strained. \u201cAren\u2019t we gambling with our lives here? What if this xenogeneic is already at the transmutation or larva class already? We\u2019d be dead for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sky claimed the White Jade Jing a very long time ago,\u201d Lone Bamboo said calmly. \u201cWe have conducted a great deal of research on White King City. Sky Chance\u2019s department has calculated that around eighty percent of the xenogeneics here are King class. Ten percent of them are half-deified. Less than ten percent is deified. Plus, it is an even lower chance that you encounter a deified of a higher class. That is why I said we were so lucky. There was a very low chance of going up against a foe such as this. This is precisely what I wanted.\u201d As Lone Bamboo spoke, the Silver Destroyer reached the center of the arena. From there, it looked in their direction.\n\nBefore Han Sen could react, the Silver Destroyer raised the short sword in its hands. It thrust the blade toward Han Sen, and its silver substance chains shot from the sword like needles.\n\n\u201cThere are two people here. Why is it going after me first? Am I that unlucky?\u201d That thought remained firmly in Han Sen\u2019s mind, but it did him little good. He had to act.\n\nPang!\n\nThe silver sword light hit Han Sen, and his body exploded. At the same moment, another Han Sen appeared in a different portion of the arena. He was holding his Six Core Snake Bow. He drew the bow, nocking a jade light to the string. He let go, firing the arrow toward the Silver Destroyer.\n\nLone Bamboo then joined Han Sen in the arena. His jade sword glowed with a sword light as he slashed at the Silver Destroyer.\n\nThe Silver Destroyer swung its silver sword twice. Han Sen\u2019s arrow and Lone Bamboo\u2019s sword lights were suddenly shattered. They hadn\u2019t even gotten close to their enemy.\n\nThe Silver Destroyer\u2019s substance chains didn\u2019t seem to have a wide area of control, so Han Sen and Lone Bamboo kept moving as they fought. They sprinted around White King City to avoid the attacks that came after them, continually searching for a way to counterattack.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell? His sword\u2019s moving a lot faster now,\u201d Han Sen thought. He wasn\u2019t able to dodge the next strike. A silver sword light flashed right by his face, drawing a line of blood across his cheek. He felt it as the blow grated against his cheekbone.\n\n\u201cIts substance chains seem to rely on speed to maintain their power,\u201d Lone Bamboo said, as he unleashed another sword light. But the Silver Destroyer swung its sword and broke that one too.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Han Sen used his other hand to draw Ghost Teeth Knife. He summoned a knife light and weaved a web of silks across the sky. He prepared to draw them down upon the Silver Destroyer.\n\nBut Silver Destroyer continued to swing its small silver sword wildly, destroying any semblance of a knife silk net before it could even form. That surprised Han Sen a great deal.\n\n\u201cSo fast!\u201d Even with his excellent vision, he couldn\u2019t see how the Silver Destroyer was dispatching his silk web so fast.\n\nLone Bamboo shouted. The third eye upon his forehead opened. His pupils turned a purple-red, splitting into shapes that looked like cherry blossoms.Han Sen remembered that Lone Bamboo\u2019s Sky Eye should have been plain red. When Han Sen had seen the man\u2019s third eye before, it carried an intimidatingly murderous aura. That third eye was a thing of the past, though. Lone Bamboo had changed.\n\nAnd now Han Sen understood. Lone Bamboo\u2019s third eye had changed because he became one with the body of the Purple-Eye Butterfly.\n\nFour butterfly wings spread majestically from Lone Bamboo\u2019s back. His Sky Eye released a purple and red beam that looked like a substance chain.\n\nHan Sen was familiar with that beam. It should have been a purple eye godlight that could restrain others, but when Han Sen brushed against that beam with his senses, it felt more dangerous and violent. It was different from the Evil Eye Han Sen had seen before.\n\nThe purple and red beam landed upon the Silver Destroyer. The Silver Destroyer swung its sword in a vain bid to break the godlight, but the godlight wasn\u2019t solid. The silver sword light hit the godlight with pinpoint accuracy, but Lone Bamboo\u2019s destructive beam flew on anyway, completely unimpeded.\n\nThe moment the godlight touched its body, the Silver Destroyer seemed to freeze. It stood where it was, unmoving. Its sword hovered in mid-swing.\n\nWith a grin, Han Sen drew the Six Core Snake Bow, took aim, and fired at the Silver Destroyer. But the Silver Destroyer was moving again before Han Sen\u2019s arrow even found its target. The creature\u2019s small silver sword cut the arrow in half.\n\n\u201cThe godlight restraints don\u2019t last for long. We need to cooperate and time our strikes,\u201d Lone Bamboo said with a frown."
