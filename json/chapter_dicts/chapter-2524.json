    "text": "\u201cIn that case, I will give it a shot.\u201d Han Sen had passed his years of always wanting to win. He wasn\u2019t fond of Yellow Clothes\u2019 personality, at all. If he didn\u2019t have to hunt a core bronze tripod alongside her, that was more than fine with him.\n\n\u201cI can use whatever geno art I desire?\u201d Han Sen asked for confirmation.\n\n\u201cYes. You can use any geno art you want,\u201d Yellow Clothes answered with complete certainty as she turned away from Han Sen. She closed her eyes.\n\n\u201cOkay. I am going to start now.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Yellow Clothes said.\n\nBut after she said spoke, she didn\u2019t hear Han Sen make a move. After a while of not hearing anything, Yellow Clothes felt strange. She then heard Han Sen say, \u201cAlright, please guess what kind of geno art I used, lady.\u201d\n\nYellow Clothes smiled coldly. She turned around, looked at Han Sen, and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t move. I guess that can be considered a geno art, too.\u201d\n\nShe was pretty sure Han Sen hadn\u2019t moved or used a geno art.\n\nHan Sen smiled. \u201cI think you have guessed incorrectly this time. According to the terms of our deal, I can leave now, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d Yellow Clothes was very sure of that. The Very High Sense could sense everything. She could even sense the sneaky skills of some deified elites. Han Sen was just King class, so she was confident she would be able to feel anything that he did.\n\n\u201cYou say that you can\u2019t be wrong, but you won\u2019t tell me what geno art I used. You are being rather obstinate,\u201d Han Sen said in annoyance.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t use a geno art and you didn\u2019t move,\u201d Yellow Clothes said to Han Sen while looking at him. Her tone was held high by sheer confidence.\n\n\u201cI did move. And I did use a geno art. It isn\u2019t my problem if you are unable to guess what I used.\u201d Han Sen spread out both of his hands.\n\nYellow Clothes peered at Han Sen without speaking. After a while, she looked disappointed and she said, \u201cIn that case, you can go. I lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much for the convenience,\u201d Han Sen said. He took the bronze furnace with him and departed without another word.\n\nSeeing Han Sen leave, Yellow Clothes looked let down. She spoke to herself, \u201cPlaying tricks over such a small matter? It doesn\u2019t matter how talented he thinks he is; he didn\u2019t notice what he missed by playing this trick.\u201d\n\nYellow Clothes was certain her feelings hadn\u2019t been wrong. Han Sen hadn\u2019t moved or used a geno art. He was a complete con man. He had made such a bad impression that Yellow Clothes no longer wanted to deal with him.\n\nEvery member of the Very High was allowed to select a silkworm to grow. They had to choose carefully and go for the best of the best.\n\nDollar had powerful talents, but his behavior had disappointed Yellow Clothes. She didn\u2019t want to argue with him any further.\n\n\u201cHe has talent, but his personality and heart are terrible. What a shame.\u201d Putting the whole matter out of her mind, Yellow Clothes also turned to leave.\n\nSeeing Yellow Clothes return, Little Butterfly immediately came running out. She asked Yellow Clothes with proper surprise, \u201cMy Lady, you let Dollar go that fast?\u201d\n\nYellow Clothes had spent a lot of effort to get all the others that were waiting for Han Sen to leave. That was why she had been able to encounter Dollar alone. But right after she met Dollar, Yellow Clothes had hastily returned. Little Butterfly was surprised by this. She thought she would be gone at least three or four days before she came back.\n\n\u201cHe is not the silkworm I require,\u201d Yellow Clothes grumbled.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take one more look? Dollar is very strong. He was able to take down the Gold Armor General by himself. I don\u2019t think even Yu Shanxin could do that. It would be a shame to let this opportunity go by,\u201d Little Butterfly tried to convince her.\n\nYellow Clothes poured a cup of tea, took a sip, and said, \u201cHis talent and power are strong, but the geno universe is home to many geniuses like that. They just can\u2019t reach that perfect threshold. Plus, Dollar has a major flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of flaw would that be?\u201d Little Butterfly asked with curiosity.\n\n\u201cHis personality is bad. I don\u2019t like how his mind works,\u201d Yellow Clothes said while putting down her teacup.\n\n\u201cNo way. How long has it been, and you can already tell his personality is poor?\u201d Little Butterfly looked at her in disbelief.\n\nYellow Clothes told her what happened with Han Sen, and then Little Butterfly nodded, and said, \u201cMy Lady\u2019s Very High Sense is never incorrect, and that means Dollar\u2019s personality isn\u2019t that good. How dare he lie right before you? With a personality like that, he really cannot be your silkworm. But he does have talent and power. He is strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. A person like that won\u2019t be able to achieve the final step. Li Keer\u2019s silkworm must be the silkworm that can become a butterfly. There cannot be any flaws,\u201d Li Keer said in a hard voice.\n\n\u201cThat Dollar, why would he try to play a trick on you? If he knew that little trick had cost him so much, he would probably cry himself to death.\u201d Littler Butterfly sighed.\n\n\u201cMost people are stupid that way. Few can truly rise above the rest. You can\u2019t hold it against him. If everyone could be perfect, then that final step would not be so difficult,\u201d Li Keer said casually. She didn\u2019t seem too affected.\n\n\u201cYou are right, but I do think your standards are too high. All the other princes have selected a silkworm, and only you are left. You have visited many geniuses that you do not like. What kind of person will you consider acceptable?\u201d Little Butterfly was worried about Li Keer.\n\nLi Keer wasn\u2019t in a rush, though. \u201cI would rather lack one than pick the wrong one. If I cannot find a suitable silkworm, I would rather go without.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can that happen? If you don\u2019t choose, then you will lose your opportunity to become a leader.\u201d Little Butterfly was even more worried upon hearing that.\n\n\u201cI was just complaining; I didn\u2019t actually mean it. I need to choose someone. Otherwise, things will be too easy for the other princes. I am going to choose, but I\u2019ll choose someone I like.\u201d Li Keer laughed.\n\nLittle Butterfly let out a long sigh and stroked her chest, \u201cOh, you scared me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, now come and give me a massage. I have just moved a little and already my shoulders feel bad.\u201d Li Keer had another sip of tea.\n\nLittle Butterfly went behind Li Keer. She reached out to begin massaging Li Keer, but her hands stopped still in the air. She didn\u2019t touch her, but her mouth opened with shock. \u201cMy lady, you\u2026 your back has words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWords? What words?\u201d Li Keer was shocked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 lose\u2026\u201d Little Butterfly slowly read the words planted upon Li Keer\u2019s back.\n\nLi Keer\u2019s face turned red. She gnashed her teeth and reached out her hand. She summoned a mirror so that she could view her own back. There, she saw the two words written down upon her back. They were around the size of a fist. There was even an exclamation mark.\n\n\u201cYou lose!\u201d"
