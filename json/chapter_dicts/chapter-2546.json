They were sensitive enough that they noticed the glance that the man directed toward them.\n\nAlthough Han Sen saw it, he said nothing. Considering the beauty of the two women, it would be weird if men didn\u2019t have any reaction towards them.\n\nThe Demon and humans looked alike. Their definitions of pretty were similar, so it wasn\u2019t strange that a Demon man would be drawn to the appearance of a human woman.\n\nAttraction was one thing, but it would be a different matter if the Demons tried to make a move. If Ji Yang Sheng didn\u2019t do anything stupid, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t begin a conflict himself.\n\nJi Yang Sheng turned away from Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, then said to Han Sen, \u201cTeacher Han, Mister Moldo might have spoken to you before about how he hoped that you could bless me. Do you have time now?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, Moldo mentioned that.\u201d Han Sen went quiet for a moment, then he told Ji Yang Sheng, \u201cI told Mr. Moldo before that my blessings can affect others, but I cannot make people deified. Becoming deified is all about the potential of one\u2019s genes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, but I would be very grateful if you were willing to try to help me. Whether we succeed or not, it is the thought and effort that counts.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng was maintaining his politeness quite well.\n\nHan Sen laughed. \u201cThere is no need to say that. We are merely trading. I will still charge you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is okay. Tell me if there is something you want. If I can pay it, I won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng responded quickly.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cWe can talk about the price later. I haven\u2019t yet fully recovered from the blessing I gave Lando. It will take another four months for me to recover enough that I can bless someone else. We can talk about it then.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Han Sen could use his Blood-Pulse Sutra power whenever. That didn\u2019t mean he wanted to keep using it, though. If he did, its value would drop off substantially.\n\nUp until now, Han Sen had only used it on Lando, Gu Qingcheng, and Elysian Moon. He wanted to use it on Little Silver, too. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t use it on Bao\u2019er or Ling\u2019er, because they were so talented themselves. They had so many possibilities, and the use of the Blood-Pulse Sutra could limit their development.\n\nLittle Silver\u2019s talents were a bit on the weak side. The Blood-Pulse Sutra could only do good for him.\n\n\u201cOkay. If you don\u2019t mind, though, I can protect you. I won\u2019t let anyone disturb whatever you are doing in the meantime,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng said with a look of sincerity.\n\n\u201cThank you, but no thank you. We are only here to hunt xenogeneics. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for us to be together.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want a bunch of people following him.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will contact you at a later date. This is my contact information. If you need anything, all you have to do is ask,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng said, before taking his people with him to depart. He didn\u2019t say anything about wanting to loot xenogeneics.\n\nAfter Ji Yang Sheng left, Elysian Moon coldly grunted and said, \u201cThat guy doesn\u2019t seem very likable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will probably end up meeting a lot of other people you hate,\u201d Han Sen said, with a shrug of his shoulders. Their own beauty might have been their biggest challenge.\n\nIn that universe, many races looked just like humans, including the Rebate, the Demons, the Sky, and the Extreme King, to name a few. Their definition of beauty was quite similar, and so the two girls were undoubtedly quite eye-catching to those of such races.\n\n\u201cFrom what we have seen, we should learn from Dollar and wear armor,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said, glancing at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid wearing armor won\u2019t help. Your bodies are quite distinctive, and even if others cannot see your faces, your curves are sure to attract men. Your appearance makes quite an impact.\u201d Han Sen laughed.\n\n\u201cIf we are that sexy, why aren\u2019t you affected by us?\u201d Elysian Moon asked, quirking her lips into a half-smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different. People like me are so faithful and loyal. I\u2019m just a good man, so a few looks here and there keep me happy. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll never meet another man like me in the universe,\u201d Han Sen joked.\n\nGu Qingcheng smiled but said nothing. Elysian Moon looked at him with disdain, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re just a creep who has no balls. You call yourself a good man? Pff.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she ignored Han Sen and resumed her flight.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her? Since when did I become a creep?\u201d Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng.\n\nGu Qingcheng laughed and raised an eyebrow at him. Not saying another word, she flew after Elysian Moon.\n\n\u201cHey, what is wrong with you both?\u201d Han Sen was so depressed. Although Gu Qingcheng said nothing, he felt as if he had been bullied.\n\nJi Yang Sheng and his Demon allies didn\u2019t venture far. When Han Sen and the others departed, Ji Yang Sheng spoke to a King in his entourage and said, \u201cYou go home and bring me my Demon Doll. If my father asks, tell him I need it.\u201d\n\nThe Demon King was shocked, and so he said, \u201cAre you going to attack Han Sen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that I encountered him here. This is a very rare opportunity. We were unable to find him in the systems of chaos, but now we have a second chance to snare him,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng said in a hard voice.\n\n\u201cPlease think about this, sir! The Extreme King sent deifieds after him, and even they were unable to capture him. Only half-deifieds can come to the core area. I don\u2019t think you have what it takes to catch Han Sen. If he knows that we have tried to snare him, I do not think he will ever spare the time to bless you,\u201d the Demon said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to use the Demon Doll; it is deified. Attacking Han Sen will be a guaranteed success. And even if it fails, Han Sen will have no clue it was us who used it,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng stated flatly.\n\n\u201cBut the Demon Doll is the Demon\u2019s\u2026\u201d The Demon King wished to say something, but Ji Yang Sheng cut him off.\n\n\u201cJust bring me the doll and stop your protesting,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng snapped.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d The Demon King didn\u2019t dare disobey a direct command. He opened his core area hall and returned to the Demon Realm.\n\nAn hour later, the core area hall\u2019s door opened again. The Demon had returned, but with someone else in tow.\n\nIf anyone else had seen this, they would have been very surprised. Kings could only use their power to open a personal door to the core area. No other creature should have been able to enter through that same door. That Demon King brought a creature through the door with him. Even the Extreme King wouldn\u2019t have been able to believe their eyes if they had seen this."
