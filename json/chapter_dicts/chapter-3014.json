Han Sen was depressed, so he asked, \u201cWhat is the situation now? Is there a way to take the blue blood power out of my body?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer a few of my questions first.\u201d Han Yufei did not wait for Han Sen to agree. She immediately asked, \u201cYou come from the sanctuaries, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Han Sen nodded. There was no real point in hiding it now.\n\nHan Yufei looked at Han Sen with interest as she asked, \u201cYou are a mix of crystallizer and Sacred Leader\u2019s blood, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Although Han Sen agreed with the assessment, it was not something he could believe in 100%.\n\n\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Han Yufei told Han Sen with absolute certainty.\n\nHan Sen did not understand and asked, \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\nHan Yufei coldly said, \u201cBecause it was me who was in charge of Sacred Leader\u2019s research into the blood. Only I researched Sacred blood, and only my assistant saw some. Without that information, no race\u2019s blood can be combined Sacred Leader\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour assistant\u2026 Crystallizer\u2026\u201d Han Sen suddenly noticed something. Han Yufei once told him that after the crystallizers had their genes modified, they would become more intelligent. So, Han Yufei and Sacred Leader hired them as test assistants.\n\n\u201cYes. It was a crystallizer. If you are a crystallizer and you can combine with blue blood, it is without a doubt that you are a crystallizer mix that contains Sacred Leader\u2019s blood. Because the research was not a total success, combining with Sacred Leader\u2019s blood was very weak. It did not affect the natural blood of a crystallizer. People would not be able to tell, so they would just assume you to be a crystallizer.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei paused and smiled before saying, \u201cI cannot believe Left Crazy was that smart. He only saw that little bit of information, yet he was able to do this. It must have been very hard for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I am a mix of crystallizer and Sacred, what is the connection with Nine-Life Cat?\u201d Han Sen asked. \u201cNine-Life Cat, Ghost Car, Phoenix, and Holy Kirin were the four holy beasts of Sacred. In fact, they were important research for Sacred Leader. It is different from researching with Super Gene. The research on the four holy beasts was about making the creatures of the universe holy spirits and turning them into new creatures that could rival God Spirits. Only Holy Kirin was a success. The other three holy beasts were not a success. That was especially true with the Nine-Life Cat. There was some problem in the process.\u201d\n\nUl\n\nSpeaking of that, Han Yufei looked solemn. She went silent and did not continue speaking. \u201cWas there a problem?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s expression showed that he was in a rush. He had been chasing this for many years, and he was finally on the cusp of learning the truth. His desire for finding this out was something no one could understand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Han Yufei\u2019s answer almost made Han Sen jump.\n\n\u201cHow could you not know?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide. He stared at Han Yufei.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know. The process of making a holy spirit was dangerous. In the test, Nine-Life Cat was injected with too much spirit. His spirit could not take it, so he broke. Therefore, he died. His body had no lifeforce. After that, Sacred Leader took Nine-Life Cat\u2019s body away.\u201d\n\nAfter saying that, Han Yufei looked at Han Sen. \u201cI only found out from you now that Nine-Life Cat did not die, and his blood is close to blue blood. That should be impossible.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had a strange expression. He had many thoughts swirling through his head, but he screamed, \u201cWhat you are saying is that Nine-Life Cat was revived because of Sacred Leader! Does that mean Nine-Life Cat is\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Han Sen said anything else, he thought that possibility was too shocking.\n\nHan Yufei nodded and said, \u201cFrom what I guess, there are two possibilities. One is that it is just as you say. Perhaps Sacred Leader used Nine-Life Cat\u2019s body to conduct more tests, and Nine-Life Cat became a vessel for him. The other possibility is that Sacred Leader used his blood. He gave it to Nine-Life Cat and then, somehow, Nine-Life Cat was revived as a new type of species. Only that could explain why the Nine-Life Cat\u2019s gene power is so similar to Sacred Leader\u2019s blue blood. That is why Nine-Life Cat\u2019s power can combat blue blood power. Only Sacred power can restrict Sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich do you think is the likelier result?\u201d Han Sen looked weird. He thought about the demon lady before she died. She told him to be wary of Old Cat. Now, that was starting to seem very interesting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Han Yufei turned off the machine and let Han Sen exit the chamber.\n\nHan Sen stretched his body as he asked, \u201cIs there a way to erase the blue blood inside me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe genes are combined, so it is impossible to erase it now,\u201d Han Yufei excitedly said. \u201cWhy would you want to get rid of it? If it is just blue blood power, that would be very bad. But your body has Nine-Life Cat\u2019s mutated blue blood genes. These mutated blue blood genes will not be destroyed by the rules of the universe. You just need to combine the two powers into one. Then, you can perfectly get a hold of it and will be a Sacred Leader that will not be destroyed by the rules of the universe. You can achieve more than what Sacred Leader did. By then, you would not need the Super Gene to kill God Spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to kill God Spirits?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nHan Sen had tried to be a God Spirit. Although God Spirits were a bit dangerous, it was not like they had to be destroyed.\n\nRegarding the harm, when every race was making themselves stronger, the crimes they committed were worse than the God Spirits. The harm they caused was greater than anything the God Spirits did.\n\nUnless he was born an enemy of the God Spirits, he really did not see the point in killing God Spirits.\n\nHan Yufei looked at Han Sen weirdly. After a while, she sighed. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand the God Spirits and what they are. If you understood, you would feel the same way.\u201d \u201cYou can make me understand.\u201d Han Sen looked at Han Yufei with eyes that were on fire.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to explain so suddenly.\u201d Han Yufei clearly did not want to answer that question. She changed the subject and said, \u201cYou should stay here. I will find a way for you to control the blue blood power. As for the removal of the blue blood, I do not think I can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter successfully combining with it, can I use the old geno arts I have?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d Han Yufei said. \u201cSacred blood\u2019s gene power is too powerful. Even if you did not get destroyed, you could not run it with other geno arts. You can only use this power, but that is enough.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had an odd expression as he asked, \u201cAre you sure that after having Sacred blood power, I cannot use other powers?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. I thought you have experienced this,\u201d Han Yufei said.\n\n\u201cBy the way, I am very interested in learning more about Han Jinzhi. Tell me more about him.\u201d Han Yufei squinted her eyes.\n\n\u201cSure. As a trade, I want to know what God Spirits are,\u201d Han Sen calmly said.\n\nHan Yufei looked at Han Sen seriously for a while and said, \u201cSure. I can try to explain, but I cannot promise that you will understand.\u201d"
