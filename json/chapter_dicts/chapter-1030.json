    "text": "Han Sen, browsing the aisles of the supermarket, held Bao\u2019er in his arms. He had spent so much time in the sanctuary, returning to the conveniences of civilization made for a nice change of pace.\n\nBao\u2019er and Han Sen each had an ice cream, and they were delicious.\n\n\u201cTeacher Qu, Lanxi?\u201d Han Sen caught sight of two people who were familiar to him.\n\nOne of them was a very elegant woman. Her full name was Qu Wange, and she was a lecturer at Saint Paul college. The other woman was Qu Lanxi, who Han Sen had met in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cHan Sen?\u201d They were both quite surprised.\n\nHan Sen was also surprised, especially at seeing them both together. They seemed rather close with each other.\n\n\u201cYou two are good friends?\u201d Han Sen guessed, unsure of the exact nature of their relationship.\n\n\u201cLanxi is my big sister; I didn\u2019t realize that you knew her.\u201d Qu Wange smiled.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, Lanxi helped me out a lot. I just didn\u2019t expect you both to be sisters.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nQu Lanxi blushed and said, \u201cAre you sure it was I who helped you? It was thanks to you that Chu Ming and I were able to return here.\u201d\n\nQu Wange chimed in to say, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me it was San Mu who helped you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am San Mu.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cCome to my home for dinner tonight, then. Our parents would really like to meet, greet, and thank the person who saved my sister,\u201d Qu Wange said.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for that,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI have wanted to do this for a long time; so, if you really aren\u2019t busy, I would much appreciate it if we could have a get-together,\u201d Qu Lanxi pleaded.\n\n\u201cAll right, then.\u201d They had endured many hardships together, so Han Sen wasn\u2019t entirely against joining her for a night.\n\n\u201cIs that your daughter, by the way? She\u2019s cute,\u201d Qu Wange asked.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er? No, she\u2019s just a humanoid pet beast soul. I treat her as if she was my daughter, though.\u201d Han Sen had started to use that as an explanation for what Bao\u2019er was, masking her true, enigmatic identity.\n\nIf it became known that Bao\u2019er was a creature of sorts, one that could actually come to the Alliance, people would undoubtedly freak out. A ruckus would ensue, all with Han Sen back in the limelight again.\n\nIf there were other creatures that could come to the Alliance, things would be far more dangerous for humans.\n\nAnd what\u2019s more, he feared Bao\u2019er might be taken away by the government if her nature was exposed. As such, he kept it a secret.\n\n\u201cThat must be quite rare.\u201d They looked at Bao\u2019er with much surprise.\n\nBao\u2019er reached out and said, \u201cBeautiful aunties\u2026 hug me.\u201d\n\nImmediately, they were both smitten with Bao\u2019er. They did not mind that it was a pet beast soul, as they had been told, and were keen to treat it like any ordinary baby.\n\nWhile Bao\u2019er could be sweet and had the naivety of an actual child, after the time he had spent with her in the sanctuary, Han Sen had come to know that Bao\u2019er had an evil streak within her. She wasn\u2019t entirely innocent.\n\nBao\u2019er could even command Moment Queen to do things for her.\n\nAfter Bao\u2019er\u2019s introduction to Qu Lanxi and Qu Wange, the baby was able to obtain many things Han Sen usually forbade. She had put on a front of being as adorable as possible, getting the two she referred to as aunties to buy her many things. Much of this stuff was just junk food.\n\nHan Sen thought it was a waste, buying her such food. He believed it would be useless for her development.\n\nFurthermore, Han Sen didn\u2019t like spending too much, either. And with Bao\u2019er\u2019s belly being like a black hole, she could eat and eat and never be satisfied. He couldn\u2019t risk spoiling her.\n\nBut on this day, those two girls greatly enjoyed feeding Bao\u2019er whatever she requested.\n\n\u201cHave you been abusing her? Why is she so hungry?\u201d Qu Wange stared at Han Sen with trepidation.\n\nHan Sen shrugged and thought to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s all fun, lollipops, and kisses for now. If only you had to take care of her for a few days, you\u2019d understand how difficult she is to take care of.\u201d\n\nAfter their time shopping was over, Qu Wange drove Han Sen and Bao\u2019er to their house.\n\nTheir parents greeted Han Sen very passionately. They were so grateful Han Sen had been able to deliver Qu Lanxi back to the Alliance without harm, after her many-year absence.\n\nWhile Han Sen was in deep discussion with her parents, Qu Lanxi took Bao\u2019er up to her room.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, does this dress look good on me?\u201d Qu Lanxi asked, after placing Bao\u2019er on her bed.\n\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re too old,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, with squinted eyes.\n\nQu Lanxi froze, utterly dazed from the response she had received from a baby. Her attitude was most certainly different than when she was around Han Sen. It was as if her cuteness had entirely evaporated.\n\n\u201cYou are so old. And to wear such old-fashioned clothes, it\u2019s no wonder you haven\u2019t married yet. You\u2019ll never wed anyone if you carry on like this.\u201d Bao\u2019er spoke with a deep, serious, and rough tone, all while she sucked her dummy.\n\nQu Lanxi had not expected a pet baby to insult her this way.\n\nBao\u2019er placed her little hands below her jaw and said, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get married. Of course, if you aren\u2019t against the concept, I can get my daddy to be your husband for a temporary period of time. You\u2019ll just have to buy me good stuff for the duration.\u201d\n\nQu Lanxi was still frozen, with her wide eyes staring at Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er seemed to be adding something up with her fingers, and eventually, she said, \u201cDaddy is popular, so this is going to cost you at least two hundred ice creams.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen was ready to leave, the sisters looked at him strangely. They avoided eye contact and didn\u2019t even bid him goodbye.\n\nBut before they left, Qu Lanxi gave a lot of food to Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, did you do something to offend your two aunties?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI behaved,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, as she munched on jelly.\n\nHan Sen went home to rest for the next two days, but Lin Weiwei sent him a message. It told him that a person had come to the shelter and that he would like to meet Han Sen in the virtual community."
