    "text": "Han Sen felt something very powerful coming his way. His body leaned back reflexively, trying to get away from it. The blonde girl leaped on top of him.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t move as the girl jumped and wrapped her arms around Han Sen\u2019s neck, her weight slamming into his chest and taking him to the ground. They both became entangled, just as the fifth picture on the screen had shown.\n\nHan Sen had prepared himself for the inevitable fight, and as they fell, Han Sen\u2019s eyes started to turn white as he summoned his super god spirit body.\n\n\u201cBig brother\u2026 Wan\u2019er has been waiting for you to come back!\u201d The blonde girl was riding Han Sen hard, and she now wore a beautiful smile. She clutched his face, lowered her head, and kissed Han Sen on the forehead.\n\nHan Sen was stunned. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the glowing white in his eyes started to recede.\n\nHan Sen was still trying to summon his super god spirit body, but it vanished after the girl kissed him.\n\nSomething else disappeared, too; the blonde girl\u2019s golden light rapidly faded into nothing. The blonde hair that had shone like a sun was now like a fire that had been extinguished. It darkened until she had a full head of black hair. Even her golden pupils were now as dark as ink.\n\n\u201cI can finally be with big brother again.\u201d Wan\u2019er pulled herself back upright, sitting on Han Sen\u2019s chest. She looked at Han Sen with her beautiful smile.\n\nThat sweet and happy smile made Han Sen freeze. At that moment, she looked so incredibly innocent.\n\nThe next second, her eyelids fluttered closed. She looked soft as she slumped down on Han Sen\u2019s chest, and a few seconds later, she lost consciousness.\n\n\u201cHey, hey. Lady, you have it wrong. I\u2019m not your big brother.\u201d Han Sen shifted the girl who referred to herself as Wan\u2019er, sliding his arms under her as he climbed back to his feet.\n\nHer skin appeared smooth, and it was very soft. Han Sen could no longer feel her scary presence and power. Her lifeforce had dropped to a tiny fraction of what it had been. Now she was as weak as a commoner in this universe, or perhaps even weaker.\n\nIf Han Sen hadn\u2019t seen her transform with his own eyes, he never would\u2019ve imagined that this black-haired girl was the blonde girl who had taken out the deified Night Wind in a single blow.\n\nHan Sen realized that the tattoo of the Nine-Life Cat on her back was now gone. The skin of her back was smooth and white as if the tattoo had never existed in the first place.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Han Sen frowned. When he scanned the girl, he confirmed that she had passed out, but she was still alive. Her lifeforce was so low that it was concerning, however. It was hard to imagine how she had been able to blast out the scary power she had used earlier.\n\n\u201cLady, wake up!\u201d Han Sen pressed his finger to her lips to see if she really was in a coma or if she was just pretending instead.\n\nBut he quickly pulled his finger back, startled. The girl Wan\u2019er didn\u2019t wake up, and her pink skin was bleeding where Han Sen had pressed his finger, as if her skin was fragile and paper-thin.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t even used strength. With the strength she had previously demonstrated, there should have been no way for Han Sen to leave a mark on her body, even if he used his full strength. But he had just slightly tapped her lips, and now the skin was broken and bleeding. She was no longer what she had been when she first woke up.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s going on with her?\u201d Han Sen looked at the girl weirdly.\n\nMiss Mirror eventually got back to her feet. She picked up the broken sword and tried to stab Lady Wan\u2019er.\n\nHan Sen tightened his arms around the girl and dodged. Miss Mirror directed a hard stare at him. \u201cWhat are you doing? Now is the best time to kill her. If she wakes up and becomes that blonde b*tch again, we won\u2019t be able to kill her. Then we\u2019ll be the ones to die.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned and looked at the girl. He had thought about doing this, as well.\n\nHe knew Miss Mirror was right. The girl\u2019s body was like that of an average person right now. A random strike could kill her. This really was their best chance.\n\nIf she woke up and engaged her blondie mode, he and Miss Mirror would be unable to touch her. They might be in grave danger.\n\nIn the sixth picture, there were only two faceless people. That meant one of them was gone. If they didn\u2019t kill the blonde girl now, that meant one of them would have to die. What happened next might be a conflict between Han Sen and Miss Mirror.\n\nBecause of all these things, killing the girl really seemed like the best choice. It would certainly sort out many of their current troubles, and it could heighten their chances for survival.\n\nBut Han Sen still hesitated. What Wan\u2019er said to Han Sen before she fainted made him think. He didn\u2019t think he was actually Wan\u2019er\u2019s big brother, but killing a girl who wasn\u2019t currently hostile and couldn\u2019t fight back was something Han Sen couldn\u2019t make himself do.\n\nAnd there was one thing that really did nag at him. His super god spirit body was supposed to be invincible, but the girl\u2019s power had been able to cancel its activation. He was really confused about what had happened there.\n\nHis super god spirit power hadn\u2019t been destroyed, just pushed back. Han Sen could activate the super god spirit body again, but the girl had done something that he had never experienced before. He cared deeply about what it could mean.\n\nMiss Mirror knew what Han Sen was thinking. She lifted the sword and pointed it at the girl, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t get fooled by what she said. She probably knew she couldn\u2019t last long, and that\u2019s why she said it. She wanted to give you a reason to keep her alive. Shouldn\u2019t you know that she isn\u2019t your real sister?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t my sister, but I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Han Sen took off his jacket and covered the girl\u2019s body.\n\nThe girl could have killed him, but she hadn\u2019t. Han Sen knew that things were not as Miss Mirror was saying.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot do it, then I will do it!\u201d Miss Mirror growled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is something I would like to ask her. Let\u2019s decide once she has woken up,\u201d Han Sen said as he held the girl.\n\n\u201cYou are a gentleman, but you seem to have forgotten what the sixth picture depicts.\u201d Miss Mirror laughed darkly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t forget. But you really don\u2019t think that can predict our future, do you?\u201d Han Sen asked calmly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it can predict our future, but everything predicted by the prior pictures came true. We have to be careful,\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\nHan Sen knew Miss Mirror was correct. He sighed and said, \u201cYou should just go. Let me handle this. I will continue to explore. Even if the prophetic picture is correct, it doesn\u2019t say that whoever isn\u2019t in the picture ends up dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and I have exchanged minds. You know what my personality is like.\u201d Miss Mirror didn\u2019t move. She raised the sword and pointed it at the girl in Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\nHan Sen knew Miss Mirror\u2019s personality well. She was ambitious, and that ambition compelled her to control every scenario. She wouldn\u2019t allow others to dictate what course her future would take. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have gone to the stone fields in the first place. She only had to send Han Sen, Night Wind, or even Red Cloud.\n\n\u201cMy Lady, can\u2019t you see that we are walking right into that prophecy?\u201d Han Sen looked at Miss Mirror. He had never believed in the prophecy anyway."
