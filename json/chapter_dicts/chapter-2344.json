    "text": "\u201cSure, I\u2019d go with you to steal things from Destiny\u2019s Tower. If I was insane,\u201d Han Sen mumbled to himself. He had no intention of cooperating with Fox Queen.\n\nFor now, his identity hadn\u2019t yet been exposed. He could still deny any allegations that came up, but stealing something from Destiny\u2019s Tower was akin to asking for death.\n\n\u201cMy Prince! My Prince!\u201d Han Sen was planning on hunting down some Duke xenogeneics when he heard Lilly\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to kill some monsters to collect xenogeneics genes. Can\u2019t you just leave me alone for a bit?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. That Siren servant Lilly was coming after him, repeatedly calling out for her prince.\n\nLilly was a Siren, too, but she had been raised by Bai Yi\u2019s mother. She wasn\u2019t with Lan Haixin. As a result, she was the only servant that Bai Yi had.\n\nPerhaps Lilly still remembered that Bai Yi\u2019s mother had been good to her, and that was why she decided to stick with Bai Yi. She was really loyal to him, and her only goal was to serve him well. It was rare to witness such loyalty.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, it is good that you are here\u2026 the Sentence Court\u2026 the Sentence Court\u2019s people are here\u2026 They\u2026 They said the blood kirin went against the rules of King\u2019s Garden\u2026\u201d Lilly swam to him, gasping as she spoke.\n\nHan Sen frowned and said, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\nThe blood kirin had killed Prince Swordstar\u2019s guard in King\u2019s Garden. Han Sen knew that incident would come back to bite him. He just didn\u2019t expect the turnaround to have happened so quickly.\n\n\u201cThey are in Ocean Hall. The princess is greeting them right now. She wants you to return so that you can provide them with an explanation,\u201d Lilly said.\n\n\u201cOkay. I will go and talk to them, then.\u201d Han Sen had to give up on his plans for hunting right now. He followed Lilly back to Underwater Town.\n\nLan Haixin was sitting in the palace, her face expressionless. She didn\u2019t look good.\n\nHan Sen had been hiding in the garden, and she had dealt with all the nobles that came visiting. If she didn\u2019t need Han Sen to open the Siren relic, she wouldn\u2019t have cared about him at all.\n\nNow, though, the people from the Sentence Court were visiting. This wasn\u2019t something she could handle alone, and so she had to let Han Sen deal with these matters by himself.\n\nLan Haixin didn\u2019t know how Bai Yi had earned the Kingese protection, but she knew how easily he could cause trouble.\n\n\u201cIt was so hard for me to get a half-deified guard, and it has caused so much trouble. The killing in King\u2019s Garden has brought the Sentence Court knocking on our door. There is no way he will be allowed to keep the blood kirin,\u201d Haixin thought to herself.\n\n\u201cWho is looking for me?\u201d Han Sen brought the blood kirin in with him from the outside.\n\n\u201cI am Chu Nan from the Sentence Court, My Prince.\u201d The half-deified elite in the lobby slowly bowed to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAh, it is Courtman Chu. Why have you come looking for me?\u201d Han Sen knew, but he asked anyway.\n\nChu Nan signaled to a man next to him. The servant presented Han Sen with a document. Chu Nan himself said, \u201cI am so sorry, My Prince. Your blood kirin murdered Prince Swordstar\u2019s guard in King\u2019s Garden. Prince Swordstar told us in the Sentence Court. We are here to arrest him, so please forgive us.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the two servants came forward to arrest the blood kirin. But Han Sen stopped them.\n\nChu Nan quietly said, \u201cMy Prince, this is an order that comes directly from the Sentence Court. Please do not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. If we cannot bring him back today, then it will force the captain to visit. Then, things will be far worse.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not making anything complicated. The blood kirin is my guard, and I\u2019m the one that commanded it to kill in King\u2019s Garden. So, I am the leader that caused this. The crime is mine. I will go with you. There are rules, and I need to be judged. I am a prince, so I should follow the law.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen reached out his hands. He told Chu Nan he could lock him up so they could leave.\n\nChu Nan and the others were shocked. People had been killed in King\u2019s Garden before, and the princes were usually responsible, but they always pinned the murders on their guards. But now, this was in reverse. The prince was taking the crime for the guard. They looked flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cIn that case, My Prince, we are so sorry. We do not need to cuff you. Please, just come with us.\u201d Chu Nan didn\u2019t formally arrest Han Sen, but he didn\u2019t plan to let him go, either.\n\nThe Sentence Court was allowed to lock up figures of royalty. If Han Sen wanted to take responsibility for the crime, then Chu Nan wouldn\u2019t stop him.\n\nThere were connections between Prince Swordstar and the Sentence Court. What happened with the blood kirin required an explanation. It would have been great if Bai Yi really had committed the crime, as he would have felt much better.\n\nLan Haixin watched Han Sen and the blood kirin get taken away. She looked sick, and she said, \u201cIs that guy crazy? He is going to jail on behalf of some silly mount. He has lost all his pride as a prince.\u201d\n\nHan Sen followed Chu Nan to the Sentence Court. He was locked in the prison there, and he had to wait for the trial before being sent to the proper penitentiary.\n\n\u201cBai Yi is going to take the crime that he murdered in King\u2019s Garden. Is he crazy?\u201d Prince Swordstar, when he heard this news, was shocked.\n\nBut then, a wide smile crossed his face. He said, \u201cThat is good. If he wants to die, then we just let him. Murdering in the King\u2019s Garden will have him stuck in prison for a hundred years, even if he is a prince.\u201d\n\nThe Sentence Court captain, who was trimming a fern, heard what the prince said and laughed. \u201cIf it was an ordinary noble, they would be served a death sentence. But he is a Prince, and it was a guard that was killed. He will probably be in jail for a dozen years. It is hard to tell exactly how long, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen years is still good.\u201d Prince Swordstar rolled his eyes and went on to say, \u201cRight, just don\u2019t let that blood kirin go, either. Does he think he can save everyone? Who does he think he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. The laws of the Extreme King are fair. We will not wrong a good man. We will not let go of a bad man,\u201d the Sentence Court captain said coldly.\n\nChu Nan brought Han Sen and the blood kirin to jail. He opened the door and said, \u201cMy Prince, I am sorry that you have to live here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t walk inside. He looked at Chu Nan and said, \u201cMister Chu, can I ask a favor of you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chu Nan looked conflicted.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing big. Can I have him in the same prison cell as me?\u201d Han Sen stroked the blood kirin\u2019s head as he spoke.\n\n\u201cThat is okay\u2026\u201d Chu Nan looked at Han Sen strangely. Hesitantly, he said, \u201cMy Prince\u2026 are you really planning on accepting responsibility for this crime?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to, but I\u2019m afraid others will not allow me to,\u201d Han Sen said simply.\n\nChu Nan was confused. He understood Bai Yi\u2019s situation. Although he had done two things that shocked the entirety of the Extreme King, that couldn\u2019t pardon him from the crime. Since the guard had been killed, Han Sen would end up going to prison if Prince Swordstar did not relent.\n\nEven if it was the crown prince that stood accused, he would get a guard to admit the crime. If he confessed to the crime like Han Sen, he would end up going to jail, as well."
