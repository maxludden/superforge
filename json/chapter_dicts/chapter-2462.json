    "text": "Han Sen didn\u2019t speak. He quickly turned around and activated his Area.\n\nHan Sen caught his breath. The woman was standing not too far behind Han Sen, and she was smiling.\n\nHer lifeforce was very strong now, and as far as he could tell, it was identical to that of the woman in the wooden house. He could barely believe that this was the body that had been lying on the ground only moments before.\n\n\u201cWhat? We parted ways such a short time ago, and you\u2019ve already forgotten me?\u201d The woman smiled.\n\nHan Sen opened his mouth to ask if the woman before him was a human or a ghost, but then he remembered that the other woman had told him that under no circumstances should he speak. He still didn\u2019t understand what was up with this other woman, but he didn\u2019t talk. He simply looked at her.\n\nThe woman laughed and said, \u201cYou are being careful. I told you that you couldn\u2019t talk when you were in the presence of the light, but now that I\u2019m free, you can go ahead and speak.\u201d\n\nHan Sen still didn\u2019t say a word. He just stared at the woman, stunned by how similar the two were. Aside from wearing different clothes, they looked precisely the same.\n\nHan Sen really wanted to ask her what was going on, but he didn\u2019t dare speak. He thought about it some more, and he decided to write down some words with his Ghost Teeth Knife. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being very careful.\u201d The woman chuckled darkly. \u201cThis is my real body. It was trapped here. What you met earlier was just a doll with my spirit inside it. How else do you think I have managed to live so long? Not many beings from the era of Sacred are still alive. Anyone that has survived this long is most likely making use of forbidden skills.\u201d\n\nHan Sen carved more words into the ground. \u201cYou suppressed your body here?\u201d\n\nThe woman lifted her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt myself, so why would I bind myself here? Someone else did this to me, and so my real body was trapped here. But because of that suppression, my body didn\u2019t age. It still looks the same as it did back then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you find anyone else to dig up your body before me?\u201d Han Sen asked by carving more words.\n\n\u201cAre you done yet? If you don\u2019t want to go, that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m leaving,\u201d the woman said. She proceeded to walk down the mountain, ignoring Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen had almost broken through the entire mountaintop, but the woman was descending quickly from the mountain. She obviously intended to leave the island. He didn\u2019t know if he should finish digging or chase after her.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and ignored the woman who was leaving the island. He continued digging into the mountain.\n\nThat woman walked toward the light, and when she reached out to it, the light flew into her hands. Grabbing that light, the woman moved away from the island.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. The light had brought him here, and if the woman left with the light, Han Sen didn\u2019t know if he would still be able to leave.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t a saint, and he wasn\u2019t close to the woman in the wooden house. He wouldn\u2019t give his life up for her.\n\nGritting his teeth, Han Sen went after the departing woman.\n\nHan Sen shook his head but didn\u2019t speak. He looked at the woman\u2019s hand, and he saw that she was still holding the light she had stolen.\n\nHan Sen moved a bit closer, and he noticed that the light was actually a red lantern. The woman held the red lantern before her as she traveled through the clouds.\n\nShe was wearing yellow clothing, but her feet were bare. With the red light shining across her as she flew, she looked very weird.\n\nHan Sen followed her from behind, but still, he didn\u2019t speak. The woman clutched the lantern, continuing to move forward. She was moving much more smoothly than Han Sen.\n\nBut just as Han Sen was wondering if the woman knew where they were going, something bright appeared in front of him. They moved out of the clouds and approached an island.\n\nSince he couldn\u2019t see the peak, Han Sen didn\u2019t know which island he was seeing. So, he didn\u2019t speak.\n\nThe woman made her way up the mountain, and Han Sen followed her silently. When they were halfway up, Han Sen could feel that the mountain would have no peak. He felt as if there would be a wooden house and a garden.\n\n\u201cAre we really back here?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He walked all the way to the mountaintop and confirmed his suspicion.\n\nThe woman walked into the garden, heading for the wooden house. Han Sen followed the woman into the house.\n\nHan Sen thought something was amiss. The woman in the wooden house loved to clean, and she had a severe case of OCD. He wasn\u2019t allowed to walk in her garden, let alone her house.\n\nBut Han Sen had followed this woman all the way into the wooden house. She hadn\u2019t said a word, and that made Han Sen suspicious.\n\n\u201cIs she really not that woman? Is this a fake version of the island, then?\u201d Han Sen frowned as he looked around the wooden house.\n\nFrom the first floor to the second floor, there was no one else except for the woman holding the lantern. Han Sen picked up a pen and wrote on a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cWhere is your clone doll?\u201d\n\nHe watched her intently to see what her reaction might suggest. Han Sen didn\u2019t really need an answer to this question, but he wanted to see her reaction to him messing with her things.\n\nThe woman looked at the paper and said, \u201cMy real self is free. So, my clone is now gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds untrue,\u201d Han Sen thought. The woman hadn\u2019t been bothered by Han Sen\u2019s use of her pen and paper. That made him really suspicious.\n\nHan Sen looked at the stone book and found that it was still locked tightly shut. He hesitated to do so, but he held the book out in front of her. He wrote on the paper, \u201cCan you take a look at this book and help me break these bindings?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to help you?\u201d The woman asked with a raised eyebrow. She didn\u2019t accept the book.\n\nHan Sen now knew that this version of the woman was fake. The woman had personally given him the stone book. If this woman wearing yellow clothes was real, she would have recognized this book, and she wouldn\u2019t have said something like that.\n\n\u201cWhat to do?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He knew that this woman was fake, but the wooden house was the same. Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure how to proceed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t really care who this woman was. Real or fake, it didn\u2019t matter to him.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t want to just leave things like this. There were secrets right in front of his nose, and yet he couldn\u2019t uncover them.\n\nAs Han Sen tried to figure out what to do, he suddenly heard the roar of a big dragon. A giant purple dragon soared through the sky above the island.\n\nAtop the giant dragon was a man from the Extreme King."
