    "text": "The Six-Eared Macaque was deified, and Han Sen wasn\u2019t being supported by any treasures. In the eyes of the monkey, he was a barebones half-deified. The monkey didn\u2019t bother dodging Han Sen\u2019s strike, and so Han Sen\u2019s attack swept over it. The monkey had become too eager with the thought of tearing Han Sen to pieces.\n\nBut when the Xuan Yellow Sutra\u2019s power came upon it, the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body shook. Its blood-pulse reversed, and its power just disappeared. Its body and fur were changing, shriveling as if it was dying.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here\u2026\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque saw its body withering away, more and more. It looked horrified.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t answer. He calmly looked upon the Six-Eared Macaque.\n\nThe changes to the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s body became stronger and stronger. Its gold hair that shone like a sun suddenly dimmed, and its gold eyes no longer had their shine.\n\nAnd then there was a weird snapping noise. The Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s substance chains fell apart. In a moment, it went from deified to King class. It still had half-deified power, but it was much worse than it had been before. Previously it had been high in the sky, but now it was on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 how can this be possible?\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s eyes were wide with terror. It couldn\u2019t believe it had become King class.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 what did you do to me? What sort of trick have you used on me again?\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque snarled, then it spun toward Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMonkey, did you know that I have a title here in this universe?\u201d Han Sen asked, smiling at the Six-Eared Macaque.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a wet fart about your title. What trick did you use on me?\u201d The Six-Eared Macaque kept jumping around and shouting, but it didn\u2019t dare to attack Han Sen again.\n\nOne strike had reduced him to a lowly King class being. He never imagined such a thing was possible. He was now quite scared of Han Sen. He didn\u2019t dare to attack Han Sen again.\n\nHan Sen ignored the squealing of the Six-Eared Macaque. He laughed and said, \u201cIn the universe, people call me the Father of God. Do you know why I earned this title?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I\u2026 God\u2019s Father? You are so cocky\u2026\u201d Upon hearing Han Sen\u2019s title, the monkey looked even more annoyed.\n\nThat monkey was deified, but Han Sen seemed to be claiming to have a higher rank. It was clear that the monkey didn\u2019t agree with him.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Six-Eared Macaque, and with a disdainful tone of voice, he said, \u201cThe people in the universe call me God\u2019s Father because deified elites are like children before me. I let them become my sons and daughters, if they are qualified. If I don\u2019t permit a man to become my son, then his best hope is to become my grandchild. Just like you. You aren\u2019t qualified to be my son.\u201d\n\nThe monkey was frozen. He wished to say something, but when he thought of how Han Sen\u2019s strike had reduced him to King class, what Han Sen said seemed to make sense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. You must have used some sort of trick on me\u2026 If you think you have what it takes\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Han Sen hissed coldly, cutting the monkey off. He stared icily at the monkey and said, \u201cI saw that there is talent in you, and I wanted to keep you alive, but you still didn\u2019t appreciate my mercy. Do you really think I won\u2019t kill you? The gods, in my eyes, are a bunch of rubbish. I let them live. They live. If I want them dead, they die. I let them be gods. If I am not happy, the gods are mere toys to me.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen\u2019s body shone with a godly light. He raised his hand, ready to kill the monkey.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque was very scared already. Now, it was super scared by the might of Han Sen. It shivered violently and shouted with fear, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m willing to obey\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019s no need to push yourself.\u201d Han Sen glared at the Six-Eared Macaque. His hands rose, ready to kill the creature.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m not pushing myself. I\u2019m really not pushing myself\u2026 It would be a glorious thing to follow an elite like you! Can you return me to deified class?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t difficult. Come over here.\u201d Han Sen looked like a god as he stared down on the Six-Eared Macaque from above.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque looked hesitant and unwilling to come close to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to kill you, all I would need to do is raise my hand. It wouldn\u2019t be that difficult.\u201d Han Sen looked at the fiend with disdain.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque forced a smile. \u201cNo, no\u2026 I\u2019m not suspicious of your intent\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque ran over to Han Sen. Its body was half the average height of a human\u2019s, and as it stood before Han Sen, it looked like a little kid.\n\nHan Sen looked at it and raised his hand. He touched its head like a godfather and said, \u201cI\u2026 Han Sen\u2026 by the name of all gods\u2026 give you eternal holy power\u2026 open the door of destiny\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen made up a bunch of nonsense that worked well to bluff the Six-Eared Macaque. It had no idea that Han Sen was just wasting time and putting on a show. Han Sen just needed to wait until the effects of the Xuan Yellow Sutra wore off. Then, the Six-Eared Macaque would be deified again. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t even need to use the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He just randomly cast a light on the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s head.\n\nHan Sen calculated the time and slowly spoke his fabricated blessing. By the time he was done, the Xuan Yellow Sutra\u2019s power had disintegrated. The body of the Six-Eared Macaque changed again.\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque saw Han Sen\u2019s power inside its body, and it felt its body change. It quickly became deified again, which filled the creature with joy and relief.\n\nIt was so happy to be deified again. And it was scared of the man before it. He could reduce or raise the monkey\u2019s level on a whim.\n\n\u201cThis guy is too scary. It looks like it might be true that he is some sort of Father of God. He might be King class, but I am inferior to him in every way. I can\u2019t fight him. For a while, at least, I need to stop trying to beat him,\u201d the Six-Eared Macaque tried to comfort itself. It was terrified, and it no longer dared to fight Han Sen.\n\nWhen the Six-Eared Macaque was back to deified class, it immediately kneeled before Han Sen and said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to follow you, now and forever. I hope you let bygones be bygones and are still willing to take me under your wing.\u201d\n\nWhile its mouth spoke, in the Six-Eared Macaque\u2019s heart, it was saying to itself, \u201cLet me find out your true self. Then, I will find a chance to escape this trap and maybe even kill you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen could discern what the Six-Eared Macaque was thinking, but he didn\u2019t confront the beast. He coldly said, \u201cYou should think this through. Once you start following me, there is no chance for regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have thought about it. I will only follow you for the rest of my life, and I will only ever pledge allegiance to you,\u201d the Six-Eared Macaque said dramatically, but his true intent was the opposite.\n\n\u201cGet up and tell me your name.\u201d Han Sen allowed the Six-Eared Macaque to stand up.\n\n\u201cI am the Six-Eared Macaque. I do not have a name,\u201d the creature said.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I will give you a name.\u201d Han Sen fell silent for some time, and then said, \u201cSince you are a monkey deified xenogeneic and a Six-Eared Macaque, I will call you Little Number Six.\u201d\n\nThe Six-Eared Macaque froze when it heard Han Sen\u2019s grand pronouncement. Its heart complained, \u201cThat is a crap name! He was quiet for so long, and he ended up giving me such a childish name.\u201d"
