    "text": "They were unable to find Alang, so Miss Mirror brought Han Sen back to the peak. Fortunately, Han Sen only seemed to have a case of the flu. It wasn\u2019t as big as a deal as it could have been.\n\nBack on the peak, Miss Mirror had someone erect a tent for Han Sen so he could rest.\n\nHan Sen felt incredibly dizzy. He didn\u2019t try to fight through it and stay on his feet, though. He just slept beneath a blanket. It wasn\u2019t as if he could challenge Miss Mirror, even if he wanted to. If the woman sought to bring him harm, he would be unable to fight back.\n\nAnd no one could do anything to Han Sen since Miss Mirror was keeping watch over him. Plus, the blood kirin was happy to guard Han Sen\u2019s tent. Thus, Han Sen was able to sleep soundly.\n\nBecause Han Sen felt so dizzy, it wasn\u2019t long before he slipped into a sound sleep. He didn\u2019t know how long he was asleep, but when he finally woke up, he felt considerably better. His symptoms had vanished.\n\nHe stretched and climbed out of the tent, then immediately froze.\n\nHe had gone to sleep in a tent atop a mountain, but now he climbed out onto a white beach. The tide was lapping against the shore only a few short meters away, the gentle waves breaking across the sand.\n\nHan Sen turned around and realized he was on a small island. He could see every inch of the small island with just one pan of the head.\n\nThat island was no bigger than a baseball pitch, and two palm trees stood close by. The sight made Han Sen frown.\n\nIt was very surprising that someone had been able to teleport Han Sen there, especially under the watchful gaze of Miss Mirror. She was supremely powerful, after all.\n\nAlthough Han Sen didn\u2019t know the full extent of Miss Mirror\u2019s powers, she was King Bai\u2019s right hand. That had to be some sort of proof she was a beast.\n\nThe blood kirin was still standing guard outside the tent, but it seemed strangely calm. If it had been teleported away with him, and it showed no reaction.\n\nWhile Han Sen was thinking, a wave that was a few hundred meters tall suddenly spawned in the sea. It came for the island like a mountain collapsing, and the roar it made sounded like the end of the world.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s stomach dropped, and he quickly used The Story of Genes. Because his body was so packed with Kingese, The Story of Genes was the only geno art he could run smoothly.\n\nBut the wave didn\u2019t break across the island. It stopped in place, hovering right before the landmass. The water gathered up into the face of a giant sea god. It glared down on Han Sen, who was still on the island.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Why did you bring me here?\u201d Han Sen asked the giant sea god thing.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d the sea god growled.\n\nHan Sen did think the face was rather familiar, so he looked closer. He soon noticed that the face that had been composed by that swelling of water was none other than Alang\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAlang?\u201d Han Sen was surprised.\n\n\u201cI am the alpha of water. I am Ancient Water God.\u201d The sea god\u2019s voice sounded like a tsunami. The sky changed color, and a harsh wind blew, making Han Sen\u2019s clothes flap madly. The volume was so loud, Han Sen felt as if his eardrums would rupture.\n\n\u201cYou are Ancient Water God?\u201d Han Sen was frozen. He seemed to remember that he had told Alang he was going to eat the Water God Origin.\n\n\u201cNo wonder Alang\u2019s expression looked so weird when I said that, because\u2026\u201d Han Sen wanted to slap himself. He wished he hadn\u2019t said something so stupid out loud; those were thoughts that he really should have kept to his inner-ramblings. Han Sen knew wallowing in regret would be pointless now, though. He coughed twice to Ancient Water God and said, \u201cMister God, please don\u2019t be mad. I was only kidding around.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were joking?\u201d Ancient Water God made an expression that was almost like a smile, but not quite.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was just a joke.\u201d Han Sen nodded. He kept casting The Story of Genes. He wasn\u2019t arrogant enough to think he could withstand the might of a deified being.\n\nNow, he could only think about running. Luckily, Ancient Water God was on the verge of becoming a god spirit. Han Sen needed to escape back to the sanctuary, wait until the deified died as he tried to level up, then come back after.\n\nThe worst thing was, Han Sen\u2019s body was too full of Kingese to cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He couldn\u2019t use his Blood-Pulse Powers to return to the sanctuary.\n\n\u201cAllow me to continue the joke,\u201d Ancient Water God said. His body shattered and became a heavy storm. It was going to drown the entire island.\n\nThe water poured down around Han Sen, soaking his clothes. He looked like a wet chicken, but he wasn\u2019t injured. The Ancient Water God hadn\u2019t put any power into the water, so it just felt like a particularly intense rainstorm.\n\n\u201cI was just talking. I didn\u2019t actually do anything. You don\u2019t have to be this mad at me,\u201d Han Sen said, feeling frustrated.\n\nBoom!\n\nAncient Water God didn\u2019t appear again, but something exploded through the water not too far away. A silver dragon had emerged from the sea, and its silver light gleamed like the glory of the sun. Silver rain showered from the creature, and its presence was pretty terrifying.\n\nRoar!\n\nThe silver-winged dragon roared into the air, and its silver king area spread to cover everything in sight. Han Sen\u2019s body felt as if it was stuck in the mud, and he could barely move.\n\nThe silver-winged dragon opened its enormous mouth, revealing silver light that looked like a swirling galaxy. It was going to consume Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nThe silver-winged dragon came to consume Han Sen, and he found himself standing right in front of its gaping maw, no larger than one of the dragon\u2019s teeth.\n\nIn the silver-winged dragon\u2019s king area, Han Sen found it hard to move. He wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid the silver-winged dragon\u2019s attack. As The Story of Genes continued to run, he reached out and wrapped both of his hands around one of the dragon\u2019s teeth. It was like two bulls colliding, and he tried to stop the silver-wing dragon.\n\nThe silver-wing dragon\u2019s weight slammed into Han Sen, pushing him down into the sea.\n\nHan Sen held tightly to the dragon tooth as his body was shoved deeper and deeper into the water. He couldn\u2019t stop the beast.\n\nHan Sen ran The Story of Genes as hard as it would go, attempting to shove back the silver-winged power.\n\nAs the dragon plunged through the water, it created a substantial backdraft. If Han Sen let go, he would be pulled into the dragon\u2019s mouth.\n\nThe silver-winged dragon was scary. Han Sen struggled to keep his grip on the dragon tooth, but the water pummeled his body constantly. He trembled under the force, and he felt as if his arms were going to get ripped off by the power.\n\nBoom!\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s body was shining gold. Gold light beamed from every inch of his body, interspersed with tiny symbols.\n\nBecause of the silver-winged dragon\u2019s attack, the Kingese inside of him had activated.\n\nThe gold Kingese cycled furiously through his body, making Han Sen feel as if an endless amount of power was now coursing through his veins. The scariest thing was, it felt like everything in existence was lending him power. Mountain and valley, sun and moon, and every plant in existence were all fueling Han Sen\u2019s strength."
