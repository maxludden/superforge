    "text": "In Narrow Moon\u2019s Full Moon meeting room.\n\nSix Kings had shown up for this meeting. Yisha, Moon Wheel King, Night River King, Flower King, Black Moon King, and Shadow King.\n\n\u201cKnife, do you really believe what he tells you? Despite being only a Baron, he has managed to achieve a mind such as that with Unlimited Sutra? Seriously? Not even Barons who go on to become deified elites are that strong,\u201d Night River King said.\n\nBlack Moon King coughed and said, \u201cNight River, let\u2019s not impose limits that might not exist. This universe is so grand in its reaches that there could be anything out there. Han Sen really is talented. Just because you are unable to achieve such feats of might, don\u2019t presume others cannot either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack Moon, don\u2019t talk such nonsense. Look at this universe! Are there any Barons with that level of capability?\u201d Night River frowned.\n\n\u201cIf everyone was able to do it, why else would we single out the exemplary and call them geniuses?\u201d Black Moon King asked slowly.\n\nNight River King started to respond, but Moon Wheel King cut him off. Moon Wheel King looked at Flower King and Shadow King, and said, \u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d\n\nFlower King groaned and said, \u201cHan Sen\u2019s power seems unlikely, but we can\u2019t claim that there\u2019s a problem without knowing what it is. That hardly seems fair.\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King nodded. He looked at Shadow King, and Shadow King said, \u201cI would rather put an end to this before it gets out of hand.\u201d\n\nYes!\u201d Night River King said immediately. \u201cHan Sen\u2019s history is far too strange, and he cannot be kept.\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King looked at Black Moon King, and Black Moon King said, \u201cKilling a genius like that makes no sense. It will just scare off the other races, and no other race will want to co-operate with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnife, you understand where we\u2019re coming from, yes? He is your student, so it is best that you decide what to do.\u201d Moon Wheel King looked at Yisha.\n\nYisha said calmly, \u201cI gave him a chance. If he passes the test, I can prove that he is fine. If he cannot pass the test, I will sever ties with him and search for any threat he might pose. If I find something, I will get rid of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the test? If he really is a spy from some other race, he will have come prepared. He will pass the test.\u201d Night River King looked displeased.\n\n\u201cOh? You think a Baron spy will be able to create a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months?\u201d Yisha\u2019s face was expressionless.\n\nHearing Yisha say this, the other Kings stared at her with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cGenerate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months? Really?\u201d Moon Wheel King asked, stumbling slightly over the question.\n\n\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d Yisha responded.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with that. If he can accomplish that in three months, then I will believe he is a real genius,\u201d Night River King slowly said, as he sat down.\n\nIt sounded like complete lunacy. It was silly, to think of generating a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months. Across the history of the Rebate, no one had managed anything like that.\n\nNight River King did not believe Han Sen could do it, as Teeth Knife was exclusive to the Rebate. Even among the Rebate, it was rare. The only person who had mastered the skill was Yisha, and you couldn\u2019t cheat your way to learn it.\n\nThe Kings were mollified. If Han Sen could generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months, then practicing Touching Flower Finger with such proficiency would make a lot more sense.\n\n\u201cIf we can confirm Han Sen is legit, and he really is a true genius, should we give him a bit of a reputation? His identity should allow him to become a member of Moon Garden. He did make us proud in this event, after all. If we still don\u2019t let him in, the outsiders in Narrow Moon will become suspicious of us,\u201d Black Moon King said.\n\n\u201cIf he can generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months, I would be willing to make him a teacher in the Moon Garden,\u201d Night River King said grimly.\n\nBlack Moon King smiled at Night River King, then turned his gaze across the table.\n\n\u201cMoon Wheel King, what do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he is legit, and he really is that talented, he should definitely be a member of Moon Garden,\u201d Moon Wheel King said.\n\n\u201cIf everyone has no problem with this, then we shall all reconvene in three months.\u201d Yisha stood up and left the Full Moon meeting room.\n\nLu Xiaomei was walking down the street. The dark circles under her eyes were heavy, and she kept rubbing her head. Ever since Han Bao\u2019er had entered her school, she had begun to feel like she was drowning.\n\nShe was a kindergarten teacher. Before Bao\u2019er, she had dealt with kids crying, not wanting to go to school, and things like that. But now, going to work was like walking into hell itself. If her job hadn\u2019t paid well, she would have quit a long time ago to escape having to deal with the monster that resided there.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore. I am going to die! Today is supposed to be a holiday, and so I should treat myself with a day at the spa. And buy myself a nice gift! Ever since that little witch arrived, I look ten years older.\u201d Lu Xiaomei walked into a high-class female club. She swiped her card as she walked through the door. \u201cI really do need to treat myself better. I can just eat nutrient fluids for the month to make up for what I spend today.\u201d\n\nAfter she entered the place, the attendants served her with passion. She felt as if she had ascended in society, taking the place of royalty.\n\n\u201cThis is my life. Finally, I don\u2019t have to worry about that monster.\u201d Lu Xiaomei wrapped a bathrobe around herself and lay down to wait for her masseuse.\n\n\u201cMiss Lu,\u201d a voice sounded in her ear. It made her muscles freeze. She jumped up and frantically looked around. She didn\u2019t see anyone there, so she felt relieved. She lay back down on the bed and said to herself, \u201cI am starting to hallucinate. Clearly, I am far too stressed out. Maybe I\u2019ll go shopping today, too. That should help.\u201d\n\nAfter lying back down, Lu Xiaomei turned over, and there was a pretty little girl next to her, smiling.\n\n\u201cMiss Lu, what stores are you going to?\u201d\n\nYou\u2026 you\u2026 why are you here!\u201d Lu Xiaomei looked like she had just seen a ghost. She jumped up and pointed at the girl. \u201cI own this club. Did you not know that?\u201d Bao\u2019er shook her head.\n\nLu Xiaomei\u2019s eyes opened wide. \u201cYou own this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I have thirty-one branches of this establishment, all across the city.\u201d Bao\u2019er spoke with innocence.\n\n\u201cThis b*tch is showing off again\u2026\u201d Lu Xiaomei felt both jealous and depressed. She was really hoping Bao\u2019er would disappear right now.\n\nBut an evil expression crossed Bao\u2019er\u2019s face, and she said, \u201cBy the way, I am going to the VIP area for a session. Would you like to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I?\u201d Lu Xiaomei was quite shocked. It was a very expensive place, and she could only come here once a month. For half a month, she would have to eat nutrient fluid just to compensate for how much that place cost. The VIP area was a place you couldn\u2019t easily go to\u2014even if you had a lot of money. She wanted to go, but non-VIPs weren\u2019t allowed.\n\n\u201cOf course, if you want. I can ask the manager to provide you with a VIP card.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled."
