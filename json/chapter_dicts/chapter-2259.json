    "text": "\u201cGeneral Ghost Bone was too devious. He integrated your body into the prison\u2019s structure. If I fully broke down the walls of the palace, I would have to destroy your body as well. Breaking the restrictions would kill you.\u201d Han Sen looked at Fox Queen seriously.\n\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d Fox Queen, hearing Han Sen say this, believed him even more.\n\nIf her powers truly were woven into the palace, then they would have to be very careful as they attempted to escape. A single wrong move could have devastating consequences for her.\n\n\u201cPretty Big Sister, can we talk more\u2026 freely?\u201d Han Sen asked, nodding to the cords that bound him.\n\nFox Queen huffed and released the power binding Han Sen. He was a free man again.\n\nLittle Star was still hanging upside down with wide eyes. It looked like the creature was going to cry.\n\n\u201cUm, if Little Star did something wrong, I will correct him. Please let him go, Pretty Big Sister,\u201d Han Sen quickly said.\n\nFox Queen rolled her eyes at Han Sen, but she still complied and brought Little Star down.\n\nWhen Little Star was free, he ran behind Han Sen and refused to reveal himself. He was obviously scared of Fox Queen.\n\nHan Sen sighed and went on to say, \u201cBreaking out of here without injuring you will be difficult. Even a deified elite might not be able to break the restrictions without bringing you an ounce of harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkip to the chase,\u201d Fox Queen said in annoyance.\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cFortunately, I am good with matters that require such skills. I\u2019m confident that I can take you out of this place safely. But I am just a Duke, and I am weak. The entire process will be rather complicated, and it cannot be done in any short amount of time.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox Queen remained silent, Han Sen coughed and said, \u201cBut if you are willing to cooperate with me, I believe the process can be sped up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you asking me to do?\u201d Fox Queen gazed at Han Sen with absolute mistrust.\n\n\u201cYou are a part of this prison, so you can control a smidgen of it, can\u2019t you? We should start from the section you are able to control. We can use that weakness to pull you away from the core. If we succeed in separating you from the main structure, then even your power will be able to break the restrictions,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Fox Queen said.\n\n\u201cBut there is one thing I need to ask you,\u201d Han Sen added.\n\nFox Queen knew what he wanted, and so she told him directly, \u201cIf you can free me, I will help you get rid of those guys hounding you outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you so much, Sister.\u201d Han Sen looked happy, but he didn\u2019t actually have much confidence in the plan.\n\nHan Sen had asked Fox Queen to continue stretching the loosened section of their prison to stall her. It also allowed Han Sen to understand the palace on a deeper level.\n\nHan Sen gave Fox Queen a steady supply of work to keep her occupied, but taking her out of the prison really wouldn\u2019t be easy. He focused less on the efficacy of the plan, and more on keeping her distracted.\n\nNow that Han Sen was temporarily safe, he thought about how he might escape. He was surrounded by terrifying enemies. If he was a King class elite, perhaps he could fight his way out. But for now, he could only hold on.\n\n\u201cThe stone plate connects with the Sacred Leader\u2019s relic. Perhaps it will come in useful when I seek to rescue Littleflower. I can\u2019t let Edward get his hands on it.\u201d Han Sen made his mind up, deciding to go after the Sacred Leader\u2019s relic no matter what it took.\n\nBut right now, he couldn\u2019t get out. And he had no idea where the monument was supposed to be. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to claim the Sacred Leader\u2019s relic, that was for sure.\n\n\u201cPretty Big Sister, why did Ghost Bone erect this palace here? Is there a reason why this place was chosen?\u201d Han Sen was hoping to glean some information about where the holy monument might lay.\n\nFox Queen was General Ghost Bone\u2019s wife, so there was a chance she knew a thing or two.\n\nFox Queen shrugged. \u201cI know he made a big mistake, and Sacred Leader sent him here to explore. I don\u2019t know anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means you think there was some contention between them?\u201d Han Sen could hear Fox Queen\u2019s concern behind her words.\n\nFox Queen had been locked away for so long, and her boredom had grown to immense proportions. She seemed to like having someone to talk to, so she went on to say, \u201cGeneral Ghost Bone looked murderous, but he was incredibly loyal to Sacred Leader. He was practically his right-hand man. How could he make a mistake that would force him to come to this sort of place? Something else must have been happening behind the scenes, but General Ghost Bone was a quiet man. He never really told me what he was doing here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t tell if Fox Queen really was clueless or if she was just pretending to be. He thought for a moment, then said, \u201cI found a place called Ghost Bone Town out in a desert. Is that where he lived?\u201d\n\nFox Queen frowned. \u201cAfter General Ghost Bone came to live here, he didn\u2019t build homes anywhere else. Why would there be a Ghost Bone Town? Tell me what the place looked like.\u201d\n\nHan Sen told her about the town he had discovered, but he didn\u2019t say anything about how it was in disarray.\n\nWhen Fox Queen heard Han Sen\u2019s description, the expression on her face morphed through a variety of emotions. After a while, she said, \u201cI see\u2026 I see\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nFox Queen smiled. \u201cIf I am guessing things correctly, the town you found was actually a haven for the Sacred Leader. Ghost Bone Town was just an outpost. No wonder he was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that place?\u201d Han Sen was so happy. He was finally getting to the meat of these mysteries.\n\nFox Queen considered his question. \u201cYou told me that Sacred was destroyed a long time ago, so talking about it shouldn\u2019t matter anymore. If the Sacred Leader was still around, I would not dare speak.\u201d\n\nAfter a lengthy pause, she went on to say, \u201cThe Sacred Leader led the Sacred. He beat every being that came against him, and he almost became the king of the entire geno universe. But every creature has a lifespan, and that law even applied to someone as powerful as the Sacred Leader. No one is able to fight time, and death finds us all one day. That powerful man didn\u2019t want to die like everyone else, though. And so, he sought to live forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the pursuit of immortality, Sacred Leader conducted many tests. I know there were at least a hundred of them.\u201d Fox Queen seemed to be struggling to remember. \u201cI was Ghost Bone\u2019s wife, and Ghost Bone was the Sacred Leader\u2019s most trusted right hand. I learned a bit about all this from Ghost Bone, and although I was told little, I could tell that the leader was ambitious. He sent people to the disaster on Planet Yuanli, the strange thing in Buried Dragon Valley, the holy spirits in the sanctuaries, and the demi-god\u2019s space. They were searching for the key to immortality all because of Sacred Leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holy spirits in the sanctuaries? What are those?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart almost leaped out of his chest, but he forced himself to look merely curious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much of the details, as it\u2019s only something I heard Ghost Bone say. In Sacred, there is a strange xenogeneic space they called the sanctuaries. The leader tried to research the undying spirits there,\u201d Fox Queen said after some thought.\n\n\u201cSpirits?\u201d Han Sen thought, his heart trembling."
