    "text": "A moment later, Han Sen knew exactly what Gia\u2019s power was. He did not hesitate, and he suddenly accelerated when her steel spear approached.\n\nThe steel spear and the horn power it carried were unable to catch up with him. Han Sen flashed past Gia, laying a slash across her neck with his knife. The strike wasn\u2019t enough to completely behead her, but blood vessels and windpipe were severed.\n\nGia couldn\u2019t speak, but she was still active. She swung her steel spear at Han Sen again. Han Sen sped up and dodged the incoming spear once more. Again, he plunged his knife into Gia\u2019s back.\n\nGuna was standing in the cave, and she watched Han Sen\u2019s brutal attacks with an expression of shock.\n\n\u201cThe Rebate\u2019s Teeth power? How? He is not even one of the Rebate! How has he managed to use it?\u201d Guna dropped into thought. \u201cIf he really is the buyer, an escape might be pretty difficult. At that speed, he\u2019s faster than a Marquise. His power doesn\u2019t seem to match that level of speed, though.\u201d\n\nAs Guna pondered all this, Gia dropped her steel spear to the ground and fell over.\n\nHer wounds were bleeding profusely, particularly the injuries on her neck. Her neck had been halfway severed, and it had swiftly drained her. She hadn\u2019t been able to stay strong.\n\nHer windpipe had been sliced in two, so she couldn\u2019t even scream. All she could do was twitch on the ground.\n\nHan Sen then shoved his knife into her heart with ease, due to her inability to resist. He ended her life just like that. \u201cThank you for saving me. The Gana will repay this debt with generosity.\u201d Guna bowed before Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAnd what sort of reward should I expect from you guys?\u201d Han Sen asked, glancing over Guna.\n\nThis was his chance. He wanted to use his powers to impress the Gana so that they might consider joining him. He had previously thought an opportunity like this would be impossible to come by.\n\nBut now, a chance had miraculously shown up right in front of him. He wasn\u2019t going to let this chance pass him by. If he played his cards right, he wagered he could take her to Planet Eclipse.\n\nGuna looked at Han Sen and thought things might be going from bad to worse. She looked at his face and believed she had met someone who wasn\u2019t a good man.\n\nGuna smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s more of the Kao on Planet Crooked Rock, and the Gana are going to be practically helpless soon. If you do not mind, I would like to bring my family along with you someplace. We can follow you, and we can help you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised, and he observed her facade of sincere gratitude. It made him laugh.\n\n\u201cCan you take us with you, please?\u201d Guna looked serious.\n\n\u201cI can take you. But only you. Forget about your family. We are poor, so we cannot take care of too many people.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nGuna looked very sincere, despite her obvious anxiety. \u201cDo not worry! We have a lot of savings, and we can give it all to you. Just promise you can take us somewhere nice.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not bother talking with Guna anymore. He had seen many evil people in the past, and there were far more out there with worse intentions than Guna. He could tell what sort of person she truly was.\n\nHan Sen moved up to her, then brought out something to tape her mouth shut.\n\nGuna\u2019s face changed when she saw this, and she hurriedly tried to say, \u201cI have a way for you to find many Gana that would be willing to obey you. Just let me go!\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t stop, and the tape was drawing close to her mouth. She went on to say, \u201cI am the leader\u2019s daughter. You will encounter much trouble if you take me with you. And on top of all that, I don\u2019t know how to produce medicine. You will have no use for me, take my word for that. If you provide me the chance, I can get five pharmacists for you to take with you safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me more.\u201d Han Sen was interested enough to hear more, and he was rather surprised he had met and saved the leader\u2019s daughter by mere happenstance.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Guna said. \u201cYou are my savior! If you take me back, my father is sure to provide you with the services of five pharmacists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one more chance.\u201d Han Sen looked at Guna coldly.\n\nGuna bit at her lips and said, \u201cYou can take a video of me, and blackmail my father into procuring the services. Just ask for the help of a few, and he is sure to agree.\u201d\n\nHan Sen went ahead and covered her mouth. He picked her up and left the cave, even as she struggled.\n\nHan Sen wouldn\u2019t blackmail a leader of the Gana.\n\nThe Gana were considered kings of the planet, and so it would be quite easy for them to track Han Sen down. And if the Gana did find him, many elites of other races would do their best to save Guna, all in the hopes of earning more of the Gana\u2019s trust.\n\nThe elites would undoubtedly find themselves summoned like Jade Gold King had been.\n\nHan Sen just wanted to take her back to Planet Eclipse. There was nothing she or her family could do once she was\n\nthere. The Gana was merely a small race of no renown, and the strongest amongst them was just a single King. They wouldn\u2019t dare venture to Narrow Moon.\n\nEven if their King went there, it was unlikely he\u2019d come back. The Rebate also required pharmacists like the Gana. It was cruel, yes, but it was also the truth. The Gana were known for their abilities, not their strength.\n\nBefore Han Sen exited the cave, he saw Dragon Lady, Meng\u2019er, and Wang Yuhang all walking out.\n\n\u201cDid you guys evolve a second time?\u201d Han Sen asked Dragon Lady and Meng\u2019er. They nodded, and it brought Han Sen some relief. He said, \u201cMeng\u2019er, follow me. Dragon Lady and Uncle can walk together. My ship is to the south, so Dragon Lady can just go and register. I will also invite Uncle.\u201d\n\nAfter their discussion, Dragon Lady and Wang Yuhang left first. Guna looked upset, and Han Sen thought about how he might sneak her back to the ship.\n\nThe factions were spying on one another. If he brought one of the Gana back to the ship, he would look very suspicious.\n\nBut as Han Sen was thinking, Little Invisible showed up. It jumped on Guna\u2019s head and then disappeared again. Strangely, Guna disappeared too. She became completely see-through like the creature, and it didn\u2019t at all look as if she was standing where she was.\n\n\u201cGood job, Little Invisible.\u201d Han Sen was happy, and he hadn\u2019t expected the little creature to have that sort of power."
