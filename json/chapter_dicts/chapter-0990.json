This prompted him to follow, despite the sirens in his head. When he caught up with her, she had crawled even further forward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go in there!\u201d Moment Queen shouted. If Han Sen died, she did, too. There was nothing for her to gain in her master\u2019s untimely death.\n\nHan Sen returned Moment Queen to the Sea of Soul and continued chasing after Bao\u2019er.\n\nHe would have put his foot down and stopped her if Bao\u2019er was an ordinary baby. But her appearance obviously hid her true maturity and knowledge. She wouldn\u2019t have crawled into the castle like she was, if there was nothing of value to be found there.\n\nWhen they got inside, there were a variety of different passages. The variety of passages didn\u2019t slow Bao\u2019er down, though. As if she knew the way to go, she kept on crawling without a single pause to collect her bearings.\n\nShe crawled incredibly quickly, and whenever Han Sen fell behind, she\u2019d stop and turn around. Then, she\u2019d call out, \u201cDaddy, come!\u201d\n\nHan Sen continued to follow her, and was surprised by the distinct lack of action. They walked through the labyrinthine complex of the vine-castle without anything attempting to get in their way.\n\nThe castle was massive, and Han Sen had been walking for at least ten miles within its walls. He projected there\u2019d be many more directions to travel since paths branched off in every-which-way, as awkwardly and obtusely as the very vines that twirled around each other to form the castle\u2019s structure.\n\nSuddenly, Bao\u2019er stopped. She pointed forward, and at which point, Han Sen decided to pick her up. In front of them, the corpse of a dead creature barred their way.\n\nIt was a golden tiger of sorts, and its body was wedged into the passage, with its backside facing them. There were no visible wounds, but blood coated the area around it.\n\n\u201cHm, did the roar come from this thing?\u201d Han Sen summoned his Disloyal Knight.\n\nWhen Disloyal Knight saw the body, it emotionlessly approached the corpse and began chomping on the flesh and slurping its blood.\n\nIf Disloyal Knight was so interested in eating the creature, then there was a high chance the fallen monster was a super creature.\n\nDisloyal Knight ate as quickly as Little Angel had, and it wasn\u2019t long before Han Sen could see the front of the tiger.\n\nThe tiger did not have a head, and he was unsure why it was missing or who had severed it.\n\nAfter a brief look around, he couldn\u2019t find the head and neither could he find a Life Geno Essence to consume.\n\nDisloyal Knight was almost done with the creature. With most of the flesh gone, it began gnawing at the bones, before snapping them and sucking the marrow inside with a revolting, feverish excitement. Han Sen had no clue how it could eat so much.\n\nWhen it was done, Han Sen put Disloyal Knight away. Then, Bao\u2019er crawled forward and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Daddy.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was unsure whether or not he should keep going, as the way that monster had been killed concerned him a great deal.\n\nBut with Bao\u2019er hurrying him, not dismayed by what they had just seen, he was okay with following her forward.\n\nWhenever the way branched\u2014which was often\u2014Bao\u2019er led him without pause. There was no fear of getting lost, with her leading the way.\n\nShortly after, they came to a big room. In its center, there was an alter that had also been formed by the vines of the castle. Upon it lay a man.\n\nDragon-like horns protruded from the man\u2019s head, and his body was clad in black-plated armor. He had long, blue hair. As surreal as the scene was, it was so quiet, you would assume the man was just peacefully in slumber.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Han Sen noticed a glowing orb atop the man\u2019s magnificently still forehead. It was beautiful.\n\nLooking inside it, the image of a dragon appeared. It seemed to swim around inside the orb, as if the glowing lights were the sea it resided in.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the spirit orb?\u201d Han Sen was overjoyed at the discovery, but he wasn\u2019t willing to be so reckless as to attempt to steal it without learning more about the situation he had found himself in.\n\nThe man did not look dead, and his sleep may have been true. If Han Sen snatched the orb, and the man woke up, he\u2019d be the one who was dead.\n\nDeciding it was time to bring Moment Queen back, he did just that.\n\nShe looked angry and ready to complain at first, but when her eyes glanced across the man, she screamed and said, \u201cSpirit orb! It\u2019s Dragon King\u2019s spirit orb!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we take it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen inspected it carefully, but came to a disappointing conclusion. \u201cNo. The emperor has not been revived, but the body is active. It looks as if it\u2019s missing a key ingredient that is necessary to complete the resurrection ritual.\u201d\n\nMoment Queen paused, and then went on to say, \u201cDragon King\u2019s body is connected to the orb. The lifeforce inside the orb, if stolen, might compel the body to attack and kill us. And that would be no hassle for an emperor, believe me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, does that mean we should leave it be? We can\u2019t take it?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nMoment Queen had a wry smile, but then said, \u201cHis resurrection is only half complete. I still fail to understand how it wasn\u2019t a success. See the dragon inside the orb? That is the spirit\u2019s soul. He should have been revived, so it is very strange to learn that he has not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe spirit orbs you can take and consume are those that have yet to achieve any such activity. This is far too tricky for us to attempt.\u201d Moment Queen seemed to be out of ideas.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but Bao\u2019er suddenly held up her gourd. Then she aimed it at the dragon orb.\n\nOver the course of a single second, the orb was sucked into the gourd.\n\nMoment Queen froze, looking at Bao\u2019er as if she had just seen a ghost.\n\nHan Sen, seeing Bao\u2019er take the orb, then turned his attention to the body, in case it moved. But then, the strangest thing occurred: the lifeless body withered away, drying up like a long-deceased carcass.\n\nDong!\n\nSomething fell from the emperor\u2019s body, after it dried up."
