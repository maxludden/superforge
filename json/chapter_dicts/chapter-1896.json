It\u2019s possible that this spring could make your Spell geno armament level up. It could become a Viscount.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means the Red Mist Spring can level things up?\u201d Han Sen was happy to hear this.\n\nHis Spell geno armament had been difficult to develop. It required an external sort of power for that to occur. If he tried to level it through solo practice, it\u2019d be a slow process. It\u2019d probably take him a hundred years to get it up to Viscount class through training alone.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t about Han Sen performing poorly, though. It was because The Story of Genes was not for humans. It was extremely unlikely that Han Sen had been able to practice it in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be better if it was simply a treasure,\u201d Yisha sighed and said. \u201cThere is only one way to generate a Red Mist Spring. It has only been created because many creatures have died in this area and remained buried here for billions of years. Changes have occurred beneath the ground, which resulted in the generation of this new substance. The red mist is a sign that the substance has finished formulating, and that it is now available.\u201d\n\nHan Sen waited for a bit, hoping she\u2019d continue speaking.\n\n\u201cThis is a substance that comes from the corpses of xenogeneics. Nobles have no use for it, but it is great for ordinary types. Average creatures who touch it can become xenogeneic. If a xenogeneic ate this substance, they\u2019d evolve quickly.\u201d Yisha went on to say, \u201cBut your geno armament is special, and I think there is a way in which Spell can absorb it. We can speed up your growth by doing this. If there is enough of the substance, we can level her up to Viscount.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Han Sen asked. It was too difficult to level up Spell, and if there was a chance to cut comers here, he didn\u2019t want to let it escape him.\n\n\u201cI have a geno art I believe you should practice. When the Red Mist Spring comes out, you use that skill and transfer the power obtained into Spell. If you do that, she will level up. But this geno art is very difficult to learn, and transferring the spring\u2019s power will be painful. It\u2019s entirely up to you if this is what you want,\u201d Yisha said. She would provide him as much information as she could, but the decision was ultimately up to him.\n\n\u201cThanks, Queen.\u201d Han Sen accepted the papers she offered him and looked over the geno art that was called Yin Yang Change.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to go to the event I told you about,\u201d Yisha told Han Sen before she left.\n\nHan Sen confirmed he\u2019d go, despite his total lack of enthusiasm in it. He began practicing Yin Yang Change right away, though.\n\nHan Sen gave it a read-through, and he was immediately taken by surprise. Yin Yang Change was just like Yin Yang Blast. It had simply been developed in a different direction.\n\nYin Yang Blast\u2019s focus was on exchanging power that came against it, in which a power\u2019s direction would be reversed. Yin Yang Change was based on making a power stronger.\n\nWith Yin Yang Blast as a base, he could easily learn how to take advantage of Yin Yang Change. He would only need a bit of practice before using it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how Yisha had dealt with Black Cliff. She didn\u2019t mention anything about the man, so he didn\u2019t ask.\n\nBut Yisha hadn\u2019t killed Black Cliff, he knew that. He thought she might have simply sent him back to Black-Moon King.\n\nYisha thought the Red Mist Spring would make itself apparent in around forty days. So, Han Sen had plenty of time to practice.\n\nWang Yuhang went to Han Sen\u2019s room, smiling. \u201cHan Sen, there is a Rebate woman looking for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebate woman? I don\u2019t know any Rebate women.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cStill pretending? She says you are her teacher, and you two used to be close. You even taught her knife skills.\u201d Wang Yuhang was still smiling.\n\n\u201cNo, I never taught any Rebate women. There is a Rebate woman that teaches me, however.\u201d Han Sen was depressed, unable to think who he might have been talking about.\n\n\u201cWhat Rebate woman has been\u2026 teaching you?\u201d Wang Yuhang looked at him with a disgustingly creepy face.\n\n\u201cKnife Queen. Who else?\u201d Han Sen said, then left. He didn\u2019t know who Wang Yuhang was talking about, so he went to take a look.\n\nHe went to a meeting room, and there he found a fifteen-year-old Rebate woman. She had white rabbit ears and a face that was quite chubby. She had big eyes, and she was really cute. Seeing her there, it was tempting to reach out and squeeze her cheeks.\n\nLooking at the Rebate girl made Han Sen think of Wang Mengmeng. They were not of the same race, but they sure looked similar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I know you,\u201d Han Sen said, while looking at the lady.\n\n\u201cMaster, please allow me to follow and obey you.\u201d The girl immediately kneeled in front of Han Sen and bowed via the Rebate\u2019s typical gesture.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Who are you?\u201d Han Sen looked at the lady.\n\n\u201cMy name is Qing Li. I am Flower King\u2019s daughter. I really admire Knife Queen, and I wanted to become her student. She, however, did not accept me. So, I will have to ask you to become my teacher, in her stead. That way, I can sort of be Queen\u2019s student!\u201d Qing Li looked rather smug.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made plans to accept any students,\u201d Han Sen said. He was so busy these days that he really didn\u2019t have the time to accept students.\n\nQing Li was Flower King\u2019s daughter. Flower King was at the same level as Yisha. If Qing Li became Han Sen\u2019s student, it would suggest that Flower King was of lower stature than Yisha. If Han Sen actually accepted her, it was highly unlikely that Flower King would agree to it.\n\n\u201cIt is too late. I am already following you. From now on, you are my teacher. Queen will become my elder teacher.\u201d Qing Li looked quite excited.\n\n\u201cYou are Qing Li, right?\u201d Han Sen was not mad, and he actually smiled at her.\n\n\u201cYes. And you are my teacher, right? You can call me Little Li.\u201d Qing Li sounded rather sweet.\n\n\u201cQing Li, I\u2019m not refusing to be your teacher, but if you want to be my student, you are going to have to pass my tests first. Forcing me to become your teacher is useless,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of tests do you want me to perform?\u201d Qing Li asked.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to follow Queen so much?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt is because Queen is great and her knife skills are the best. She practices the strongest Teeth Knife of the Rebate. I really want to be like her, so that is why I want to obey her,\u201d Qing Li said in explanation.\n\n\u201cSo, you simply want to learn Teeth Knife?\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cI guess. But I want to learn it straight from Queen. I don\u2019t care if others teach me,\u201d Qing Li said seriously.\n\n\u201cHow about we do a test, and see if you possess the adequate talent to learn it? If you do, I can accept you as my student. Then, you will become Queen\u2019s student\u2019s student,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cReally? Then test me! How do we do the test?\u201d Qing Li sounded excited.\n\n\u201cI will write a few words for you, and then you can go practice them. If you can write them down exactly the same, I will take you as my student.\u201d Han Sen said that, and then brought out a wooden board. He used his fingers to write down a few words, and then gave her the board."
