    "text": "He held the causal karma knife. Han Sen\u2019s body boiled with weird power. He slashed downward, but he was not aiming at the stone tablet. He slashed the air.\n\nThe knife light gathered in the air. It was like it was frozen. Han Sen\u2019s knife light went faster, one light after another. It made the central knife light steadily grow brighter.\n\nEveryone knew what he was trying to do. In the fight to light up the lantern, everyone in the universe witnessed his Under the Sky Knife skill. They knew that Han Sen only required enough time to generate enough knife lights to cast a powerful, top-class true god power.\n\nBai Wushang frowned. He wanted to see Han Sen\u2019s hitting-god skill. He did not want to waste time watching a trick that required time to perform. A real, top-class true god class would not allow Han Sen this much time to gather up so many knife lights and knife airs.\n\nDealing with the stone tablet, which was a weird xenogeneic, Han Sen\u2019s gathering of power skill was the most useful.\n\nOther people had geno arts that enabled them to build up power too, but they were not long-lasting. They eventually faded away. It was also hard to control 10,000 powers.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Under the Sky Knife skills left the powers there. They would not fade away, and there were no flaws in the controls. Even with a billion knife lights generated, he could control them well.\n\nOf course, even if a normal true god could control that many knife lights, they could not cast out that many knife lights without using any power. Han Sen secretly used his Dongxuan Aura. He forced the energy in the universe to help him with the Under the Sky Knife skill adhering to the rules of the universe. That was how he kept on building up knife lights.\n\nIn a real deathmatch fight, it was very rare to see a few 1,000 or a few 100,000 knife lights used. Now, Han Sen kept quickly slashing. There were more and more knife lights. They did not plan on stopping. The knife lights were already uncountable. They were like a galaxy spinning in space that created a scary knife stream.\n\nThe primitive deifieds were shocked as they watched. They fell back a few thousand miles.\n\nIf there were only one or two of Han Sen\u2019s knife lights, or even 10 to 20, his power would not be as good as Bai Wushang\u2019s punch. Now, the power was like a river. The power was far scarier than Bai Wushang\u2019s punch.\n\nBai Wushang frowned. There were so many knife lights. Even if he did not have the confidence to control them, it was impressive for Han Sen to be able to control the knife lights however he wanted to. Also, nothing was fading away. That was quite powerful. It was not something achieved through luck.\n\nHan Sen kept casting knife lights. Clearly, his control power had not reached the max yet. He had just accomplished something that many top-class true god couldn\u2019t do.\n\nOnly true god elites, such as Sky Palace Leader and Very High Leader, who knew about such geno arts, could do it.\n\nHan Sen did not know how many knife lights he had summoned. Knife lights were covering the sky and covering the ground. They seemed to be covering everything around.\n\n\u201cThat should be enough.\u201d Han Sen felt as if he was almost at the breaking point. If he kept going, he thought he might not be able to control the many knife streams.\n\nHan Sen looked at the stone tablet. He did not hesitate. He held the causal karma knife above his head. The sky was full of knife streams. It was like a vortex gathering atop the causal karma knife. The knife lights on the knife were growing stronger.\n\nAlthough the stream of knives was powerful, the stone tablet seemed to have an impressive recovery power. If he continued to attack like he was, he might not be able to destroy it.\n\nHan Sen planned to use all the knife lights together and generate an extremely powerful knife light. He wanted to slash and break the stone tablet.\n\nEven if he could not destroy the stone tablet, he could slash a big piece of it. Whatever he was to receive would be greater than Bai Wushang\u2019s stone element bird Gold Wing Big God Bird.\n\nAs the knife lights grew stronger, the primitive deifieds were becoming increasingly frightened. Their foreheads developed a cold sweat. They could not help but retreat even further.\n\nEven Bai Wushang was a bit impressed by seeing so many knife lights.\n\nHis full power attacks were inferior to this powerful knife light.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is dependent on skill, to be able to use knife lights, Han Sen must have quite a scary power. This son must go. In the future, he could be a big threat to the Extreme King.\u201d Bai Wushang was even more scared of Han Sen now.\n\nFrom what Bai Wushang had seen, the stronger Han Sen was, the more of a threat to the Extreme King he was. It was better to get rid of him sooner rather than later. If he became a true god and challenged the Extreme King, there would be a lot of ruins in his wake.\n\nHan Sen was holding the knife and shaking. He had gathered up too many knife lights. He felt as if he could not control it. If it was not for the fact that the causal karma knife could not be destroyed, he was afraid the entire knife would shatter with the weight of so many knife lights atop it.\n\nThe knife light was sharp. It also seemed like it was about to fly to the sky. Some knife lights still did not go on it. Han Sen did not care about them anymore. He waved his big knife and madly slashed at the stone tablet.\n\nThe knife light, which looked like it could rip up ground, came down. It struck the top of the stone tablet, cutting it open. Between the knife lights, the stone tablet was cut open inch by inch.\n\nCountless knife lights shattered it, sending stone dust everywhere. Rainbow light burst out of the stone tablet that. The primitive deifieds standing far away were frozen. It was like the whole universe itself had been cut open.\n\nBoom! Boom!\n\nThe whole stone tablet was cut in half. It fell completely apart. The knife lights on Han Sen\u2019s causal karma knife were almost depleted. Some knife airs were burning. It was like a fire that had not been put out.\n\nDust was everywhere. Everyone was shocked.\n\nBai Wushang was only able to leave a punch mark on the stone tablet. Han Sen cut them in half. How scary was that power?\n\nAlthough the time for preparation had taken a while, which was useless in combat, witnessing such power was scary all the same.\n\nBai Wushang and the others stared at the stone tablet that had been cut in half. They wanted to know what was going to happen next.\n\nThe stone tablet spawned a stone bird when a mark was left on it. Now, the whole stone tablet had been cut open. Therefore, it was hard to tell what was going to happen.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He watched as the rainbow-looking stone tablet fell to the floor, but he did not speak.\n\nHe did not hear a notification for slaying a xenogeneic, which meant the stone tablet had not been killed. It was still alive.\n\nHe had such a scary knife, yet he was still unable to kill the stone tablet. The stone table was likely a top-class true god xenogeneic. It was a shame it did not attack and could only receive hits.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe rainbow light coming out of the two sections of the tablet grew stronger. They turned into a scary rainbow flame that burst into the sky. The whole sky transformed into a rainbow."
