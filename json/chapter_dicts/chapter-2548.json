    "text": "The armored man vanished from Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon\u2019s vision. Then, he reappeared in front of Han Sen. His striking fist approached Han Sen\u2019s belly. Just as the armored man\u2019s fist was about to hit Han Sen, Han Sen\u2019s body suddenly disappeared. He reappeared elsewhere. His fast escape was a product of the teleportation abilities he had been practicing.\n\nWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, the armored man threw another punch. And with it, his body vanished just like last time. He appeared in front of Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body blinked away again to avoid the incoming fist of the armored man.\n\nThe two of them kept flashing across the expanse of space, moving too fast for ordinary eyesight to follow. It was like they could be in the sky at one point and on the ground in the next.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon moved to help Han Sen, but he told them, \u201cStay back\u2026 you guys cannot evade his attacks. Use your power to protect yourselves, and don\u2019t leave any of your weaknesses exposed.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing him, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon stopped in their tracks. They watched Han Sen and the man in black armor do battle. Elysian Moon opened the paper umbrella in her hands. A swordlight flashed from the surface of the umbrella, then expanded to envelop the two of them. Just as Han Sen wanted, it left no weaknesses exposed.\n\n\u201cThat man in armor isn\u2019t using teleportation abilities,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said with certainty, as she observed the battlefield ahead of her.\n\nElysian Moon nodded seriously. \u201cIt isn\u2019t teleportation. It\u2019s more like\u2026 It\u2019s more like\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGodslayer Luo.\u201d Gu Qingcheng finished what Elysian Moon was hesitant to say.\n\nThat old man was a lone warrior who had once obtained a foothold in the sanctuaries for humanity.\n\nWhen his power reached the max, the presence he gave off was just like the one they felt from the armored man. He ignored the rules of space to kill his enemies.\n\n\u201cWhy does the armored man have Falsified Sky powers? No, wait\u2026 that is Sky Demon power. The armored man is a Demon?\u201d Gu Qingcheng wondered aloud.\n\nHan Sen knew the armored man was using Sky Demon powers. He clearly wasn\u2019t using a space-based teleportation talent. Not many powers could repel Sky Demon powers, but thankfully, Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra was one of the few that could.\n\nThe armored man\u2019s absolute strikes weren\u2019t difficult for Han Sen to break, but the armored man\u2019s power was undeniably greater than Han Sen\u2019s. And that meant Han Sen couldn\u2019t defeat him.\n\nHan Sen felt a mixture of different emotions when he looked at the armored man. He knew this attacker was different from the Demons they had encountered earlier, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what the difference was.\n\nJi Yang Sheng and a few of the Demon elites watched the fight through a mirror. They appeared to be in shock. Even Ji Yang Sheng was floored by what he was witnessing.\n\n\u201cHe is a very powerful guy. He has dodged every attack that the Demon Doll has thrown.\u201d Ji Yang Sheng chewed his lip. That was what he did when he was in thought.\n\n\u201cNo wonder Han Sen escaped harm when he was pursued by the Extreme King. He is very scary. He is dodging the attacks of the Sky Demon powers somehow. I wonder what power he has been making use of,\u201d a few Demon elites said, their voices a mixture of admiration and trepidation.\n\nThey knew that the Demon Doll\u2019s Sky Demon power ensured that every hit was a successful one unless the enemy possessed the same causal powers. If the enemy didn\u2019t, not even teleportation would let them escape the Demon Doll\u2019s strikes.\n\nSky Demon abilities were a causal power. Once the Demon Doll locked onto Han Sen, even if Han Sen teleported away, he should still be hit.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s teleportation let him dodge the Demon Doll\u2019s attacks, though. He was obviously using an advanced version of teleportation. And as for what other powers Han Sen was employing, Ji Yang Sheng couldn\u2019t guess. He couldn\u2019t understand what he was witnessing.\n\n\u201cHe might be dodging the Demon Doll\u2019s strikes for now, but his efforts are futile. He is slower and weaker than the Demon Doll. We must take him with us today. Our race requires more than just a blessing. Thousands of our people over the next few decades\u2026 No, millions of our people over the next few centuries will need what he can provide us,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng declared. In an effort to speed things up, he put more of his power into the purple horn. The purple horn\u2019s mysterious symbols glowed with a purple light.\n\nThe powers of blessing Han Sen had displayed made other races take him very seriously. They needed his abilities.\n\nIf they could capture Han Sen, they wouldn\u2019t hand him over to the Extreme King. They would lock him up for themselves and force him to bless their children and grandchildren.\n\nThe mysterious symbols on the purple horn lit up further. And then, the armored man who had been struggling to capture Han Sen suddenly stopped. His body suddenly enlarged.\n\nThe muscles of the mystery man grew, and the black armor began to swell. It had to morph in order to fit the bulging muscles. It highlighted their ridiculous size all too well.\n\nA dark purple presence intensified within that armor. It made the armored man look like a demon from hell. His eyes were purple like lightning.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 this is Shura Change.\u201d Han Sen looked at the armored man in shock. He whispered the words hoarsely.\n\nHe finally knew why the armored man\u2019s presence felt different from the other Demons. They looked so similar, but Han Sen could feel that this guy was more like a shura from the Alliance\u2019s universe. His power, however, was obviously some variant of Sky Demon power. That was what made him look just like one of the Demon. It was very difficult to tell the difference, and so Han Sen hadn\u2019t caught on until now.\n\nOnce he used Shura Change, the shura\u2019s presence became heavier. Now, Han Sen was finally getting a better sense of what was happening.\n\n\u201cWhy is there a shura here? I never brought a shura to the geno universe. Unless he is one of the shuras that come out of the coffin in the Shura\u2019s Graveyard\u2026 He\u2026 Could he be one of the shura kings?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Demon-like armored man with a conflicted expression. And as he did, Han Sen kept thinking.\n\nThe armored man didn\u2019t stop to think through things like Han Sen had. After he finished changing, his purple lightning-like eyes peered at Han Sen. Then, the muscular creature threw a punch toward Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen dodged the attack of the armored man, but when he teleported away, the armored man appeared in front of him. Purple flames burst to life around the man\u2019s fist as it slammed into Han Sen\u2019s stomach.\n\nPang!\n\nWhen that fist connected, Han Sen\u2019s body shot away like a raging fireball. He flew into a nearby asteroid. He went through it and many more, cleaving a line through space.\n\nBefore Han Sen could stop, the armored man appeared in front of him and punched him again. Once more, he was sent flying.\n\nBlergh!\n\nHan Sen spat out some blood. He kept falling, and he couldn\u2019t even teleport away."
