    "text": "Han Sen stood on the lotus mountain, watching with great delight as the blood kirin entered the fray. Han Sen guessed that the creature had finished consuming the black kirin, because it was now half-deified. On top of that, it was still inside the White Bone Hell. The ferocity of its attack sent Edward and Ice Blue Knight King reeling back.\n\nAfter mere seconds had passed, the blood kirin had already torn two King class Ice Blue Knights to shreds. Joy sparked in Han Sen\u2019s chest as he saw the wretchedly wild face of the creature.\n\n\u201cYou guys hold off this beast! I will go after Han Sen,\u201d Edward shouted. He rushed across the battlefield, headed for the lotus mountain with the intent of catching Han Sen once and for all.\n\nThe blood kirin was in a killing frenzy, and it paid no attention to guarding its flanks. It pressed the attack against Ice Blue Knight King without sparing a glance at Edward.\n\nHan Sen felt depressed. \u201cThis thing\u2019s intelligence needs to be increased.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fox Queen had whipped Edward and injured him badly in the process, his half-deified body wasn\u2019t to be underestimated. He circled the battle and arrived in front of Han Sen in moments. Han Sen knew that trying to outrun the man with simple speed would be impossible.\n\nHan Sen slapped the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum at his waist, sending a burst of scary sonic power toward Edward\u2019s forehead. The power flew out like a barrage of toxic needles.\n\nEdward grunted dismissively, and his whole body turned to a golden color. The Blood Scorpion\u2019s toxic needles struck the gold body and failed to puncture it.\n\nEdward\u2019s golden form shone like a sun, showering the entire lotus mountain in golden light. Han Sen suddenly felt incredibly heavy, as if he was now shouldering the weight of a mountain. He couldn\u2019t move much at all.\n\nHan Sen knew that he was struggling under the power of that special gold godlight.\n\nAfter Dukes became Kings, their elemental prowess increased dramatically. They could use their powers to blanket the land around them, laying claim to a large area. Edward\u2019s power was a heavy burden of suppression. It was a little similar to Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s deep blue power.\n\nEdward didn\u2019t hesitate. He reached out to grab the currently-suppressed Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen tried to fight it off, but the King class suppression of the area was far too strong to compete with. Plus, Edward was half-deified. Although Han Sen\u2019s elemental prowess was very good for his level, it didn\u2019t have enough raw strength to counter this attack. He couldn\u2019t beat the suppressing force that was coming down on him.\n\nEdward\u2019s hand had almost reached Han Sen\u2019s neck when suddenly, Han Sen\u2019s hand lifted a small bird\u2019s nest. In his other hand, he raised a big army spear and thrust it toward Edward\u2019s chest.\n\nEdward was shocked. He hadn\u2019t expected Han Sen to brush off his King class area-of-effect technique. They were too close together for Edward to block Han Sen\u2019s, but Edward didn\u2019t hesitate. He ignored Han Sen\u2019s strike and continued reaching out to grab his prey by the throat.\n\nHan Sen was just a Duke. Even if his weapon was deified, it wouldn\u2019t do too much damage to Edward\u2019s half-deified body. If he was able to catch Han Sen at the same time, Edward had no qualm with accepting the strike.\n\nAt the moment Edward\u2019s fingers closed around Han Sen\u2019s neck, the Thunder God Spike was plunged into Edward\u2019s armor.\n\nThe armor stopped the Thunder God Spike dead, with only an inch of the weapon\u2019s tip embedding itself in Edward\u2019s breastplate.\n\nBut the Thunder God Spike\u2019s silver lightning completely ignored the defense offered by that armor. When it discharged, it sent a current of electricity directly into Edward\u2019s body. Edward shook as the power ran through him, and his electrified body was sent flying away.\n\nDong!\n\nHan Sen struck the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum again. Edward was still being ravaged by the silver lightning, and he couldn\u2019t gather his wits fast enough to summon power and repel the sonic attack. That sonic force was driven right into his forehead.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Even for a half-deified elite, hearing the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum felt like being stabbed in the head. Edward couldn\u2019t help but let out a shrill cry.\n\nHan Sen put the bird\u2019s nest on his head as he continued to pound the drum. He had no intention of remaining idle, though. He teleported directly in front of Edward and used his Thunder God Spike to strike at Edward once more.\n\nHalf-deified warriors deserved their reputation, and despite the dizziness and fierce pain, Edward tried to gather up power to block Han Sen\u2019s next attack.\n\nThe Thunder God Spike\u2019s power wasn\u2019t very destructive, but the lightning energy it released could bypass any form of defense. The lightning surged into every single cell of Edward\u2019s body. Edward shook under the force.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t have enough strength to use more than a tiny fraction of the Thunder God Spike\u2019s true power. Edward had only been numbed a little. If the Thunder God Spike was used by someone half-deified, a single hit would have left Edward shaking non-stop for an entire day.\n\nThe Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s sonic power swept into Edward in a continuous stream, but Edward was holding strong against the numbness induced by the lightning. He raised his shield again, and the sonic attacks began bouncing off of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too weak! If I was stronger, the silver lightning would have kept Edward from gathering enough power to resist,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He kept moving, though. Instead of thrusting with his Thunder God Spike, he resorted to beating Edward with it like some rod.\n\nAll that electricity had Edward shaking on the ground like he was experiencing a seizure. He was like a normal person being struck by a stun rod.\n\nIce Blue Knight King and the others, who were still in the midst of combat with the blood kirin, were frozen. The half-deified Edward was curled on the ground as Han Sen beat the pulp out of him. It was difficult to imagine.\n\nThey knew the extent of Edward\u2019s strength, and a Duke should have had no hope of repelling the golden godlight.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t seem hindered at all as he pounded Edward. Edward\u2019s defenses couldn\u2019t withstand the lightning power emitted by the rod, and the man screamed continually and frothed at the mouth. It was too frightening to watch.\n\n\u201cWhat, you won\u2019t treat me with respect unless I unleash my power?\u201d Han Sen kept hitting Edward, wondering how he might kill the man.\n\nThe lightning could bypass an opponent\u2019s defenses, but it couldn\u2019t actually kill anyone. And Han Sen couldn\u2019t do the job himself. He was too weak to break the man\u2019s armor, so he couldn\u2019t kill Edward with his strength alone.\n\n\u201cThe blood kirin!\u201d Han Sen thought. Then, he beckoned for the monster.\n\nThe blood kirin was still chasing the others, but Ice Blue Knight King and his group didn\u2019t dare to engage the beast. They were keeping it busy by baiting it back and forth.\n\nThe blood kirin\u2019s intelligence was low. They lured it left and right, to and fro, and it hadn\u2019t managed to kill any of them.\n\nAt the sound of Han Sen\u2019s voice, though, the beast turned to look at him. When it saw Han Sen slamming his fists into Edward, a light came into its eyes. It ran over, chomped down on Edward\u2019s head, and katcha! The armor was destroyed. Edward\u2019s head was bitten off.\n\nSevered arteries in the man\u2019s neck sprayed blood all over the blood kirin. It swallowed the head in a single gulp. The sight made Ice Blue Knight King and the others shiver in fear and anger."
