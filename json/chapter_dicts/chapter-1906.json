    "text": "\u201cThis is the life a woman should have. I\u2019ve wasted my life; I should have gotten rich instead.\u201d Lu Xiaomei was as pretty as the next snobbish woman. She was reveling in the high-tier service, and she was almost in tears.\n\nBao\u2019er called for a high-class massage, food, and drinks she had never tried before. She showed Lu Xiaomei what it felt like to be royalty.\n\nThis little witch can actually be quite cute. It is only just a kid, after all. Perhaps the creature is innocent, at times,\u201d Lu Xiaomei thought. She observed Bao\u2019er as she sipped on a drink.\n\n\u201cMiss Lu, are you enjoying this service?\u201d Bao\u2019er was holding onto a bottle of juice as she sipped it with a straw.\n\n\u201cYes, I love it! This place is great. Your family has very good taste.\u201d Lu Xiaomei had another sip of wine and felt so good.\n\n\u201cI am glad you like it. You can come whenever you like.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Xiaomei\u2019s eyes looked bright.\n\n\u201cOf course. I have already prepared a VIP card for you.\u201d Bao\u2019er clicked her fingers.\n\nQuickly, a waitress rushed over with a plate. She walked in front of Lu Xiaomei and put down the dish. Politely, she told her, \u201cMiss Lu, this is your very own VIP card.\u201d\n\nLu Xiaomei accepted the card, then saw a bill. The waitress said, \u201cAnd yes, this your bill for the day\u2019s services.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bill?\u201d Lu Xiaomei\u2019s face stiffened. When she looked at the bill, she almost fainted. She couldn\u2019t even pronounce the sum, but with all the numbers, she knew it was more than exorbitant.\n\nThe muscles in Lu Xiaomei\u2019s face twitched. She looked to be in a far worse state than someone crying their eyes out. \u201cBao\u2019er, you gave me all this! Wasn\u2019t this all a treat on you?\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s eyes opened wide, and she said with shock, \u201cI am just a kid! I don\u2019t have any money. I asked if this was what you wanted, and you said yes. You had me order all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cD*mn! This little thing must be doing all of this on purpose!\u201d Lu Xiaomei almost coughed up blood. Bao\u2019er\u2019s cute face had turned into a demon mask.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care! I didn\u2019t order all this. I am not paying.\u201d Lu Xiaomei jumped up.\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying? You\u2019re not paying?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at Lu Xiaomei with shock.\n\nLu Xiaomei wished to say there was nothing Bao\u2019er could do but pay it herself, when all of a sudden, two eight-foot-tall women stepped into the room. They stood in front of her.\n\nLu Xiaomei looked at their beefy arms and hastily took back her words. She replaced them by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough money to afford this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You are my teacher. So, why don\u2019t you sign this paper, and then we can make this bill all go away.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled and pulled a contract out of her little bag. She put it in front of her teacher, as if this was all going according to a scheme she had already planned out.\n\n\u201cD*mn! She prepared for this.\u201d Lu Xiaomei was grinding her teeth as she looked down at the contract.\n\nIt was a contract that required her to relinquish her very self. There were more than one hundred unfair terms on the contract, and if she signed it, she would be wholly owned by Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cI am not signing this, even if you kill me!\u201d Lu Xiaomei said through gritted teeth.\n\nBao\u2019er smiled. \u201cMiss Lu, what are you talking about? I have a decent club, and I won\u2019t hit you. But the stuff you have just enjoyed, the gambling you\u2019ve done, even the look on your face when shopping\u2026 It has all been recorded. You like the teacher Mister Luo, don\u2019t you? He\u2019s handsome and rich, yes? He is even chasing you, you know. I\u2019m thinking I should show him all the footage, and present him with your unpaid bill. The elegant image you have been clinging onto for so long will be gone with the wind. Think about that for a moment, and then reconsider whether or not you wish to sign this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHellspawn! You are hellspawn! The stuff you have is so expensive. A cup of wine costs thirty thousand! This is a scam!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe luxuries you have been enjoying were all imported from other planets. They are the best of the best, and some of them were even shura delicacies. Of course they are not cheap. If you\u2019d like, you can check the prices on Skynet. If you happen to find that our prices are too high, we will certainly price-match.\u201d Bao\u2019er smiled.\n\nLu Xiaomei struggled a bit. She signed the contract because of the handsome Mister Luo. Then she started to cry. Bao\u2019er patted her on the shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Work for me for fifty years, and you\u2019ll have paid off your debt. The contract will also be erased at that point.\u201d\n\nIt would have been better if Bao\u2019er hadn\u2019t said anything. Now the woman really wanted to cry.\n\nLu Xiaomei began walking out of the club. Fortunately, Bao\u2019er had already arranged for an aircraft to come and pick her up. If she hadn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have had the money to get home. Everything she had belonged to Bao\u2019er now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gone off course. You should go to the Eastern Lake,\u201d Lu Xiaomei said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who\u2019s driving this aircraft again?\u201d the driver asked snarkily, looking at her through his sunglasses.\n\nLu Xiaomei was furious. \u201cYeah, you are just the driver! Let me out so I can walk home.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d The driver stopped the aircraft and landed.\n\nLu Xiaomei got off the aircraft and kicked the door closed. She said, \u201cYou are all bad people! This karma will come back to bite you one day.\u201d\n\nShe turned and left. She eventually saw a familiar form walking nearby. It was her Prince Charming. It was Mister Luo.\n\n\u201cAfter having bad luck for so long, finally, something good! My Prince Charming, here I come!\u201d Lu Xiaomei walked towards Luo Yushu.\n\nBut just as she was about to greet him, she saw the woman with him. The woman was dressed sexily and holding his arm. She leaned close to him.\n\n\u201cLuo Yushu, who is this woman?\u201d Lu Xiaomei was so angry that she didn\u2019t even care about maintaining her image. She grabbed his arm and pointed at the woman.\n\nLuo Yushu was shocked. The woman then said, \u201cLuo Yushu, who is this woman?\u201d\n\nLuo Yushu\u2019s face changed, and he pushed Lu Xiaomei away. He explained to the woman, \u201cHoney, listen to me. She works in the kindergarten with me. She keeps hounding me for my love, despite me constantly pushing her away. She has never stopped, and even now, she follows me around.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuo Yushu, what are you saying?\u201d Lu Xiaomei was so angry. He was the one who kept chasing her, and she couldn\u2019t believe what he was now saying.\n\nThe woman looked at Lu Xiaomei, rolled her eyes, and said, \u201cYou are just a teacher! And yet, you want to steal a man away from someone like me? Are you crazy? I can give this man pocket money, the likes of which you will never earn in your lifetime. Maybe when I grow tired of him, you\u2019ll get your chance.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the woman walked forward and pushed Lu Xiaomei back. She kept herself from falling, but she still dropped everything she was holding in her hands.\n\n\u201cApologize to me, and then pick everything up.\u201d Lu Xiaomei was so angry, she wanted to throttle the woman.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy? Get lost! I told you I am not interested in you.\u201d Luo Yushu looked annoyed, and he also pushed her. He did not want her to hurt the woman he was currently with.\n\nWhen Luo Yushu pushed her, Lu Xiaomei fell back with nothing but anger and hopelessness.\n\nSuddenly, an arm grabbed her waist. It steadied her shoulders, then her body.\n\nShe opened her eyes and realized it was the driver with sunglasses.\n\nShe wished to say something, but the sky suddenly drew her attention. Many aircraft were suddenly headed towards them. In a minute, the vehicles had parked all around them, making the place very crowded.\n\nMany men, dressed in black with sunglasses, got out of their vehicles. They looked like gangsters as they gathered around.\n\n\u201cWhat are you people here for? What do you want?\u201d The woman and Luo Yushu began stepping back.\n\nLu Xiaomei looked at the aircraft around them: King, Steel, Silver, Ghost, Starry, Star, Miracle. They were all special editions that not just anyone could buy. Having a single one of them meant you were one of the super rich elite.\n\nNow that there were so many of them there, the woman and Luo Yushu were frozen. The men looked intimidating in their black clothes and sunglasses. It made the couple\u2019s legs grow soft.\n\nThe men dressed in black ignored the woman and Luo Yushu. They all walked in front of Lu Xiaomei and said, \u201cSecond Lady.\u201d\n\nLuo Yushu and the woman widened their eyes as if they had seen a ghost. They could barely stand on their feet.\n\nLu Xiaomei was just as dazed, too. She had no clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cSecond Lady, Miss Bao\u2019er asked us to come and pick you up,\u201d the driver said to Lu Xiaomei. And then, he looked at the woman and Luo Yushu and said, \u201cDid these two bully you? I can kill them for you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to do that! I will pick the stuff up. Please forgive me!\u201d The woman\u2019s legs were wobbling, and she raced to collect all the items Yu Xiaomei had dropped.\n\n\u201cShe forced me, Xiaomei. I did this for our future together,\u201d Luo Yushu said.\n\n\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Lu Xiaomei grabbed her bag and smacked him in the face with it. He hit the deck, so she went ahead and kicked him in the nuts. He writhed and screamed in pain.\n\nThe woman saw Lu Xiaomei looking back at her next. She slapped herself.\n\nPat! Pat! \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. Please forgive me!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lu Xiaomei gritted her teeth, and no longer paid them heed.\n\nThe driver opened the door to the aircraft, and there, Lu Xiaomei saw Bao\u2019er. She cried and went over to hold her, saying, \u201cBao\u2019er\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Bao\u2019er stroked her head and tried to comfort her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Bao\u2019er!\u201d Lu Xiaomei couldn\u2019t help but cry a little. She did her best to hold back her tears and look at the child with gratefulness.\n\nYou are welcome. I used two hundred and twenty-three aircraft to help you. The fuel for each comes to a sum of around seventy-eight thousand. With the wages for the drivers, and the damage\u2026\u201d Bao\u2019er fiddled with a calculator and whipped out another contract.\n\n\u201cHellspawn! You hellspawn!\u201d The aircraft echoed with Lu Xiaomei\u2019s screams."
