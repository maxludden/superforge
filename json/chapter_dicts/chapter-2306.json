It looked gorgeous.\n\nHan Sen turned the ring over and over in his hands, his face set in intense concentration.\n\nHe had chosen the ring because he was unable to identify its level. If something could block the vision of the Purple-Eye Butterfly, then it had to be good. There was every chance that it was also a deified item.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t as concerned with consequences as Bai Wei had been, so he picked this ring immediately.\n\nBut as Han Sen played with the ring, he realized he was unable to activate whatever power it possessed. Han Sen tried to trigger it by sending his own power into the ring, but there was no response. It was like an ordinary toy.\n\n\u201cWhy is there a ring here? What level is it?\u201d Bai Wei, upon seeing the ring, couldn\u2019t help but frown. There should only have been weapons in the Grave of Soldiers and Kings. She had never heard of anything else being found.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I can\u2019t activate it because the power of my element isn\u2019t correctly aligned,\u201d Han Sen thought. Then, he put the ring on his finger and said, \u201cI have already chosen this, so there\u2019s no time for regret. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nBai Wei looked at the ring on Han Sen\u2019s hand, and she didn\u2019t say anything. Together, they left The Grave of Soldiers and Kings and hurried towards the King\u2019s Garden.\n\nBai Wei didn\u2019t really care about the weapon she had chosen. She was in a rush to leave the Grave so that she could finally train in the King\u2019s Garden.\n\nThe King\u2019s Garden was at the center of the King\u2019s Kingdom. Han Sen and Bai Wei journeyed into the heart of the King\u2019s Kingdom, and suddenly, Han Sen\u2019s eyes brightened.\n\nA giant xenogeneic emerged from the darkness of space and flew right past them. It was as big as a planet, and it looked like a dinosaur from ancient times, but flames crackled across its body.\n\n\u201cThat is a Flaming Demon Dragon. It is a deified xenogeneic that patrols the entirety of the King\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d Bai Wei said.\n\nThe King\u2019s Kingdom was grander than Han Sen had imagined. There were many strange things there that continually snared his attention. So much so that he found it difficult to look away from the sights. Everywhere he looked, a myriad of creatures swept past them.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen saw something. He could not control his face at the sight, and so his jaw went slack.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bai Wei asked apprehensively.\n\nShe had seen Han Sen in all sorts of dangerous situations before, but he had never made a face like that.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Han Sen asked, pointing out in front of them.\n\nHan Sen pointed to an area in the system that had no day or night cycle. There was a giant building that looked like a star, but rather than residing on a planet, the entire building hung in space.\n\nIt was an ancient tower. It hung ethereally in space, like some kind of strange mirage. It was very old, mysterious, and cold. It felt like it didn\u2019t belong to that world, as it didn\u2019t match anything around it.\n\nThe tower was made of black stones, and it had seven floors. A black bell hung from each corner of the tower, but the bells weren\u2019t tolling at all; it was like they were frozen. They hung completely motionless, looking rather dead.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the tower\u2019s strange appearance that shocked Han Sen; he was caught off guard by the fact that the tower looked exactly like Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nBut this tower had been built from black stones, while Destiny\u2019s Tower was made entirely of metal. Everything else was the same, though. And when Han Sen saw the word \u201cDestiny\u201d written on the side of the tower, his stomach clenched. The word wasn\u2019t written in the common language of the geno universe, either. It was written in one of the ancient languages of the Alliance.\n\nBai Wei followed Han Sen\u2019s finger to the old tower that hung in space. After a pause, she said, \u201cThat is our holy tower. Only people who have performed amazing deeds are allowed to study in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly tower?\u201d Han Sen looked at Bai Wei with some confusion, hoping she could explain.\n\nBai Wei shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the holy tower. I only know that it is very mysterious. Anyone who enters it will become much stronger when they come back out. But only those of the Extreme King who have performed amazing feats are allowed entry, and no one who comes back out of the tower talks about what they saw inside. I don\u2019t know what is in there.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Bai Wei said, \u201cI have heard there is a mysterious geno art in there. It\u2019s a powerful art that provides great aid to any who learn it. But the people who go in usually emerge having learned different geno arts. It\u2019s difficult to guess what actually happens in the tower, and these are just rumors. I don\u2019t know how true they are. Only those who enter will know what is inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it something that some ancestor of the Extreme King left behind?\u201d Han Sen asked, trying to suppress his shock.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The legends say that the holy tower already existed when the King\u2019s Kingdom xenogeneic space was discovered. It is the same with Sky Palace\u2019s White Jade Jing. No one really knows why they exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this Destiny tower connected with my Destiny\u2019s Tower? Going by what I\u2019ve learned of history here, when the Extreme King\u2019s holy tower appeared, there should not have been any humans yet. Why is there Alliance text on the tower, then?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t stop thinking about this, but he could not figure it out.\n\nHan Sen was dying to enter the tower to take a look, but he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to even get close to the tower. It took all of his willpower to keep from staring at that ancient tower. To distract himself, he turned his attention back to the King\u2019s Garden.\n\nKing\u2019s Garden wasn\u2019t a planet, but a piece of land floating in space. It looked larger and lusher than a planet, though.\n\nA giant tree stood in the middle of the island in space, the tree\u2019s enormous canopy shading the entire landmass. It was too big to be properly described.\n\nThe tree\u2019s body was black, and its leaves were yellow. It looked very pretty.\n\nAfter they got close to King\u2019s Garden, Han Sen felt just how scary that King Tree was. Even a random leaf was bigger than an entire football stadium.\n\nWeird symbols were etched all across the leaves. As Han Sen got closer, the symbols turned out to be the veins of the leaves.\n\nBut each vein was unique, and they all possessed a mysterious, shifting power.\n\n\u201cThe King Tree is the Extreme King\u2019s source of culture. The symbols were adopted into the language of the Extreme King. Now, the official language of the Extreme King is Kingese. We only use the universal language with outsiders,\u201d Bai Wei explained.\n\nHan Sen nodded, and then he entered King\u2019s Garden with Bai Wei.\n\nThe mountains and rivers were all underneath that King Tree. It was hard to describe how glorious it all looked.\n\nOnce they landed on King\u2019s Garden, Han Sen looked around, dumbfounded. There were real dragons living near the mountains and rivers. They all had frightening presences, like godly creatures from ancient times.\n\n\u201cThey are not real dragons. They are the roots of the King Tree,\u201d Bai Wei said."
