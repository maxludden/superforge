    "text": "\u201cIf no one can compete against No Flower, this round will be over,\u201d Moon Wheel King said, as he stood up.\n\nHe understood the thoughts of those from Moon Garden, though. He knew no one else from Moon Garden could compete with what they had just witnessed. So, he did not want to waste any further time. It\u2019d only reflect poorly on the Rebate and Moon Garden.\n\n\u201cMoon Wheel King, I would like to suggest a friend that may be able to compete against No Flower.\u201d Du Lishe suddenly bowed before Moon Wheel King.\n\n\u201cLishe? What are you doing?\u201d Rebecca pulled her sister back, unsure what preposterous thing her sister was about the attempt.\n\n\u201cLishe? Which student are you recommending?\u201d Moon Wheel King was shocked by this. Du Lishe was his daughter, but he couldn\u2019t imagine who she might be hoping to suggest.\n\n\u201cWho I recommend is not someone privileged to be a member of Moon Garden. It is the student of Knife Queen, however. It is Han Sen of Planet Eclipse.\u201d Du Lishe smiled.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen was frozen. Thus far, he had only been spectating. The rest of Narrow Moon was frozen, too. No one expected Du Lishe would request Han Sen like that.\n\nQing Li was taken aback, too. She pulled Du Lishe close and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you not say Han Sen\u2019s words were far better than No Flower\u2019s? If that is true, then I recommend he be the one to compete against No Flower. If he wins, he will only make the Rebate look better,\u201d Du Lishe said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I thought. I don\u2019t know for a fact that Han Sen really is better,\u201d Qing Li said quickly.\n\nDu Lishe wore a mystic smile and said, \u201cIt does not matter, even if he does lose. He is not one of the Rebate, and he is not a member of Moon Garden. He can\u2019t embarrass us, even if he fails.\u201d\n\nQing Li did not know what to say to that. She stared at Du Lishe and said, \u201cIf he loses, it will embarrass Knife Queen. That\u2019d be even worse!\u201d\n\nBefore Du Lishe could say something more, Moon Wheel King frowned on stage and said, \u201cHan Sen is not on the member list.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoon Wheel King, I have heard about Knife Queen\u2019s student. If we can truly compete and compare our techniques, I would relish the chance.\u201d No Flower bowed before Moon Wheel King.\n\nWhen Speechless and No Flower returned from Planet Eclipse, they talked between each other about how they might get to know Han Sen more. The best way to do that was to force him on stage and challenge him to such a competition.\n\nHearing Du Lishe suggest Han Sen, the eyes of Speechless and No Flower gleamed with radiance. They wouldn\u2019t let this opportunity slip away. Before Speechless herself agreed, No Flower was agreeing.\n\nSince No Flower agreed, though, Moon Wheel King had no choice but to ask, \u201cIs Han Sen even here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Han Sen stood up and bowed before Moon Wheel King.\n\n\u201cAre you willing to compete against No Flower?\u201d Moon Wheel King asked.\n\n\u201cI am willing to,\u201d Han Sen answered. And it shocked everyone around the stage.\n\nEven Yisha, who was on Planet Blade, was flabbergasted to hear Han Sen agree to compete against No Flower.\n\nHan Sen thought that Yisha had let him come so that he could prove himself. He thought this had already been prearranged, and that\u2019s why he accepted the challenge so quickly. So, he had already prepared to show-off again and make Yisha take him even more seriously as a student. He hoped she would be willing to spend even more resources on his development.\n\nYisha actually wanted Han Sen to earn her some extra reputation, but No Flower\u2019s Touching Flower Finger was incredibly strong. It\u2019d be difficult to find a King class person to compete with that. So, she didn\u2019t expect this would be what Han Sen would agree to so soon.\n\n\u201cIn that case, you can come on stage and compete against No Flower.\u201d Moon Wheel King thought Du Lishe was trying to prank Han Sen, and that was why he asked Han Sen if he was willing to do it. It\u2019d also give Han Sen the chance to avoid participation.\n\nBut Han Sen was really willing to go on stage, and that shocked Moon Wheel King. Han Sen walked toward the stage, then stepped up to the testing gold rock.\n\n\u201cAmitabha! Mister Han, we meet again! To be able to compete against you in the display of geno arts is a grand honor,\u201d No Flower nodded and said.\n\n\u201cAre you being polite?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he walked closer to the testing gold rock. He wasn\u2019t keen on talking too much with the Buddha.\n\nSpeechless looked at Han Sen. She really wanted to see how Han Sen would choose to compete with No Flower. She didn\u2019t believe he could actually have a skill that exceeded what they had just witnessed, though.\n\nNo matter what the case might be, this was a fine opportunity to observe Han Sen. Speechless watched intently, not wanting to miss out on a single detail.\n\nMany Nobles of Narrow Moon were not happy with the concept of Han Sen actually going on stage.\n\n\u201cHe is just a Baron. He is actually going to compete with No Flower? Even if you used your *ss to think, you\u2019d know that this won\u2019t end well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not a member of Moon Garden. To hear him actually be recommended\u2026 Why would Du Lishe invite him? Does she want to embarrass him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t Han Sen just say no when Moon Wheel King asked him? It\u2019d be better than being humiliated here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know what he is thinking. He is just a Baron, after all. He actually thinks his skills can rival those of No Flower, which were learned from a Buddha King? He\u2019s just asking to get beaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is cocky. Far too cocky. He got a King class knife and practiced Teeth knife, but so what? His confidence grew way too quickly, and he is acting far too big for his britches.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is brave, but obviously stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will be very embarrassing. Han Sen going up against No Flower is like a fake product being taste-tested in a face- off versus the real thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he can go up there, I can do it, too. At least I\u2019m a Viscount!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even an Earl would be able to do much versus that. I felt the will earlier, and it was really crushing.\u201d\n\nRebecca frowned and scolded Du Lishe. \u201cThis has gone too far! Although Han Sen is not a member of Moon Garden, he is now representing the Rebate in this competition. It will be embarrassing for us if he loses.\u201d\n\nDu Lishe shrugged and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame this on me. He is the one who decided to come up here. He could have said no. It\u2019s not my fault that he insisted.\u201d\n\nQing Li thought about things for a moment, and then said, \u201cIf Han Sen was willing to go, that also means he is confident about winning. Maybe he really does have a mind that was stronger than No Flower\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d Rebecca and Du Lishe said at the same time. They did not believe Han Sen could beat No Flower. No Flower was so strong, it was like he was cheating.\n\nDu Lishe recommended Han Sen just for fun, though. She didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d win.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Rebecca and Du Lishe thinking this way, however. Most of the Rebate didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win, either. Not even Moon Wheel King and Yisha herself.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t trouble his mind with all this, though. He had a plan. He walked up to the testing gold rock and had a look at what No Flower had written. With his finger, he drew on the other side."
