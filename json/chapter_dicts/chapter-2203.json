    "text": "Han Sen took Huangfu Jing back with him to Planet Eclipse. She had just earned her own Jade Drum, and since she was worried about being ambushed while out-and-about, she wanted to stay there for some time. She would wait until things settled down before moving on.\n\nSonic Butterfly King had learned where Han Sen came from, but it would be pointless to go after Han Sen when he was already so far behind. He managed to get in touch with people to block Han Sen\u2019s way, but they were unable to find him, either. So, eventually, Sonic Butterfly King decided to give up.\n\nAfter all, they couldn\u2019t go into Narrow Moon to find him. They couldn\u2019t risk offending the Rebate.\n\nOn his way back, Han Sen dropped a few droplets of his own blood onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. He hoped to earn the Jade Drum\u2019s approval gradually.\n\nIn Planet Eclipse\u2019s base, people were in the middle of practice when a sudden report was received. Someone came running in, telling them of an army of xenogeneics converging on their position.\n\nHan Meng\u2019er, Zero, Little Angel, and Han Yan went out to take a look. There, they found a mountain that was swarmed with what appeared to be red clouds. The clouds were heading toward the base so quickly that they\u2019d arrive in only a little while.\n\nThe red clouds weren\u2019t clouds, of course. They were swarms of red bees that were each the size of a dog. They were very powerful, and the sight made Han Yan frown. \u201cWhen did Planet Eclipse come to possess xenogeneics such as this? I have never seen them before.\u201d\n\nAs this occurred, Night River King was watching Planet Eclipse\u2019s base. His expression looked venomous, and he said, \u201cShadow Queen Bees are special xenogeneics that come from Planet Queen Bee. They are only Dukes, but they sure breed quickly. If there\u2019s enough food, she can make lower-level Shadow Bees. But that primary Shadow Queen a mutant Duke xenogeneic. Aside from being able to produce Shadow Bees like the rest, the mutant Shadow Queen Bee can also produce Duke Shadow Bees. The Queen didn\u2019t have much time, and it has only produced two thus far, but that should be enough to deal with Han Sen\u2019s base.\u201d\n\n\u201cShadow Queen Bees eat the flesh of enemies and place their eggs inside the carcasses. Ah, when Han Sen returns and sees all this, the look on his face will be so sweet\u2026\u201d Night River King gritted his teeth.\n\nNight River King wasn\u2019t worried about the consequences. A Shadow Queen Bee was one of the xenogeneics that escaped from the cargo ship. It would look like an accident, and no one would know that it was his fault.\n\nEven if Han Sen believed it was him, there was nothing he could do but make wild accusations. Night River King wanted this, though. He wanted Han Sen to hate him. It would be painful for Han Sen to know he couldn\u2019t do anything about that seething hatred.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of making me your enemy,\u201d Night River King spat. He really loathed Han Sen.\n\nThe Shadow Bees appeared like wisps of red clouds under the command of the two Dukes in charge of the army. They raced towards the base. Night River King was prepared to enjoy the fight, but a blue shield suddenly appeared. It enveloped the entire base and shielded it.\n\nThe red clouds of Shadow Bees came down like a barrage against the blue shields, but a mere touch sent them blasting back. Even the two Duke Shadow Bees up front were unable to get through.\n\nNight River King\u2019s jaw tightened. He felt a little frustrated about the result, as he hadn\u2019t expected Han Sen to leave his blue shield treasure in the base.\n\nNight River King thought Han Sen would carry a defensive item such as that everywhere he went. If he knew Han Sen hadn\u2019t taken it with him, he wouldn\u2019t have concocted the grand scheme to attack Planet Eclipse. If Han Sen didn\u2019t have the shield, fighting him one-on-one would be far easier.\n\nThere was no point in wasting time on regret, though. The Shadow Bees were unable to break the shield.\n\nThe Shadow Bees fired a toxic substance from their nasty stingers. They were like red lights as they splashed across the blue shield. They did nothing to harm the composition of the shield, though.\n\nAlthough the shield was weakened by the fact that it had to protect the entire base, it would still be very difficult for Marquises and Dukes to break it down.\n\nAs Night River King wrestled with various ideas, the blue shield suddenly disappeared. The bees outside came racing in.\n\n\u201cDid it fail because the shield\u2019s user didn\u2019t have enough strength?\u201d Night River King wondered. \u201cCould the user not keep the shield raised?\u201d\n\nSoon after, Night River King realized that his assumption hadn\u2019t been quite right. When a fair number of those Shadow Bees came racing in, the shield was raised once more. Most of the Shadow Bees were still on the outside, but a decent chunk had made it in.\n\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\n\nBlack arrows began flying beneath the shield. Not long after, a dozen of the Shadow Bees on the inside were slain.\n\nAnd then, a group of Kate appeared. They began gathering the bodies of the Shadow Bees inside the base.\n\nNight River King\u2019s eyes began to twitch. His plan hadn\u2019t worked, and he had just given Planet Eclipse a massive number of free xenogeneics. He wished he could go in there himself and destroy what Han Sen had built.\n\nWhen the Kate kids brought the Shadow Bee bodies back into the base, the shield disappeared again. It reappeared a millisecond later, shutting off another section of the Shadow Bee army.\n\nNight River King laughed. One of the Shadow Bees inside was a Duke. The others were just Marquises. No matter how strong they were, no one there could slay a Duke Shadow Bee.\n\nNight River King was already imagining how the Duke Shadow Bee would slaughter them all when suddenly, a black arrow came at the Duke Shadow Bee.\n\nThe Duke Shadow Bee reacted quickly, far more quickly than any Marquise Shadow Bee could have managed. As the black arrow rose toward it, the bee\u2019s stinger lit up and fired a toxic squirt at the arrow.\n\nThe toxic juice sprayed toward the arrow, and the arrow suddenly sank. It adjusted its course to duck under the toxic juice, then it rose against and punched through Duke Shadow Bee\u2019s body with great speed.\n\nThe Shadow Bee was shining red. When the arrow pierced its body, the arrow came to a stop.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to kill a Duke Shadow Bee.\u201d Night River King laughed mockingly.\n\nBoom!\n\nWhen the arrow entered the Shadow Bee\u2019s body, it was trapped inside. But then, a scary explosion occurred within the Duke Shadow Bee\u2019s body.\n\nThe red light shattered, and a gaping hole was torn in its side. It was heavily injured, and it fell to struggle on the ground.\n\nBoom!\n\nAnother arrow was fired at it. It pierced through the Shadow Bee via the already-dealt wound. The creature\u2019s head then blew up, bringing a swift end to the Duke Shadow Bee.\n\nWhile that happened, the rest of the Marquise Shadow Bees were dealt with by Han Yan.\n\n\u201cHow is this possible? That woman is just a Marquise, and yet she can so simply kill a Duke Shadow Bee? This is impossible! She is Han Sen\u2019s blood, but since when have crystallizers ever been that strong?\u201d Night River King was incredibly angry, and he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes."
