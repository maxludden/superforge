    "text": "\u201cI need the genes of other creatures to keep myself from turning into a god.\u201d Violet turned to look at the giant jade god. His eyes looked very sincere as he spoke.\n\nXie Qing King laughed out loud. He lifted his lips and said, \u201cYou make it sound so good. I think you need the genes of other creatures to avoid turning into a vegetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a test given to me by a god. It is the first step on my path of ascendance. The first step for me becoming a god,\u201d Violet said coldly. He didn\u2019t seem shaken or put off by Xie Qing King\u2019s mockery.\n\nHan Sen was still a bit confused by all this, so he asked, \u201cIf you need the genes of other creatures, why aren\u2019t you gathering the genes from the creatures that are dying up above us? Why are you praying to the god down here?\u201d\n\nViolet smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to take part in the chaos on the surface. When you guys came down here, everything was settled. You guys will become the sacrifice to the god, and I will take his place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m understanding you correctly, what you\u2019re saying is that you aren\u2019t the one who needs the genes. It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Han Sen asked, pointing at the giant jade god.\n\n\u201cYou are quite smart. The power of the god\u2019s corpse is too strong. If I absorb it immediately, my body won\u2019t be able to withstand its power. But if I let the god\u2019s corpse absorb the genes of other creatures, those genes might help to soften the god\u2019s energy. Then, I can absorb the power of the god\u2019s corpse. Once the power is diluted slightly, it shouldn\u2019t be as destructive to my body.\u201d It seemed like the plan had almost succeeded. Violet was in a good mood, and he clearly wanted someone else to appreciate how successful his plan had been. That was why he was taking the time to brag to Han Sen and Xie Qing King.\n\nHan Sen sighed and shook his head. \u201cYou are pathetic. I didn\u2019t think you would be so stupid as to do something like this. You are about to become his sacrifice, too.\u201d\n\nViolet smiled and said, \u201cI know what you mean, but that\u2019s impossible. When gods die, they die. It doesn\u2019t matter how powerful they were in life; once they\u2019re dead, they\u2019re just inanimate objects.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure that is true?\u201d Han Sen kept an eye on the jade giant. He didn\u2019t think a god would die so easily.\n\n\u201cOf course. I want to let him absorb the genes of other creatures, and I have expended a lot of effort making this happen. The more genes he has, the more power I will get.\u201d Violet sounded very confident.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if all the men who had fallen under a god\u2019s thumb were this dumb, but it was clear that Violet was completely convinced. It was like Violet was being sold as a slave, yet he was taking pride in calculating how much he was worth.\n\n\u201cTime is almost up. You guys should offer up your power for me to become a god.\u201d As Violet was speaking, a jade substance chain rose from his body. The purple flower on his head turned green and sparkled like a piece of crystal.\n\n\u201cDeified power is nothing special. When I become a god, I will show the universe the true meaning of power. True god deifieds will be eliminated on a whim. The Very High, Ancient Gods, and Extreme Kings will be wiped out. The only high race in the universe will be the Flower Gods. I will be the leader of the universe.\u201d Violet\u2019s eyes were brimming with passion.\n\n\u201cWhat a naive kid. You should wait until you\u2019ve become a god to make proclamations like that.\u201d Xie Qing King quickly retreated. Then, he shouted at Han Sen, \u201cBrother, I will leave you to deal with this psycho. Get rid of him. I don\u2019t want to become food.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when did you learn how to fall back?\u201d Han Sen thought that was strange. Xie Qing King had retreated. That had never been the man\u2019s style before.\n\n\u201cIt would be stupid to fight when I know the likelihood of my death is very high.\u201d Xie Qing King lit up a cigar and clamped it between his teeth as he spoke to Han Sen. \u201cI\u2019m not deified yet, so I will let you perform. Enjoy the moment before I catch up with you. When I become deified, your time to shine will be up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy is becoming more and more human.\u201d Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King happily. When he was in the sanctuaries, he had been blinded by the need to fight. He would never have behaved so rationally.\n\n\u201cTeacher Xie, I like your comics, and I admire your talent a great deal. But real life is not a comic. Right now, Bai Wanjie and those other nobles are nothing compared to me. I am stronger. I am afraid your guard will be of no protection to you.\u201d As Violent spoke, his substance chains became green vines. They writhed like long dragons as they reached out for Han Sen.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Han Sen was trapped between the vines. He was wrapped up like filling in a dumpling.\n\n\u201cTeacher Xie, before I kill you, I will let you witness the power of a god. It is a shame you will be unable to draw this for one of your comics.\u201d Violet\u2019s eyes looked spaced-out. The green vines were hollow likes hoses, and they looked as if they were going to suck something out of Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cGod is above everything. God controls everything. God can take away everything. Although I am not God, I can take anyone\u2019s power for myself.\u201d Violet\u2019s face was full of haughty confidence as he finished boasting, but then his eyes widened.\n\nThe green vines were attempting to suck Han Sen\u2019s power out of his body, but it wasn\u2019t working. Nothing was being drawn from him. That confused Violet a bit.\n\nXie Qing King laughed and said, \u201cI forgot to tell you. You aren\u2019t God yet. And even if you did become God, it would be pointless. That is because the guy in front of you is God\u2019s Daddy. Even if you become God, you would still have to kneel before him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2014\u201d Violet didn\u2019t even get the chance to finish his sentence.\n\nPang!\n\nThe green substance chains that had become vines were suddenly shattered. Han Sen walked safely out of their clutches. He looked at Violet and said, \u201cThat was the breadth of your amazing god powers?\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible\u2026 Even Bai Wanjie couldn\u2019t tear down my powers so easily\u2026 But you\u2026 Who are you?\u201d Violet looked at Han Sen with shock.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Daddy!\u201d Han Sen said simply. He walked up to Violet, and his body was suddenly cloaked in half-transparent white armor. His form was wreathed in a white flame.\n\nViolet recomposed his power with the intent of fighting Han Sen, but when he generated his green substance chains, he froze. He was suddenly hanging in the air, and he couldn\u2019t move. It was like he had been pinned in space.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you?\u201d Violet was shocked as he realized he could no longer use his power. His body and his power were like a volcano that was ready to erupt, but he couldn\u2019t quite release an attack.\n\nHan Sen kept walking forward. The Dongxuan Area controlled the universal cogwheels of the encompassing zone. Unless Violet\u2019s power was stronger than his, the Flower God wouldn\u2019t be able to use his universal cogwheel. He wouldn\u2019t be able to unleash his power."
