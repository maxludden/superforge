The Luo family had the Shura\u2019s Falsified-Sky Sutra, which made the Luo family and Shura\u2019s Jade Shura fall into a generation of loving and killing.\n\nDuring Luo Lan\u2019s generation, Han Sen\u2019s mother wanted to prevent their heirs from falling into the same cycle. Thus, they hid their names in the hopes that Han Sen could lead a normal life. Unfortunately, it did not work. Han Sen received the Asura Sutra by accident. He had also found Zero, who had a strong connection with the Shura.\n\nThe little sister, Han Yan, practiced the Luo family\u2019s Falsified-Sky Sutra. Ever since then, Han Sen\u2019s family and the Shura, or the Asura King who created the Shura, had a fate that always caused them to be coiled around each other in some capacity.\n\nAfter Han Sen entered the geno universe, he believed the Demons might have been connected to the Shura, but he lacked proof for the allegation.\n\nNow, Demon Alpha looked exactly like Zero. Han Sen\u2019s head was filled with a bevy of thoughts. He was not so sure what he was thinking.\n\nThat was only for a moment. After Demon Alpha\u2019s shadow was expunged, scary thunder and Dragon Breath came together to annihilate her body.\n\nDemon Alpha had been tied-up in the same spot all that time, but she was finally able to move a little. One of her hands was forcing through to break the power that bound her. She summoned a little knife.\n\nIt was less than a foot long. As she held it in her jade hand, the grey knife looked like a dried bone.\n\nThe moment Demon Alpha clutched the little dry bone knife, it was like her arm had some sort of weird power. It was able to make her power move inside that trapped space.\n\nThe little dry bone knife flashed in front of Demon Alpha. In the next moment, the nine-headed, gold, giant Dragon head was spilling Dragon Blood. It flew into space.\n\nThe big Dragon head had been cut off, forcing the bindings on her to be dropped. Demon Alpha\u2019s body flashed like a ghost. The thunder and Dragon Breath landed next to her. It kept exploding in space, blowing up all the planets around.\n\nDemon Alpha\u2019s shadow recovered. She was once again cloaked in darkness, but one could still see the little dry bone knife. It was not affected by the darkness.\n\nBefore the creatures that were watching the fight reacted, Demon Alpha\u2019s body was already on the move. She swung the little dry bone knife in her hands.\n\nThe small knife, which was less than a foot long, drew a curve in space that did not look particularly eye-catching. It seemed like a random swing. It was not much stronger than as if she had been drawing.\n\nIn space, underneath this drawing, the gold nine-headed Dragon\u2019s fire element dragon head was cut off. Dragon Blood came spewing out of the severed neck like lava. The rest of the seven heads painfully roared.\n\nBoom! The big Dragon\u2019s thunder head and soul head spit out scary power at the same time toward Demon Alpha.\n\nThe thunder head had just opened its eyes. Before it spat out thunder, an invisible slash cut off its head.\n\nUnder the flickering starlight, Demon Alpha\u2019s shadow-like body flashed. The dry bone knife was thrust out again. Many dragon heads were flying through space. Dragon Blood was coming down like heavy rain everywhere.\n\nThunder head, cold head, crazy dragon head\u2026 All these scary dragon heads were like chickens or dogs being cut up. The Dragon Blood dyed the whole of space with a gold color.\n\nAll the creatures looked at the demon-looking, ghost-looking shadow. They were frozen. The lightly swaying little dry bone knife, painful dragon bones, flying dragon heads, spilling blood\u2026 All the creatures gazed upon the crazy scene. They were scared. Their fear could not be described.\n\nThe crazy knife and cold starlight mingled with the gold Dragon Blood being sprayed out. It looked quite strange.\n\nThe big, invincible nine-headed gold Dragon suddenly had eight of its head cut off. It had not even been given a moment to fight back. The invincible Dragon God Body was like paper. It did not even see the knife lights or weapons that were landing on it. It led to all the dragon heads flying through space with blood.\n\nEven Han Sen, who knew a lot about Asura Sutra and was not from a normal race, had a scalp that felt numb. His entire body flared with goosebumps.\n\nAsura Power was practiced to this level by Demon Alpha. It was almost invincible. As long as the opponent had some cause, it could not avoid her attacks.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe reaper\u2019s scythe-looking dry bone knife went across space. The nine-headed, gold, Dragon\u2019s final head was split in half, along with its giant gold Dragon body.\n\nThe whole universe was silent. The gold blood spread through space. It was like a golden ocean.\n\nThe Dragon\u2019s head, body, and blood were shaking in space. The Dragon tried to regenerate and become the nine-headed, gold, big Dragon again.\n\nDemon Alpha did not move. She stood in space. She raised the little dry bone knife and started to swing it. She looked like a reaper as she slashed everything.\n\nAll the dragon heads were cut in half before they could combine with the body, and the Dragon\u2019s body was cut into pieces.\n\nThe heads were angry. They roared. In the next second, they were being cut open.\n\n\u201cHow dare you kill the dragon heads. My race will persist to avenge this\u2026\u201d In the Dragon realm, many Dragons were roaring, which shook the sky.\n\nDragon One was the leader of that generation of Dragons. He was a scary being that was able to become a true god. He was the only true god of the Dragons. He would soon become the leader of the Dragons.\n\nIf he was killed on the space battlegrounds, the Dragons would suffer a major loss. It would take them hundreds of thousands of years to recover.\n\nAs much as they let out their roars, Demon Alpha did not hear a single one. Even if she did hear them, it was unlikely that she cared. The little dry bone knife kept swinging.\n\nMoaning, roaring, fear, scared, hopeless\u2026 Whatever emotion was displayed did not stop the hand wielding the little dry bone knife.\n\nBefore, when the gold, nine-headed Dragon\u2019s power had almost destroyed her body, Demon Alpha already wanted to kill him. Why would she put her knife away now?\n\nA knife slashed Dragon One\u2019s head. Its blood-curdling cries were heard throughout space.\n\nThis was a day that would be remembered. The gold, nine-headed Dragon had been chopped to pieces. Space was dyed gold. A hopeless Dragon moan echoed through the universe. Dragon One\u2019s shadow was in space, but the shadow instantly turned to dust. It scattered away with the sky full of gold Dragon Blood.\n\nEvery Dragon\u2019s body shook. They all cried bloody tears. They could not believe Dragon One had been killed in space like that. He was the first true god class creature that had been killed in the geno god list fight.\n\n\u201cI am Demon Alpha. Whoever offends the Demon will be slashed.\u201d Demon Alpha\u2019s cold voice echoed through space.\n\nFrom this day on, every creature in the universe was going to remember that name and sentence."
