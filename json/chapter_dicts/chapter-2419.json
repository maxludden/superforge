    "text": "Miss Mirror hadn\u2019t thought Han Sen\u2019s mind was strong, and the unexpected depth of his consciousness struck her with confusion.\n\nIt was as if she had received a mystery gift, and she had no idea who had delivered it or what it contained. After opening that special parcel, she only found another mystery box inside. She opened it, layer by layer, but there never seemed to be an end.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter if the gift deep inside the layers of the package was good or bad; opening a gift like this would make people angry.\n\nLuckily, Miss Mirror was a very patient person, so she didn\u2019t look annoyed. She peeled open Han Sen\u2019s mind, layer by layer. But after doing this for a while, she still hadn\u2019t found what lay at its center.\n\nNot even God had enough patience to keep searching endlessly like that. After Miss Mirror peeled away all those layers, her inability to find the center was too much. She didn\u2019t like feeling this way.\n\n\u201cI want to see what resides in your mind,\u201d Miss Mirror thought in determination. Gathering herself, she leaned the full weight of her deified mind atop Han Sen\u2019s mind to try to crack it open.\n\nSpring Rain destroyed flowers. Han Sen\u2019s will was like the center of a flower that was being forced open. One by one, the petals fell. But when the place covered by the petals was finally revealed, she found that it was empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a shell, with nothing on the inside.\u201d Miss Mirror felt rather disappointed.\n\nMinds represented someone\u2019s personality and the way they felt things. Han Sen\u2019s mind was very strong on the outside, but its interior was hollow. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t be considered someone strong.\n\nMiss Mirror wanted to pull her mind back since she was done investigating, but suddenly, she couldn\u2019t.\n\nShe had opened Han Sen\u2019s mind using brute force. A normal mind would have been shattered by such an act. There shouldn\u2019t have been left a trace of that mind left.\n\nBut Miss Mirror could still detect Han Sen\u2019s mind with her own will. That was unexpected.\n\nThe mind moved. Miss Mirror\u2019s eyes lowered, and she looked at all of the petals across the floor. Every petal was like a crystal. They were scattered across the floor, but they weren\u2019t damaged.\n\nThe will that Miss Mirror had detected invaded one of the petals, and as it did, Miss Mirror\u2019s eyes widened. She had only wanted to peel away the petals to see what was on the inside. She hadn\u2019t bothered to look at the petals themselves.\n\nThe mind entered the petal, and suddenly, that consciousness was like a rolling, storm-shaken sea. It was as wide as a sky and as deep as an ocean. The mind was so rich that Miss Mirror staggered under the detailed sensation of it.\n\nMiss Mirror bent and picked up another petal. The will was like a mountain crashing down. It was like a pillar that held up the sky, never moving.\n\nIf she was a novel, this man would be a grand saga.\n\nA man could define himself as a broken, sick, elderly man on his deathbed, or as the warrior who threw himself into the thick of battle when he was young.\n\nPeople only focused on results. Wins and losses determined all, and rarely did people pay attention to what led up to those places. People often failed to see the desperation and difficult times men have to face frequently. Endurance and bravery abound in the hearts of men.\n\nEveryone fails sometimes, but real men get up and keep going despite their losses. No matter what environment they are in or what happens to their bodies, the only thing that can\u2019t be changed is the wants and desires of their hearts. They want victory, with the determination to win is greater than anything.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s will didn\u2019t have a core because real men have no end. Ambitions grew continually, stretching out beyond the reaches of space and time. Forward. Forward. And forward again until their time of death.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t looking to climb the highest mountains. He wanted to go further and higher. His ambitions had no end. Infinity went on forevermore.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t see the core of Han Sen\u2019s mind, but every petal was what Han Sen had experienced. There was anger, happiness, sadness, endurance, sensations of sea, and sky, and earth.\n\nPerhaps one single mind didn\u2019t make Han Sen better than Miss Mirror, but by observing all of those petals and understanding them, Miss Mirror couldn\u2019t help but feel awed.\n\nSuddenly, Miss Mirror raised her head. She realized she was trapped inside Han Sen\u2019s mind. His emotions were affecting her mood.\n\n\u201cI cannot stay in a place that bothers my heart,\u201d Miss Mirror said with an implacable face. She summoned her Spring Rain mind, wanting to destroy the mirror where Han Sen had sent his will. She didn\u2019t want her own will to be affected.\n\nTen thousand petals were destroyed by her mind, but Miss Mirror soon found out that when the petals were destroyed, they fell to the ground like seeds. New flowers then opened.\n\nNo matter how Miss Mirror\u2019s mind raged or how she tried to destroy Han Sen\u2019s will, the flowers grew. She couldn\u2019t destroy them, only spread them further.\n\n\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d Miss Mirror wondered, stupefied. She couldn\u2019t remain calm. She couldn\u2019t completely destroy Han Sen\u2019s mind. It was an impossible task.\n\nShe was a deified elite. Her mind was one of the strongest in the whole of the Extreme King, and yet she couldn\u2019t deal with Han Sen, who just a meager King. She couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.\n\n\u201cIs his will really this strong?\u201d Miss Mirror examined at her will, where flowers were half-opened. She looked at them strangely.\n\nDing!\n\nMiss Mirror took a step back. She separated the two Mirror Spirit Eye Rings and looked right at Han Sen.\n\nMiss Mirror discovered that her mind was melting quickly into Han Sen\u2019s body. Seconds later, it was all gone. Even Miss Mirror could no longer feel it. The Mirror Spirit Eye\u2019s mind that had been sent to Han Sen had been extinguished by him.\n\n\u201cThank you, My Lady.\u201d Han Sen opened his eyes and bowed before Miss Mirror.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s Spring Rain mind had allowed Han Sen to learn a lot, and he was very thankful for the opportunity.\n\nWhen Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, her expression was inscrutable. She didn\u2019t say anything, and she merely departed.\n\nWhen she returned to her room, Miss Mirror used many methods to try to erase Han Sen\u2019s influence, but try as she might, she couldn\u2019t. It greatly annoyed Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cAm I not as good as a mere King?\u201d Miss Mirror chewed her lip and tried to use her mind to erase the flowers that stood for Han Sen\u2019s mind. Her efforts were futile. Those mind flowers had taken a firm root inside her mind. No matter how she tried to destroy them, the roots remained. They could keep growing again and again.\n\nFlowers know the sea. Half-open and half-hidden. Wildflowers kept burning. The wind blew, and the process started again.\n\nMiss Mirror\u2019s crew had been working in the stone fields for five days, and after that time passed, something weird happened. A worker dug up a rock that was the size of a mortar and pestle. A few words were engraved on the side of the rock.\n\nThe two Marquises that dug up the rock read the text, and all of a sudden, they became Dukes.\n\nMiss Mirror went out to the stone field with Red Cloud and brought the rock back to camp. After their second day examining the rock, the deified Red Cloud was reduced to King class overnight."
