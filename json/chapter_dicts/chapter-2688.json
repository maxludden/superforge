    "text": "\u201cHave you thought about Under the Sky\u2019s flaws?\u201d Exquisite asked, glancing at Li Keer.\n\nLi Keer shook her head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\nExquisite shook her head as well. She frowned and said, \u201cFor us, silkworms are a way of gaining new understanding. However, they aren\u2019t merely tools for learning. Our situation now is both good and bad. On the positive side, we\u2019re learning a lot from Han Sen, and he\u2019s allowed us to feel what having a truly powerful will is like. He will help us accelerate our growth. But if we keep learning and following him, we will simply be copying his progress. We will be aping him, so to speak. And no matter how closely we try to replicate what he has done, we will never achieve what the true Han Sen can accomplish. The path we tread must be one that leads to glory greater than our silkworm\u2019s. We need to trailblaze a path of our own. But with the way things are now, that might be a very difficult prospect.\u201d\n\nLi Keer cut in quickly. \u201cPerhaps, but Han Sen\u2019s will is too strong. At our level, we won\u2019t be able to pinpoint his flaws for our own betterment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can confess something like that is terrible, without a doubt. He is supposed to be our silkworm. We are not supposed to be his. If Han Sen leaves the impression that we cannot exceed his talents, then we are already limited by him,\u201d Exquisite said with a look of seriousness.\n\n\u201cIn that case, what do you propose we do about it?\u201d Li Keer couldn\u2019t think of a way around this problem.\n\nIf Han Sen left an indelible impression of invincibility on their peers, then their achievements would be forever overshadowed by his own. That wasn\u2019t the sort of silkworm they were looking for.\n\n\u201cHan Sen needs to lose once. A loss is the only way that impression of him can be erased from our hearts,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cEven Shale lost to him. I highly doubt that any other silkworm will come close to rivaling him in the near future.\u201d Li Keer looked at Exquisite with confusion. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what her Third Sister was implying.\n\n\u201cWhy do you suggest it has to be a silkworm? Now that Han Sen has achieved first place, he should be able to go to Jail Demon Hall. He can start practicing there. First, it will be a great help for his own abilities. Secondly, he will probably get crushed. Once that happens, he will lose his confidence and cockiness. Thirdly, it will break the image we have of him. We\u2019ll have a hard time viewing him as being so incredible if he gets defeated. That sounds like three birds with one stone, if you ask me,\u201d Exquisite said coldly.\n\n\u201cThis is a brilliant idea. Now, let us go and register his application to enter Jail Demon Hall. Open Sky Elder earned a lot from Han Sen, so I doubt he will refuse his request to go there,\u201d Li Keer replied merrily.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er were still fishing at Underworld Lake. Li Keer gave an Underworld Silk to Bao\u2019er, so Han Sen no longer had to share his own. But Han Sen was still feeling quite depressed. After he fished up the Xuan Yellow Sutra, the only things he had pulled from the lake were utter trash. Rusted armor and broken weapons were a frequent sight. He had even collected bits of broken statues and the like.\n\nOne time had been particularly bad. While he was fishing, he latched onto something super heavy. He had instantly assumed, based on the weight, that he had snagged something amazing. He spent half the day reeling it in. When he finally pulled it free of the lake, it was just a three-meter-tall statue with shoulders and legs missing. Han Sen\u2019s lungs almost exploded.\n\nBao\u2019er was sometimes able to fish up pieces of jewelry. Han Sen didn\u2019t know what they were for.\n\nAnd also, the entire time, the 16 pigs continued to follow Bao\u2019er around. They frequently munched on Bao\u2019er\u2019s snacks, but they didn\u2019t grow at all. They each remained the size of a fist. They looked small and cute, but as far as Han Sen could tell, they were completely useless. If they were not spending their days eating and sleeping, they were sleeping and eating. It was either that or following Bao\u2019er\u2019s *ss and running around everywhere.\n\n\u201cDad, come here! There is something coming. It is so heavy\u2026\u201d Bao\u2019er suddenly exclaimed.\n\nHan Sen quickly approached her, and he started tugging the string. It really did feel like something absurdly heavy. It was like the other end of the string was attached to a small mountain.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er used all their strength as they tried to reel in the Underworld Silk from the lake. After pulling it for a while, they finally saw something coming up from below the swirling clouds. They could see its corner as it rose from the mist.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Han Sen looked shocked when he saw the item.\n\nBased on what he could see, Han Sen could tell that the item was built from bronze. It had an opening that was one meter wide at the top and narrowed as it went farther down.\n\nAs the bronze item was slowly pulled up, more and more of it appeared above the fog. Han Sen could soon see that this bronze item\u2019s opening was one meter in size. It was a statue of a sheep\u2019s head.\n\nNo, not a single sheep\u2019s head. Each of the object\u2019s four corners held a sheep\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cThis thing\u2026 It looks like a Four Sheep Cube,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself when the bronze item finally slid into full view.\n\nPang!\n\nIt sounded as if something had broken. Although the bronze item had almost completely been removed from the lake, its ascension came to a halt. The Underworld Silk holding the statue had snapped.\n\nHan Sen watched the Four Sheep Cube sink back into the mist of the lake. He didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion or not, but Han Sen could see the four sheep heads seemed to smile strangely at him as the object disappeared.\n\nHan Sen stared at the lake in confusion. The Underworld Silk had broken with ease, which was a first. Han Sen and Bao\u2019er had spent a long time fishing with Underworld Silks, and never before had this happened. Now, the Underworld Silk had simply snapped without them understanding why.\n\nHe wanted to ask Li Keer and Exquisite, but they weren\u2019t present. Han Sen had nothing else to do except continue his mellow fishing experience.\n\n\u201cIt has been a few days. Mister White should have some news for me. I should ask Li Keer to take me to the desert again,\u201d Han Sen said to himself as he continued fishing. He had a simmering sense of excitement regarding the Xuan Yellow Sutra.\n\nHan Sen wouldn\u2019t even have to practice the strange geno art. He only had to reverse his Blood-Pulse Sutra to make use of it. How lucky was he to stumble on such an easy new geno art?\n\n\u201cI hope the Xuan Yellow Sutra is useful,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. But then he suddenly heard Bao\u2019er shouting, \u201cDad, something is coming. Come and help me!\u201d\n\nHan Sen saw Bao\u2019er\u2019s small hand clutching the Underworld Silk. She seemed to be struggling. The Underworld Silk had latched onto something heavy that kept the line taut, just like earlier.\n\nHan Sen raced over to her and grabbed hold of Bao\u2019er\u2019s Underworld Silk to pull the next item up. Whatever he was bringing up now was heavier than the Four Sheep Cube.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er fought against that immense weight. There was a power that was pulling downward, struggling against them. They were on the verge of losing the Underworld Silk or getting pulled into the lake themselves.\n\nThe sixteen little piggies came over, too. They all stood in a line to bite the Underworld Silk. Then they leaned back, pulling it like a big game of tug o\u2019 war.\n\n\u201cPut your back into it, comrades\u2026 One, two, one, two\u2026\u201d Two people and sixteen small piglets were pulling the silk. They all shouted. After half a day, they finally saw something emerge from the lake.\n\nWhen they finally saw it, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cIt is the Four Sheep Cube again!\u201d"
