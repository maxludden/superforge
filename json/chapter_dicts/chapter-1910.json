    "text": "Han Sen found a hidden place in Red Mist Valley. He was going to wait for the spring to burst.\n\nHe also hunted down many of the Viscount creatures that were around, in order to collect their materials and genes.\n\nThere were three or four days left now, according to the schedule Yisha had proposed. And over the course of those next few days, more and more creatures gathered. Han Sen guessed that there had to be around ten thousand in total, with most of them being Viscount. It was fortunate that no creature of a higher tier had come. If they had, Han Sen could not have guaranteed that he would be the one to benefit from the spring.\n\nPerhaps because they were all too greedy in their desire for the spring, many of the creatures fought against each other. He had never seen so much conflict before.\n\nAs Han Sen was watching those xenogeneics fighting outside the valley, he eventually caught sight of a few xenogeneics retreating. They abandoned their position. It seemed as if something strong was coming.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be a higher class xenogeneic, can it?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He looked that way.\n\nBut there were too many xenogeneics there. Many were two meters tall, and they obscured Han Sen\u2019s vision. He couldn\u2019t see whatever was coming.\n\nHan Sen looked around and stayed close to the wall. He wanted to scale it and get a better looked.\n\nThere was a dark green centipede. Each part of its body gleamed with jewel-like eyes as it skittered across the earth. Every xenogeneic in its path backed off as soon as they saw it. None dared to stay within twenty meters of the creature.\n\nThe xenogeneic was ten meters long, but it wasn\u2019t tall. Its body was only half a meter off the ground. That was why Han Sen had such difficulty trying to spot it.\n\nHan Sen watched it for quite some time, and he didn\u2019t think it was all-that high level. It should have been no better than a Viscount, so it was weird to see the fear with which so many xenogeneics regarded it.\n\nQuickly, the centipede xenogeneic reached the entrance of the valley. It was different from the other xenogeneics, and it crawled right into the valley.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Yisha said that the red mist spring was good for xenogeneics. It could speed up their evolution, but the red mist itself was harmful by comparison. Until the spring was ready, the mist remained there. So, it was most wise to avoid the mist until then.\n\nBut the centipede climbed straight into the valley, and it did so without getting harmed by the mist.\n\n\u201cNo! I have got to find that centipede. If it is going towards the spring, it might be able to swallow it the moment it opens up. I\u2019ll lose my own opportunity!\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t thought the centipede was going to climb down into the valley. And now that it was in there, it would be extremely difficult to find the creature. You couldn\u2019t even see your own hand in front of you, that mist was so thick. Trying to find the centipede would be difficult.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to try. Luckily, it is just a Viscount xenogeneic. It cannot be that large of a threat.\u201d Han Sen donned his Marquise armor and the rabbit shoes. He flew past the heads of the xenogeneics and headed straight into the valley.\n\nJust like before, the mist stifled Han Sen\u2019s senses. It was as if he was deaf and blind.\n\nHan Sen searched through the mist, hoping to find the centipede xenogeneic.\n\nThe valley was massive, and there were still a few days to go before the spring was supposed to erupt. Han Sen thought he\u2019d be able to find the centipede.\n\nHan Sen walked more quickly through the mist, but he did not dare go too fast. If he ran into a rock wall and injured himself, he\u2019d become a joke.\n\nDue to him being unable to see, though, he tried hugging the walls as he went. Once he had canvased the area that way, he maintained a steady distance from the wall and went along them again.\n\nAfter searching the place like a neatly-fitted carpet, he hadn\u2019t caught sight of the centipede. Eight hours had elapsed by now.\n\n\u201cThat xenogeneic was rather large. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find. Why am I so unlucky?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed.\n\nHan Sen walked into the deepest recesses of the valley, and when he reached the far wall, he wished to turn back. But that wall felt different from the others.\n\nHan Sen kept running his hands over it, and eventually, he realized there was a space next to it. It was a cave.\n\nHan Sen thought he was adequately protected, with the Marquise armor and the rabbit shoes, so he entered the cave.\n\nAfter entering, Han Sen\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly. The red mist was gone, and he could see all that resided in the cave.\n\nThe red mist was like a fire burning behind him. It lit up the cave. The cave did not have any of the mist inside, though. All of Han Sen\u2019s senses had returned.\n\nHan Sen looked deeper into the cave, and when he did, something made him quite happy. The giant centipede was inside there.\n\n\u201cDoes the spring reside in this cave? No way. Yisha said the spring would have a darker mist. How can there be none at all?\u201d Han Sen thought. He didn\u2019t stop moving, though, and he planned to get rid of the centipede, just in case.\n\nIt looked like that xenogeneic was a very sensitive creature, though. It detected Han Sen\u2019s presence quickly, and so it turned around and used its jewel-like eyes to look at him.\n\nBoom!\n\nAs this occurred, the jewel-like eyes shone with a green light.\n\nThe green light was too bright, especially for a cave that was so small. It blinded the entire cave with that channel of light, prompting Han Sen to run forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky I have this Marquise armor. A light like this looks Viscount level at the lowest,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He drew his Ghost Teeth Knife, and with his ice powers and blood, he cut towards the light.\n\nGhost Teeth Knife sliced through the green light. The light had a tangible presence, and it filled up the entire area. When it landed on Han Sen, he himself turned green.\n\nHan Sen then realized he could no longer move. It was as if he had been stopped by a strange power. He was stuck in the same position, unable to move.\n\n\u201cCrap! There is something wrong with that light.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He hastily used his power, trying to break through the light that was snaring him. He wanted his freedom back.\n\nHan Sen fired up Jadeskin, the Blood-Pulse Sutra, the Dongxuan Sutra, and The Story of Genes, but still, he was unable to escape the green light.\n\nThe centipede-like xenogeneic, with its jewel-like eyes focused on Han Sen, continued to pound him with green light."
