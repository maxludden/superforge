He had shapeshifted to appear just like the Three-Claw Gold Ravens he and Xie Qing King had just done battle with.\n\nAnd indeed, that was the beast soul he had just received\u2014it was a shapeshifting beast soul. It made him resemble the fierce creature he had just triumphed over.\n\nThe moment he transformed, the swords took flight against him. But before they found their target, Han Sen flapped his wings and was suddenly ablaze with the wild dance of searing flames. Without hesitation, he flew forward to meet with the Storm of Swords.\n\nKatcha!\n\nWhen the swords came into contact with the ravenous fires that encompassed Han Sen, they smoldered down to the ground like molten jelly.\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d Han Sen soared through the wall of swords uninhibited, as each sword melted when it entered the proximity of his malevolent fires. Holy-Sword Emperor\u2019s face could not help but droop.\n\nHe could now assess Han Sen\u2019s power, and he could feel the full strength of nine gene locks firing on all cylinders.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Blood-Pulse Sutra had now unlocked its ninth gene lock. Previously, he had been too weak to do so, due to his fitness being too low.\n\nBy using this beast soul, though, it imbued him with the required strength to activate the ninth tier. As a gold bird, he was a raging, avian fiend of nine gene locks.\n\nHan Sen, upon using it now, also noticed his Phoenix Flame and his proficiency with the handling of fire elemental skills were given a buff.\n\nThe gold raven was a creature associated with the element of fire, which was not unlike a phoenix. This beast soul and its shapeshifting ability was a good match for Han Sen, who was skilled in its powers already. There was great synergy involved.\n\nLike a phoenix, he\u2019d be able to fly high and see the breadth of the world.\n\nNo sword could stop Han Sen in this form.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor\u2019s face changed, and he realized a shift in tactics was required. Quickly, he brought the swords to form a cross-hatch net structure to surround him like a bubble. In this way, he removed his foot from Xie Qing King\u2019s face and launched himself towards Han Sen.\n\nThe phoenix became semi-transparent, and as if through magic, breached the veil of swords without receiving a single point of damage.\n\nIn the eye of that hurricane of swords, Han Sen reached out his talons to strike. Holy-Sword Emperor sought to dodge, but he soon realized he\u2019d be unable to do so. Han Sen\u2019s approach was too fast.\n\nPhoenixes were champions of the skies, and there was no possible way for Holy-Sword Emperor to beat such a creature when it came to pure, unbridled speed.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor only had one thing left he could do, and that was to meet Han Sen\u2019s talons with his black sword.\n\nDong!\n\nThe talons collided with the sword. It was Holy-Sword Emperor who was sent flying, with his weapon now enwreathed with a hungry flame. When he landed, he attempted to put out the fire, but there was nothing he could do against that insatiable fire. He could only watch the metal of the blade burn away.\n\nHan Sen was merciless. He let out an ear-piercing screech and resumed his assault on Holy-Sword Emperor.\n\nAs he tried to combat the incoming threat, Holy-Sword Emperor was forced to summon his dual backup-swords.\n\nLike a javelin of wrathful fire, Han Sen accelerated on his approach. Holy-Sword Emperor knew he\u2019d be unable to accurately gauge the correct timing for striking Han Sen with his blistering speed, so he could only flail his swords around like a madman, in the hope he\u2019d get lucky.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Holy-Sword Emperor\u2019s weapons were ablaze with more starved flames. As the blades were ravaged, a number of painful scratch marks suddenly formed across his body and face.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor was delivered another shock. He did his best to avoid the blitzing bird, but he was repeatedly burned and cut.\n\nAs this occurred, Han Sen\u2019s body was gunning at a speed much faster than his mind could keep up with. He himself was in disbelief over the powers he was wielding, and if he didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d believe he was teleporting from place to place with the insane pace he was moving around at.\n\nThe lagging shadow of a phoenix was the only thing that could be seen attacking Holy-Sword Emperor. Over and over, Han Sen ran him through with his talons raised.\n\nAs his weapons became wholly consumed by fire, Holy-Sword Emperor threw them away like a fiery torch that was about to burn his hand. The scratches that accumulated across his body began to itch and burn, and soon after, he himself was set ablaze. With his body on fire, he began crying aloud in agony.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Holy-Sword Emperor managed to sputter, but that was the last thing he could say. He exploded and returned to his spirit stone.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body returned to that of a human. After the battle, he was confident he now had what it took to do battle with any king spirit. With the gold raven beast soul and his ninth gene lock open, he had everything he needed.\n\nXie Qing King looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression. He didn\u2019t know what a human was.\n\n\u201cMy Emperor, allow me to return you to the soothing waters of the lake,\u201d Han Sen said. And then, he proceeded to do just that.\n\nHan Sen was not planning to kill him. He preferred peace to incessant fighting, even with spirits.\n\n\u201cWhat is a human?\u201d Xie Qing King asked, while he was in the lake.\n\nHan Sen explained what humans were and did not hide a thing. It would only be a matter of time until he found out, possibly through the explanation of another spirit, so there was no need for Han Sen to be misleading.\n\nXie Qing King sounded very interested in who they were, and he asked, \u201cThe teleporters in our shelters take you to the Alliance? But why have I never been able to make use of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, either.\u201d Han Sen did not know why spirits and creatures couldn\u2019t use the teleportation devices in the shelters of the sanctuaries.\n\nAfter his explanation, Xie Qing King seemed very interested in learning more about the human world and their many cultures. He asked Han Sen many questions.\n\nAnd to the best of his abilities, Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cMy Emperor, I should go now. It is my hope that, when next we meet, we won\u2019t consider each other enemies.\u201d After bathing together for a few hours, Han Sen said this and prepared to leave.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Xie Qing King said, to stop Han Sen from leaving for a moment.\n\nHan Sen turned around, wondering what else the spirit might want to know.\n\n\u201cLet me come with you. I would like to see for myself what humans are like. I want to see the things you have told me about,\u201d Xie Qing King requested.\n\n\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Han Sen hesitated for a moment, so he could think about how he could best articulate what he wanted to say. Most human technology could not be used or brought to the sanctuaries, after all.\n\nBut if Bao\u2019er was able to enter the world of humans, what was there to say spirits could not?\n\n\u201cYou are a good person, and you are a skilled fighter. But when you fought Holy-Sword Emperor, he was already damaged. That is how you killed him. If he assaults your shelter, with his super creatures in tow, there is no guarantee you can withstand and survive such a conquest.\u201d Xie Qing King squinted."
