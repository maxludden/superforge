This was a unique beast soul, and its description was unlike anything he had ever seen before.\n\nHan Sen summoned it, and it was a scimitar. It seemed like a weapon, forged of black crystals not unlike the original creature\u2019s horns.\n\nWhen Han Sen examined the corpse of the dead king, it started to crumble away and disintegrate into soot. It was soon indistinguishable from the ground of that black land.\n\nThe black crystal horn remained behind though, like a chip of charcoal.\n\nBut when Han Sen touched it, that too crumbled away and scattered like dust.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s body felt extremely weak.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t used the whole hour of super king spirit to defeat the beast, so it wasn\u2019t as bad as last time. But just as Han Sen decided to go looking for Brother Seven, his blurred vision saw someone coming towards him. It was Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself in disappointment.\n\nXie Qing King was headed right for him, and when he arrived before Han Sen, the spirit asked the very same question, but aloud. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI grabbed the person that accompanied Holy-Sword Emperor. He brought me here, but we got split up when encountering a lot of very nasty sheep. I don\u2019t know where he is now.\u201d Han Sen paused for a moment, and then went on to ask, \u201cDid you catch up with Holy-Sword Emperor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He ran off, but not without losing his treasure to me.\u201d Xie Qing King held out an item for Han Sen to take a look at.\n\nIt was a leather scroll, with a gold phoenix painted on it. It looked very alive; like a bird that was truly above and beyond the strength and comprehension of any other bird that existed.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw the picture, he felt as if he had been struck. It reminded him of all the birds he had seen, back in the palace.\n\nThe phoenix on the painting was stood there, delicate and proud. But at the same time, it appeared as if it was flying.\n\n\u201cThis painting is Phoenix Emperor\u2019s treasure; he must have drawn it after seeing all the birds laid out before him in the hall,\u201d Han Sen theorized.\n\nHan Sen thought about the palace, and now, looking at the picture presented, he realized it was the complete set.\n\n\u201cDo you understand?\u201d Xie Qing King asked.\n\n\u201cNo, but that human seems to. If you see him, maybe you can ask him?\u201d Han Sen was worried Xie Qing King might mercilessly strike down Brother Seven if he encountered him.\n\nXie Qing King put the picture away. He then picked up Han Sen and started flying.\n\nHan Sen knew he meant no harm, so he didn\u2019t try to resist the free lift.\n\nXie Qing King flew at an obscene speed, and it seemed as if they traveled thousands of miles in no time at all. They came to a stop near a lake.\n\n\u201cMy Emperor, where is this?\u201d Han Sen asked, as he observed the lake.\n\n\u201cIs this where the treasure resides?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nXie Qing King did not answer, and instead, chucked Han Sen directly into the water. Then, he himself jumped in. It was as if they were going to have a bath together.\n\nHan Sen believed there to be something strange about the lake, but when Xie Qing King jumped in, he felt safer.\n\nHan Sen felt as if all his dirt was being cleansed and rinsed away. His Dongxuan Aura seemed to be recovering, too.\n\nBao\u2019er was also there, and she merrily swam and splashed about in the waters of the lake.\n\n\u201cEmperor, this lake is fairly fancy!\u201d Han Sen feigned surprise.\n\nXie Qing King replied, \u201cOf course it is. This lake is composed of the tears of the fiery phoenix. The water is restorative to one\u2019s body.\u201d\n\n\u201cTears of a phoenix, you say?\u201d Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King in awe.\n\nXie Qing King, without beating around the bush, said, \u201cDo you know why that turkey called himself Phoenix Emperor? It was because he grew a holy tree. That tree gave birth to a pair of fruit. In each fruit was a phoenix with ten gene locks open. When they went to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, however, the male died. That\u2019s why this place was ruined. The tears of the other phoenix, in the loss of its partner, is what formed this lake. By bathing here, we can rinse ourselves of any debilitations we may have incurred.\u201d After a brief moment of silence, Xie Qing King went on to say, \u201cI went to the treasury but there was nothing there. I think the turkey must have hidden his treasure somewhere in this place. We should resume our search later.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought of the giant tree he had stepped into before entering the shelter, and asked himself, \u201cWas that the holy tree he talked about?\u201d He then went on to think, \u201cHmm, remember that etching near the entrance? Didn\u2019t it say, \u2018The phoenix descended on God Mountain and the emperor died\u2019? By descent, does it mean the phoenix died and fell to the ground? And the emperor died with it? Is the emperor dead someplace here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be here for another seven hours. It looks like you were injured pretty badly, following your wrestling match with the sheep. Stay here and you\u2019ll be right as rain before you know it,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t known when it occurred, but Bao\u2019er had climbed on top of Xie Qing King\u2019s head. Needless to say, he was surprised and a little fearful.\n\nBut it was unjustified, because Xie Qing King did not mind at all. He was fine with the baby there, and he was not angry or annoyed. He simply allowed Bao\u2019er to pull his hair and squeeze his cheeks.\n\nHan Sen wanted to call her back, in case she made him mad. But all of a sudden, he felt something touch his waist. It gave him quite the shock."
