    "text": "Han Sen used his power to restrict the Demon Abyss Beast King, but his arrows didn\u2019t seem to inflict any damage on the creature. Black holes appeared and vanished all across the Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s body. Whenever an arrow came close, it would be sucked into one of those black pits, keeping the damage from reaching the Demon Abyss Beast King. This was all within what Han Sen had expected, though. The Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s power and capabilities had been detailed in the information he had been given. Han Sen never expected his arrows to be able to damage the Demon Abyss Beast King. He was simply buying enough time to get closer to the creature.\n\nFinally, Han Sen got close enough to the Demon Abyss Beast King. Han Sen spun his Six Core Snake Bow and used it like a knife. The razor-sharp string sliced into the Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s scales, leaving deep wounds across its flesh.\n\n\u201cJust as the file said. The Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s Demon Abyss power can consume energy, but it cannot turn away physical damage.\u201d Han Sen felt calm.\n\nThe Demon Abyss Beast King became very angry after being struck. Its blue light raged with greater ferocity.\n\nBut Han Sen attacked again and again with the Six Core Snake Bow, flitting around the Demon Abyss Beast King like a mosquito buzzing around a magnificent beast. No matter how loudly the Demon Abyss Beast King roared, it couldn\u2019t hit Han Sen. It then activated an area attack, but the fortitude of Han Sen\u2019s peacock king\u2019s soul robe was enough to shrug off all the damage. The Demon Abyss Beast King couldn\u2019t do anything against him.\n\nYu Kun stood to the side, doing absolutely nothing at all. He only restricted the Demon Abyss Beast King a little bit. Han Sen continued fighting at close range, and the Demon Abyss Beast King was being dealt more and more wounds.\n\n\u201cWhat a scary guy. This moveset and those knifeskills resemble Sky Palace\u2019s Under the Sky. But who in our race ever practiced Under the Sky to such a level of proficiency?\u201d Shiya asked with shock.\n\nZuo Yu was recording the fight between Han Sen and the Demon Abyss Beast King. And as he continued to record it, he said, \u201cUnder the Sky hasn\u2019t been complete for long. Not many students have practiced it, no. But there will eventually be more. This will be perfect learning material.\u201d\n\nShiya shook her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you can just watch and learn. You need to know how to use it, and executing a skill like this would be much harder than analyzing it. To be straight with you, only practitioners who have already mastered the skill could benefit from watching this. Most students wouldn\u2019t stand any chance of becoming as skilled as Han Sen, no matter how many times they watched this video. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a fluke that the Very High test ranked him as an eleven armor talent.\u201d\n\nZuo Yu laughed and said, \u201cWell, having this video will be better than nothing! I hope the Sky can develop a few elites like Han Sen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to doubt Han Sen\u2019s capabilities any longer. A ninth-tier King is killing the Demon Abyss Beast King. Although he does use two powerful treasures, Han Sen is definitely scary. If he is a spy, he is a great danger to Sky Palace. But right now, we still don\u2019t know where he came from,\u201d Shiya said.\n\n\u201cIf he isn\u2019t a spy, then we have gotten very lucky. This is our department\u2019s responsibility. We must confirm his identity and political alignments,\u201d Zuo Yu said.\n\n\u201cThat is true, but the civilization of the crystallizers is long gone. The few that remain are vagrant, interstellar travelers. We have been looking into Han Sen\u2019s past for some time, but after finding the Kate, we lost the trail. Plus, the Kate\u2019s planet has been ravaged by war in recent years. Many of the Kate people have lost their homes. There won\u2019t be much left for us to learn,\u201d Shiya said.\n\n\u201cBut we still have to do it. This investigation is our responsibility, and the leader takes Han Sen very seriously. So, we have to find out. With his reputation, his influence within Sky Palace will continue to grow,\u201d Zuo Yu said as he watched the Demon Abyss Beast King battle Han Sen. The man\u2019s expression was grave.\n\nA sad wail rocked the whole of the Demon Abyss. The Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s head was chopped off by the Six Core Snake Bow. Demon blood cascaded down like rain.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic deified hunted: Demon Abyss Beast King. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d As this happened, an announcement sounded inside Han Sen\u2019s head. When he heard no mention of a beast soul, he looked disappointed. Yu Kun began hauling the Demon Abyss Beast King\u2019s body out of Demon Abyss. He couldn\u2019t hide it from the Sky Palace students. They could guess that Han Sen and Yu Kun had killed the Demon Abyss Beast King together.\n\nAs everyone discussed Han Sen killing the deified xenogeneic, a student found a video showing Han Sen\u2019s performance in killing the Demon Abyss Beast King. That video was quickly distributed all around Sky Palace.\n\n\u201cBrother Han is using Under the Sky. That belongs to the Sky, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the Sky can be that powerful?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it is strong. I heard Brother Han actually contributed to its modifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like I should start learning Under the Sky, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we should. When Brother Han gets back to teaching, we should ask him.\u201d\n\nMany of the students in Sky Palace started to discuss Han Sen\u2019s use of Under the Sky, but after Han Sen saw the video himself, he could only frown.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Sky Palace sent someone to watch me. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way someone could have filmed a video like that while we were fighting,\u201d Han Sen said. Han Sen kept thinking. He decided to agree to Sky Palace Leader\u2019s request that he join the Very High for four years. When he returned, he would be given the Constellation Sea all for himself.\n\nWhen Sky Palace Leader heard Han Sen\u2019s decision, he didn\u2019t sound happy. He said grimly, \u201cIf you want to go, there is something annoying you must do before your departure. You cannot leave, otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat annoying thing?\u201d Han Sen frowned. He had thought that making the decision would be the difficult part. What had gone wrong now?\n\nSky Palace Leader squinted his eyes and said, \u201cExquisite wanted you to go, but you beat her and made her give up all hope. If you want to go, you need to make Exquisite select you once more. You will have to clean up this mess yourself.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mouth hung open. After a while, he said, \u201cWhat is this? If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have beaten her so badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so depressed. Beating her might not have been a bad thing. At least now she will look at you differently. And that means she will hold you in higher esteem. This way, you will have more freedom,\u201d Sky Palace Leader said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you send someone to apologize on my behalf?\u201d Han Sen asked, trying not to cringe. He had beaten her badly and forced her to face painful realizations, all because he didn\u2019t want to go. Now he had changed his mind. After Han Sen thought about it some more, he realized he might have been a bit of a cretin.\n\n\u201cYou are the one who beat her. It is now up to you to change her mind again. Otherwise, even if you somehow reached the Very High on your own, only trouble would await you. Why not get it sorted before you go?\u201d Sky Palace Leader patted him on the shoulder and went on to say, \u201cDon\u2019t mess this up. I have faith in you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen had no idea how to deal with this situation, but he wanted the Constellation Sea. He had to do what Sky Palace Leader was telling him to."
