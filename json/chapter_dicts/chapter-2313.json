    "text": "Han Sen\u2019s eyes flashed like lightning as he turned to face the thing coming out of the sand.\n\nIt was a humanoid form made of rock. It rose and immediately smashed a fist of stone down toward Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen quickly retreated so that the rockman\u2019s fist hit the sand. The sand shot out in a miniature shockwave around the creature\u2019s fist.\n\nStone was clearly its element, so the creature would have difficulty casting power outside of its body. However, the creature was quite adept at using its power to reinforce itself, so its physical strength was extremely impressive.\n\nAs the rockman swung at him again, Han Sen deployed his Jadeskin Battle Body. Then, he threw a punch to meet the rockman\u2019s own.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s jade fist came against the rockman\u2019s stony knuckles, which released the sharp cracking noise of stone hitting stone. The rockman\u2019s giant fist and arm were shattered by Han Sen\u2019s punch, scattering broken chunks of rock across the sand around them.\n\nHan Sen quickly followed up his punch, hitting the rockman repeatedly. After a few blows, the rockman\u2019s body had become nothing but rubble on the dunes.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke hunted. Rock Demon: xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t obtain a new beast soul, but that didn\u2019t bother him. He rummaged through the rubble of his fallen foe until he unearthed a mud-colored crystal.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke Rock Demon gene obtained.\u201d\n\nHan Sen picked up the crystal and resumed walking through the desert. Now that Jadeskin had its first gene lock open, he could borrow power from the planet itself. The ability was proving to be quite useful. He stood on Planet King Kong and recovered the energy he had spent when he took down the Rock Demon.\n\nHan Sen walked one hundred miles, and during that entire time, he only encountered two Rock Demons. Xenogeneics were annoyingly rare on the planet, but because of that, there was little in the way of risk. It would just take longer for Han Sen to collect what he needed.\n\nHan Sen could fly very quickly, so he took to the air to speed things up a bit. He traveled across the desert until he saw a black fog choking an area in front of him.\n\nHan Sen thought it might be a sandstorm or a gathering of dark clouds, but there was something about it that didn\u2019t feel right. The planet\u2019s atmosphere was too thin to form real clouds or sandstorms.\n\nThe black fog came closer, and Han Sen realized that instead of being composed of sand, it was actually a vast cloud of stoneflies.\n\nThe stoneflies looked almost exactly like ordinary flies, but their bodies were composed of black stone. They were a common low-level xenogeneic that was commonly known to reside on Planet King Kong. They were the only xenogeneics on the planet that could attack in a group.\n\nDong dong\u2026 dong dong\u2026\n\nKilling them was pointless. Most of the stoneflies were Barons, and it was very rare to find one that was even a Viscount. None of the Royal Guards cared about stone fly xenogeneic genes.\n\nAs the stoneflies came closer, Han Sen heard a weird noise coming from their midst. It sounded as if there was something larger hovering in the middle of the dark cyclone of insects.\n\nThere were so many of the stoneflies that they hung over the ground like a black cloud. As a result, Han Sen couldn\u2019t see what lay within.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly amazing number of stoneflies. It isn\u2019t common to see this many of them, according to the chronicled history of Planet King Kong. Why are they here? What drew them here?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nHan Sen was wearing his Galactic Lobster Armor, which would protect him from even King class creatures. Han Sen wasn\u2019t worried about the insects in front of him, so he walked right into the hordes of stoneflies. He wanted to see what he would find in the middle.\n\nEven if there was a King class xenogeneic, Han Sen would be able to battle it within the dark cloud. If he could kill a King class xenogeneic, its xenogeneic gene would be a great reward for him, as well.\n\nThe number of stoneflies within the swarm was truly mind-boggling. Han Sen strode through the swarm, and it sounded like a rainstorm as the stoneflies pelted his armor.\n\nThe stoneflies weren\u2019t trying to attack him, though. There were simply so many of them that they flew into Han Sen\u2019s armor by mistake.\n\nHan Sen made his way through the stoneflies, and after a while, he saw a blurry shadow in front of him. The closer he got to the shadow, the more stoneflies there were. The shadow soon resolved into a beast with four legs. It looked kind of like a tiger or a lion.\n\nBut that shadow was so obscured by the stoneflies that Han Sen couldn\u2019t see even an inch of its skin. Other than a rough outline, the creature\u2019s form was hidden. Han Sen could only tell that it was twenty meters tall and thirty meters long.\n\nThe xenogeneic was now approaching under the blanketing stoneflies. The stoneflies raced furiously around it. The xenogeneic passed close by Han Sen, but it continued to walk without showing any sign of wanting to attack him.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He moved his leg and a Petrify shockwave spread out around him. Although stone element xenogeneics had a strong resistance to the powers of petrification, the stoneflies were simply too low-level to withstand his attack.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Petrify shockwave spread out, petrifying many of the stoneflies on contact. They fell down from the sky.\n\nThe stoneflies upon the xenogeneic also became petrified, and they began to fall to the ground one by one. As that creature continued to walk, its real face became visible.\n\nIt was a wolf made of blue metal, but for some reason, it had been sorely injured. Blood coated the creature\u2019s entire body.\n\nThe stoneflies had swarmed around the wolf, trying to dine on the blue blood that was oozing freely out of its body.\n\nBlergh!\n\nThe blue metal wolf suddenly coughed twice. It continued to hack as it moved forward, strings of blood hanging from its mouth. Many of the stoneflies buzzed down around its head, clearly drawn by the blue blood that was now staining the sand.\n\nHan Sen sent out another wave of petrification, but the hordes of stoneflies stretched far beyond the reach of the attack. Seconds later, they had descended to cover up the blue metal wolf\u2019s body once more.\n\nThe blue metal wolf barely seemed to notice the stoneflies. It only continued to walk without rest. Every step it took left a giant pawprint in the sand.\n\n\u201cI am way too lucky. I\u2019ve met an injured King class xenogeneic. It might even be half-deified.\u201d Han Sen was so happy. The blue metal wolf looked badly wounded, and Han Sen believed that it was weak enough to be killed easily. He drew out his Thunder God Spike and Ghost Teeth Knife. He was going to strike at the injured metal wolf.\n\nJust as Han Sen was about to attack, he heard a scream from the sky.\n\nThat scary scream was like a shockwave spreading out from some point above him. Countless stoneflies exploded under the pressure of that fierce scream. In moments, the hordes of insects that had covered the entire sky were reduced to nothing but a whiff of dust.\n\nHan Sen\u2019seyes widened. A stone dragon soared across the sky, flapping its wings. It swooped down from the sky, extending sharp claws toward the injured metal wolf.\n\nThe stone dragon\u2019s body looked like black jade. Its wings cut the air like sharp stone blades, and they glittered with a fractallic light. It was a strange sight.\n\n\u201cA King class stone xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen frowned as he gripped his weapons tighter. He stared at the giant metal wolf and readied himself to fight. \u201cTrying to steal stuff from me, huh? I\u2019ll tell you right now that you don\u2019t have what it takes."
