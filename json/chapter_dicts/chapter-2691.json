    "text": "\u201cThat should be more than enough, I should think,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod. He was still thinking about the fight he had just endured against that xenogeneic.\n\nHan Sen thought his fighting power was decent at this point, but that xenogeneic had completely suppressed him in every way imaginable. Aside from the power gap between them, there were also important differences in the ways that the two of them fought.\n\nNow that he thought about it some more, he realized he had been completely suppressed. He had lost in the most embarrassing way possible.\n\n\u201cIt was just a doppelganger, and yet, it had such a scary amount of power. I wonder how strong its true self is, then?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer looked at each other. They had played Han Sen perfectly, and now they could barely suppress their laughter.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know that the doppelganger he battled was different from most other doppelgangers. It was kind of like a child of the true god xenogeneic. Although its power was indeed primitive class, the battle experience it possessed\u2014and its skill and will\u2014were top-notch. Han Sen was the only person who would struggle to defeat such a beast; even most deifieds would lose badly against this opponent.\n\n\u201cLet him lose a few more times against it. Let\u2019s wear him down a bit,\u201d Li Keer smiled and thought to herself.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s wounds recovered quickly. To aid his self-recovery power, Li Keer and Exquisite provided him with a geno fluid produced from xenogeneic genes. It was very good for healing one\u2019s physical wounds. With the combination of those two powers, every speck of damage had disappeared within seven or eight hours.\n\nOver the next few days, Han Sen went to the Jail Demon Hall to do battle against the xenogeneic. He came up with many different plans to bring the creature down, but every attempt was useless.\n\nThe longest Han Sen was able to last inside was two minutes. Once he was done, he had to teleport away. If he hadn\u2019t, he would have been killed.\n\nHe would only be given a sliver of time to cast his knife airs. Even when he used Under the Sky, it seemed to do nothing to the xenogeneic. Not only did he fail to kill it, but he couldn\u2019t inflict a single wound on his foe.\n\n\u201cIt really is too strong.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but compliment how frighteningly powerful his latest xenogeneic opponent really was. But despite his repeated defeats, he never thought about giving up. As soon as his body recovered, he went back to the Jail Demon Hall to fight. He was determined to find a way to kill it.\n\nBut every time he went there, he would leave disappointed. The xenogeneic was too strong to be predictable, and so Han Sen couldn\u2019t figure out the creature\u2019s patterns and use those to manipulate it, either.\n\nThe more Han Sen went, the more Li Keer and Exquisite started to worry. They had only wanted to get rid of some of Han Sen\u2019s pride. They wanted to use that xenogeneic to wear down his resolve.\n\nBut if he kept going on like this, and he eventually broke down completely, they would have a destroyed silkworm on their hands.\n\nFortunately, they hadn\u2019t sensed any sign that Han Sen was about to give up. Although he kept losing, after each failure, he would just start thinking about how he might defeat the beast the next time he did battle. His entire mind seemed devoted to coming up with ways to defeat the fiend. He never wasted brain power on thinking about anything else.\n\nThat made Exquisite and Li Keer feel a little safer with what they were doing. They just hoped that the time limit would pass soon. Then, Han Sen would have no choice but to give up. It wouldn\u2019t destroy too much of his confidence, they predicted.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 that still won\u2019t work.\u201d Han Sen failed again. He dragged his body, which was riddled with slashes and puncture wounds, out of the Jail Demon Hall. He shook his head.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer weren\u2019t there. Because Han Sen now spent his entire days either fighting or healing, they stopped hanging around after the first few days. It was dull. They would occasionally come back to feel how Han Sen felt during the fight, but not all of the time.\n\nAlso, due to the fact that Han Sen kept losing, they were only learning how to deal with failure. That didn\u2019t help them much. Because there wasn\u2019t much else for them to learn, they stopped focusing on his thoughts as much.\n\n\u201cIt looks like taking down that xenogeneic won\u2019t be easy. Hey wait, it\u2019s almost time to meet up with Mister White! I need to go to the core area.\u201d Han Sen thought about the Xuan Yellow Sutra, and he realized it was time for him to take a break from fighting.\n\nWhen he saw Li Keer again, Han Sen mentioned his need to visit the core area again. Li Keer hastily agreed to his request.\n\nShe and Exquisite had grown worried about Han Sen\u2019s constant fighting in the Jail Demon Hall. They were worried that being defeated endlessly might do too much damage to his confidence. Now that Han Sen had expressed a desire to go to the core area, they thought it was a best-case scenario.\n\nLi Keer took Han Sen back to the oasis so he could enter the core area.\n\nOf course, Gu Qingcheng was there at the place they were supposed to meet. When he saw Gu Qingcheng there, Han Sen couldn\u2019t wait to ask, \u201cOkay, what did you learn? Did you receive news from Mister White?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what Mister White asked me to give you.\u201d Gu Qingcheng passed a notebook to Han Sen, alongside the original version of the Xuan Yellow Sutra.\n\nHan Sen accepted them and put away the Xuan Yellow Sutra. He opened up the notebook to have a look. The pages were filled with an elegant script, which had clearly been written by hand. The notebook had a hundred pages, and almost all of them contained notes. There were only two or three pages that were empty. Clearly, Mister White had put a lot of effort into this.\n\n\u201cMister White really is so nice.\u201d There weren\u2019t many people who were as kind as Mister White, Han Sen decided. He was the sort of person who did impressive things and achieved a lot. He was no common man.\n\nInstead of leaving the core area, Han Sen remained there to read Mister White\u2019s notebook. He didn\u2019t want Li Keer and Exquisite looking over his shoulder as he studied, metaphorically speaking.\n\nThe content of the notebook was a detailed analysis of the Xuan Yellow Sutra. It also had notes on the problems it might cause and the aftermath of using it.\n\nAs Han Sen read through the content of the notebook, he learned a great deal. And not just about the Xuan Yellow Sutra, either. He began to understand the Dongxuan Sutra and the Blood-Pulse Sutra to a higher level.\n\n\u201cMister White is a real grandmaster. Compared to him, I am just a peasant with some good luck and a bit of motivation,\u201d Han Sen murmured, shaking his head as he closed the notebook.\n\nActually, Han Sen\u2019s compliment wasn\u2019t strictly accurate. Everyone\u2019s path to study was different. Mister White had focused on acquiring knowledge. He knew so much, which put him on a higher plane than Han Sen when it came to intellectual pursuits. But then again, Han Sen wasn\u2019t the sort of person who focused on amassing huge amounts of knowledge, so it wasn\u2019t strange that Mister White outmatched him in that area. Comparing the two men in such a singular way wasn\u2019t very fair.\n\nHan Sen memorized everything that was written in the notebook, but he didn\u2019t want to destroy it. After all, Mister White put in the time and effort to write it all out by hand.\n\n\u201cTake this back to Planet Eclipse and ask Zero to hide it.\u201d Han Sen gave the notebook to Gu Qingcheng so she could take it back.\n\nAfter Gu Qingcheng left, Han Sen tried to digest the content of the notebook. The more he thought about it, the more shaken he felt. Based on what Mister White had described, if Han Sen finished practicing the Xuan Yellow Sutra, it would become a very scary power.\n\n\u201cIs it really possible to reverse Blood-Pulse?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. If what Mister White told him about the Xuan Yellow Sutra was accurate, it was terrifying."
