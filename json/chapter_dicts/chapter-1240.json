Very good! If you become a part of me, I will obtain your powers, too.\u201d Saint Fan was talking like a madman.\n\nSaint Fan was able to heal himself, but not anyone else. That was why he valued the rhino so much. They were both of a holy element, but if Saint Fan combined with the rhino, he could not use it to heal others.\n\nThe silver fox\u2019s ability of healing was of a different element, and if Saint Fan consumed Little Silver, he could overcome this hurdle.\n\nSaint Fan had a wide array of wretched powers bubbling within him, and he used it all to fight back the silver lightning. But with his strength starting to prove itself supreme, Little Silver began to struggle, and Saint Fan was inching closer and closer to the furry fighter.\n\nThe silver fox did all he could to strengthen his thunder, but nothing he did could prohibit the lurching approach of Saint Fan.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something! We can\u2019t just let him bully that fox!\u201d Xie Qing King exclaimed.\n\nUnfortunately, there was nothing they could realistically do. Nothing they could do worked on Saint Fan, and the last thing they wanted was to become glued to him.\n\nHan Sen saw something weird about Saint Fan, but he wasn\u2019t sure what it was.\n\nSeeing Saint Fan get closer to the silver fox, though, Han Sen still did not activate his super king spirit mode to help.\n\nBoom! Boom!\n\nSaint Fan\u2019s hideous body, if it could even be called that, was sickening to see. It resembled little more than a hulking biomass, whose footsteps rocked the earth with each step.\n\nHalf an hour later, Saint Fan had managed to come directly before the silver fox. With one of the snakes that protruded from his body, he tried to snatch the silver fox.\n\n\u201cLittle Silver, come back!\u201d Han Sen shouted.\n\nThe silver fox heard Han Sen\u2019s command, and then suddenly its size shrank. It leaped onto Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, taking back its rightful spot where his master had severely missed him.\n\nSaint Fan turned around to look at Han Sen and his companions. Many of the mouths across his body opened to say, \u201cGood; you\u2019ve all lined up to offer yourselves up for my consumption. You must earnestly wish me to become a demi-god, but be good and queue up single-file, would you?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Saint Fan began his approach towards them all. It was a terrifying thing to behold.\n\nSnowball turned into a ball and ran off, but he wasn\u2019t the only one. They all fell back together, acknowledging their foe was now far too strong.\n\n\u201cSaint Fan Emperor, before you try and consume us all, can I ask you two questions?\u201d Han Sen did not wait for a response, and he immediately asked, \u201cHow did you return to the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary for the rhino?\u201d\n\nAll the mouths on Saint Fan opened to answer, \u201cThat is the ability of an emperor shelter. They all have different abilities, and mine provided this one. When triggered, you can open a gate that leads you to the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary. I did not break through space, and it was the rhino who opened the gate. That gate led to an emperor shelter, which just so happened to be mine.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was disappointed with this answer. He thought he could move his mother and Yanran to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary with safety.\n\n\u201cSecond question; why do you attack us? I fail to believe all this is purely in the desire for revenge,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI do not need to explain anything to you,\u201d Saint Fan said, preparing to absorb him.\n\n\u201cIt is because of that tree, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nSaint Fan asked, \u201cYou saw it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I did. I saw three fruits upon its branches. One of the fruits contained a Twin Knight,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\nSaint Fan looked surprised, and he asked, \u201cHas it matured yet?\u201d\n\nNow Han Sen understood Saint Fan\u2019s rush to do battle was not for revenge, but for the tree that resided in Thunder Hell Shelter. Han Sen also knew now that it was a Three-Life Tree. He did not know what the other fruits were, though.\n\n\u201cDo you know what the other two fruits are that grow on the Three-Life Tree?\u201d Han Sen asked, but he was ignored. Saint Fan simply moved forward and tried to attack.\n\nThe silver fox used lightning to break the power it had expelled towards Han Sen.\n\nBut Saint Fan had grown incredibly strong, and although the attack had been stayed, the malformed spirit himself could not be stopped. His approach continued.\n\nFor some reason, his powers felt unlimited. But also, weaker.\n\nHan Sen flapped his wings and dodged another attack. He stood in front of the hideous body and said, \u201cLook at yourself, before trying to kill us!\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, what game are you trying to play now?\u201d Saint Fan said. He knew the extent of his powers and knew how wretched he actually appeared, but he just continued trying to attack.\n\n\u201cLook at yourself! Look at your body! Are you afraid I will assault you?\u201d Han Sen asked, evading the strike.\n\nSaint Fan was not afraid of any possible assault Han Sen could muster, and he had more than one pair of eyes now. He took control of the snake and led it out to get a better view of himself, but what he saw shocked him. He said, \u201cImpossible!\u201d"
