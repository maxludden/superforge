    "text": "Han Sen was shocked. Han Jinzhi had him seek out Han Yufei, but Han Yufei did not know who Han Jinzhi was. That was quite a weird twist. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a Han Jinzhi? He is an old man, and something of a fortune teller. He has double-eyelids above long and narrow eyes.\u201d Han Sen described Han Jinzhi\u2019s appearance. Han Yufei shook her head. \u201cYou know that I was trapped in Two Worlds Mountain. Unless he is someone from Sacred era, how am I supposed to know who he is?\u201d.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He thought, \u201cYes. Han Jinzhi is not so old. He might be old for humans, but before someone like Han Yufei, he is less than a few years old. How could he know who Han Yufei was?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on in first.\u201d Han Yufei turned around and went into the laboratory.\n\nHan Sen said his greetings, and Dragon Lady followed. The snow fairy shut the door behind them.\n\nThat icy bunker-slash-laboratory was full of ice. The temperature was low. Han Sen saw drawers and cans made of ice. Through the half-transparent ice, some weird stuff was visible inside them. There were organs of creatures, some colorful liquids, and some large ice cupboards with entire xenogeneics in them.\n\n\u201cTake a seat.\u201d They entered a room that looked somewhat like a lounge. Han Yufei sat on an ice chair. She looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cDid you say that guy Han Jinzhi told you to find me here? How does he know I am here? How does he even know my name?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me to come and look for you here but said nothing else. I thought you might be close to him,\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. It seemed as if he had been tricked by Han Jinzhi.\n\n\u201cI can tell you with complete certainty that I have never heard this name before. I do not know this person.\u201d Han Yufei was silent a moment and then asked, \u201cWhy did he tell you to come and look for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy body has blue blood. I thought you would know that already.\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cBlue blood? What blue blood?\u201d Han Yufei frowned.\n\n\u201cDid you not see what happened in the god palaces?\u201d Han Sen asked with shock.\n\n\u201cI have so much research to do, so I have no time to watch such things,\u201d Han Yufei said.\n\nHan Sen told her about Human King dribbling all the blue blood on him. After Han Yufei heard his tale, her face changed. She grabbed Han Sen\u2019s hand. Before Han Sen could react, she pulled a needle out of nowhere and thrust it into one of his fingers. She drew some of his blood.\n\nBefore he said anything, Han Yufei ran out of the lounge. She went into a laboratory, which had all kinds of tools.\n\nDragon Lady and Han Sen wanted to enter, but Han Yufei did not even look at them as she said, \u201cStand outside and do not come in.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew that normal people should not enter a laboratory. If they fiddled with some tool and messed up a test, that would be bad. So, he just waited outside.\n\nFortunately, the laboratory wall was made of ice. It was crystal clear, so they could see what was going on inside.\n\nHan Yufei used all kinds of tools and tubes to research the blue blood. After an hour, she came out of the laboratory.\n\n\u201cNot bad. The blood inside your body is Sacred blood.\u201d Han Yufei was checking Han Sen out. She went on to say, \u201cSo, your body already has Sacred Leader\u2019s genes. Otherwise, you would not be able to combine with that blue blood. As for that guy who gave you the blue blood, where did he get Sacred Leader\u2019s blood from? The amount of it is almost like Sacred Leader himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould that person be Sacred Leader?\u201d Han Sen always wondered if Human King and Qin Xiu were the same person.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Han Yufei said with confidence.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Han Sen did not know why Han Yufei was so sure about that.\n\n\u201cFollow me. I need to give you a full-body check.\u201d Han Yufei led Han Sen to another laboratory. She said, \u201cSacred Leader\u2019s blood is different from ordinary blood. If the guy you told me about was the real Sacred Leader, then he could not have spoken to you face-to-face.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was confused, so he asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\nHan Yufei kept walking and said, \u201cYou should have heard about Sacred Leader wearing armor at all times. No one has seen his face. Isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Han Sen had heard about that before. Since he had met Qin Xiu\u2019s soul and saw his statue, he had not thought it was a big deal.\n\nHan Yufei said, \u201cSacred Leader wore armor because his body was special. If he did not wear armor, his body would have had a big problem. Let\u2019s not say he cut his hands and gave you blue blood, as Sacred Leader would never have exposed his hands outside of his armor. So, the guy who gave you blue blood must not have been Sacred Leader.\u201d\n\nWhile they were talking, Han Sen was led into another laboratory by Han Yufei. This laboratory was different from the last one. This laboratory had been constructed with impressive technology, and the temperature was not quite as low.\n\nHan Sen entered a chamber. Han Yufei started the tool that would enable a full scan of Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nAs Han Sen was lying in the chamber, he asked, \u201cWas Sacred Leader\u2019s body sick? Why would he have problems if he did not wear armor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should feel it, right?\u201d Han Yufei asked. \u201cWhen your blood turned into blue blood, you were cut off from all the rules and powers of the universe.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded and confirmed. He did not just feel it. It was very strong.\n\n\u201cSacred Leader himself did not just create a barrier. Without the protection of the armor, his body would have been destroyed by the ruling powers of the universe. He would have had to fight against the whole universe. You know the ending.\u201d Han Yufei kept using her tools as she spoke.\n\nWhen Han Sen heard that, his heart jumped. \u201cThat sounds so familiar. It sounds like in the sanctuaries. When you level up to a higher sanctuary, the higher-level sanctuaries rules would destroy you.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei looked at the data on the monitor and frowned as she said, \u201cWeird\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is weird?\u201d Han Sen asked. \u201cAside from the blue blood genes inside your body, there is another gene,\u201d Han Yufei quietly said. \u201cThat gene is very close to the blue blood genes, but it cannot combine with the blue blood. It is because of that gene you did not become completely blue blood.\u201d \u201cThat should be the Nine-Life Cat tattoo.\u201d Han Sen told her about the Nine-Life Cat tattoo. Now, Han Sen was starting to believe what Han Jinzhi had told him. It looked like Han Yufei would be the one to sort out his current problems. At least, Han Yufei understood blue blood.\n\nHan Yufei looked at the data on the monitor and spoke to herself. \u201cNine-Life Cat genes, huh? That should be impossible, unless\u2026\u201d She suddenly thought of something. She quickly controlled the tool and rescanned Han Sen\u2019s body."
