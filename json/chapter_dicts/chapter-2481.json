    "text": "\u201cIf he\u2019s the master of all celestial beings, then I\u2019m the daddy of all gods,\u201d said a King class elite with a tremendous belly-laugh.\n\nMany other elites were saying similar things. They enjoyed mocking others, and with what was happening on the video stream, it was too easy. It was like two crazy people putting on a comedy skit.\n\nBut in the next second, their smiles froze. A red light appeared in Han Sen\u2019s hand, and that light looked like the seed of fire itself. The red glow immediately lit up Lando\u2019s body, and his entire form burst to life with wild red flames.\n\nAt the same time this happened, a scary presence appeared. It exploded out of Lando\u2019s body like an erupting volcano.\n\nIn seconds, Lando\u2019s injured body recovered. The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo on his back, which had just now looked dim and lifeless, was now bursting with a purple light. A purple dragon\u2019s shadow came to life on Lando\u2019s back, and it looked even shinier than when Lando had used his powers earlier.\n\nAll of the stream\u2019s viewers stared at their screens, motionless. No one was quite sure what had happened, but Dragon One\u2019s eyes opened wide. He could barely believe what he was seeing.\n\nThere were two scars on Lando\u2019s back. They were the wounds he incurred when his wings were ripped off. The legends said he was cursed when his teacher tore them off and that they would never grow back.\n\nBut at that moment, bones sprouted from his back and flesh crawled over them, creating new purple dragon wings. As the wings grew from Lando\u2019s back, the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo grew wings as well.\n\nPreviously, the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo had only been half-finished. Now, however, Dragon One sensed that there were no longer any flaws to the tattoo\u2019s composition. The presence that radiated from Lando was enough to make people tremble. Seeing a deified treasure of this power was very, very rare.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 this is impossible! The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo is finished\u2026\u201d Dragon One was shocked. He stared at Lando with wide eyes.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t really looking at Lando. He wasn\u2019t looking at the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo, either. He was looking at Han Sen, who had his hand on Lando\u2019s forehead like some kind of ancient progenitor of gods.\n\nIn truth, everyone tuned into the broadcast was looking at Han Sen in utter shock. Even if they didn\u2019t know enough to recognize the changes to the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo, they could feel that Lando was changing into something grander. The geno universe was frozen as all the creatures watched the stream in shock.\n\nAt this moment, those two figures were at the center of the entire universe. One of them was releasing a scary presence, and the other one was like the father of all gods. He stood over Lando like some holy deity, giving his believer a blessing.\n\nHan Sen felt so happy about this. He wasn\u2019t some sort of god, and he didn\u2019t have a holy power to imbue Lando with.\n\nHe was just using the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s area.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t been sure what to do with it before. He didn\u2019t know why the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s area couldn\u2019t trigger the movement of any other universal cogwheels. When he touched one of the unicorns, however, he realized what the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s area was for.\n\nBlood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel couldn\u2019t move any other universal cogwheel, no matter how small or light it might be. However, it COULD push self-cogwheels.\n\nYes. The self-cogwheels of people. The Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s cogwheel connected with the self-cogwheels of others.\n\nHan Sen used his Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s self-cogwheel to connect with Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel. He pushed his self-cogwheel and used its power to affect Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t simply pushing a self-cogwheel to release more power, though. His action activated Lando\u2019s blood on a deeper level.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s cogwheel wouldn\u2019t make creatures strong, but it could modify the flaws of a creature\u2019s genes, and it could even activate hidden genes.\n\nHow deep the effect could go depended on the hidden genes of the creature in question.\n\nIron ore could be forged into steel, but it couldn\u2019t be transformed into gold. In the same way, the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s power could correct a creature\u2019s flaws and help it develop according to its nature.\n\nIron, silver, or gold, it all depended on the creature. Han Sen\u2019s Blood-Pulse Sutra only provided refinement and aid.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, though, it looked like the Blood-Pulse Sutra was speeding up a creature\u2019s evolution.\n\nIt was like if a land-dwelling creature was forced to live in the ocean. If their genes had a potential that would be useful for water, then after a billion years of evolution, they might grow lungs like a fish.\n\nThe Blood-Pulse Sutra, however, could speed up that entire process. A change that would normally require thousands of years and countless generations might now happen in seconds.\n\nOf course, everything was dependent on a person\u2019s genes and hidden powers. The Blood-Pulse Sutra couldn\u2019t turn stone into a clump of gold.\n\nBut the Blood-Pulse Sutra, when used on Lando, provided fairly amazing results. It worked a hundred times better than Han Sen had expected.\n\nHan Sen thought it might help push Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel to the max, returning the man\u2019s body to optimal condition.\n\nLando\u2019s self-cogwheel was very heavy. It took all of Han Sen\u2019s strength to push Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel to spin a little faster.\n\nBut who would have guessed that the speed of Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel would begin to increase on its own? Even the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo changed, as well.\n\nThis surprised Han Sen because the Blood-Pulse Sutra\u2019s first-tier power was limited. Han Sen had just started using the area, so pushing a King\u2019s self-cogwheel was presumably the best he could do.\n\nThe Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was deified. According to Han Sen\u2019s general understanding of how the Blood-Pulse Sutra worked, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to push it.\n\nBut when Lando\u2019s self-cogwheel accelerated, the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo magically changed, too. The flaws that had previously plagued the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo had now vanished, and the tattoo had become perfect.\n\nThe scariest thing was that Lando\u2019s genes had also been perfected. He was no on the verge of becoming deified, and the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was beginning to influence Lando\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen went rigid with shock as the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo\u2019s power surged through Lando. The Dragon pushed through the final wall that stopped him, and he suddenly generated a substance chain. He had become deified.\n\nCountless people and creatures across the geno universe looked at Han Sen, who was touching Lando\u2019s forehead like some ancient deity.\n\nA moment later, Lando\u2019s presence combined with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. It rushed out into the sky as a scary substance chain came down on Lando.\n\nIn front of Han Sen, dark sinews of power waved and thrashed. The substance chains were breaking space, and Lando looked like some heavenly being of power. Everyone\u2019s brain felt empty. They couldn\u2019t believe this.\n\nThey were all thinking numbly, \u201cHow did Lando become deified? Is Han Sen really a father of gods?\u201d"
