    "text": "\u201cNo, I will figure out how to get out of this by myself,\u201d Han Sen said coldly.\n\nMister White shook his head and smiled. \u201cThat is no ordinary fruit, as you should be able to feel. It has you locked in place with no hope of escape. Even the strength of the blood kirin wasn\u2019t enough to free you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about this thing?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nMister White looked at the fruit tree and said, \u201cThis tree is known as the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree. It is one of the three treasure fruit trees. It is a deified plant xenogeneic. The legends say that all three treasure fruit trees are located in the Sacred Leader\u2019s own gardens, and those three are the only ones in existence. I cannot believe that we\u2019re standing right in front of one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Mister White went on to say, \u201cThe three treasure fruit trees I\u2019ve been talking about are the Bronze Treasure Fruit Tree, the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree, and the Gold Treasure Fruit Tree. They each have their own unique powers. The only one that matters right now is this one: the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree. As you can see, it has silver sycees that are capable of suppressing one\u2019s soul. They exert force directly on the soul, bypassing the body completely. Because your soul is being locked down, it doesn\u2019t matter if you use every ounce of strength you possess; your body will not be able to throw off the suppression. This does not just apply to someone like you, either. And that doesn\u2019t just apply to people of your power level, either. Even a deified being couldn\u2019t free themselves from that suppression.\u201d\n\nAfter saying all this, Mister White smiled. \u201cOf course, this effect only activates once the silver fruit has been touched. A deified elite would have the sense not to make physical contact with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis thing cannot be eaten?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. If he had known all of this sooner, he wouldn\u2019t have gone and picked up the silver fruit with his bare hands.\n\n\u201cEaten?\u201d Mister White looked as if he was going to burst out laughing. \u201cUnless you want your soul to be locked down forever, why would you ever think about eating one of those?\u201d\n\nCrime laughed, too. \u201cYou want to eat the silver fruit? I\u2019m afraid I have to tell you that you are the only person in the entire universe who would think like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what do the other fruits do? The bronze and gold ones,\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t ask out of idle curiosity. If they had found the Silver Treasure Fruit Tree in this palace, then the others might be nearby.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that you are currently suppressed by the silver sycee. Without my help, you will be stuck here forever. The palaces here are all connected in one way or another. It is only a matter of time before Fox Queen finds you. Do you think she\u2019ll let you leave this place alive?\u201d Mister White chuckled. \u201cGive me the stone plate, and we can explore this place together. I am only after one additional item. I will gladly share the rest.\u201d\n\nRealizing that he wouldn\u2019t be able to pry any more information about the bronze and gold fruits out of Mister White, Han Sen had to ask, \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. I will need first pick after we find the items. It will not be a great loss to you, and it is better than Fox Queen finding you and killing you. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s your offer, then you guys can leave. There is no need for us to cooperate,\u201d Han Sen said firmly.\n\nMister White frowned and said, \u201cDo you really think Fox Queen will spare you? The Shapeshifting Foxes are known to be capricious. She might have been nice to you at one point in time, but that won\u2019t stop her from killing you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that, but I have my own plans. There is no need for you two to worry about it,\u201d Han Sen replied confidently.\n\nCrime wished to say something, but Mister White stopped him. Mister White looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cI am good when it comes to restriction and prediction skills. I can help you avoid many risks, and I can also find the Sacred Leader\u2019s treasure quickly. Even if you aren\u2019t afraid of Fox Queen, being stuck here won\u2019t do you any good. You will have no choice but to sit there and watch Fox Queen treat herself to all the spoils.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can cooperate, but I must have the stone plate. I\u2019ll offer you the same deal but in reverse. I get to choose what I want first.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nMister White went silent and smiled. \u201cOkay. I will accept your terms.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect Mister White to agree so quickly. Crime was shocked, as well, and he said, \u201cMister White! How could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Without the stone plate, we cannot access the real treasure, anyway.\u201d Mister White waved his hand.\n\n\u201cIf you guys wish to cooperate, can you tell me how to get rid of this silver fruit?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Mister White.\n\n\u201cIt is not difficult. The silver fruit has the power to suppress souls. If it cannot feel your soul, then its suppressing power will be lifted. I have a geno art that can seal a soul. I will need to seal your soul so that the fruit cannot feel you. If we do this, you will be free from it,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cI see. The more I struggle, the harder it becomes to get out,\u201d Han Sen realized.\n\n\u201cIf you understand, then we should not waste any more time. We need to get to the treasure before Fox Queen does. I will use the sealing soul technique to get you out of here,\u201d Mister White said as he began walking forward to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHang on.\u201d Han Sen held up a hand. The blood kirin slid in front of Han Sen and presented its teeth to Mister White.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m not that treacherous! If I said we will cooperate, I won\u2019t betray my own words and do something bad to you,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cMister White, you worry too much. I trust you, but I don\u2019t actually need your help.\u201d Han Sen suddenly stood up. He lifted his hand easily, picking up the sycee and holding it before his eyes.\n\nMister White and Crime looked at Han Sen in shock, finding it difficult to believe their eyes. Han Sen was ignoring the silver sycee\u2019s soul-suppressing power completely. They found that hard to believe.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know exactly what the silver sycee did, but learning that the fruit suppressed a person\u2019s soul had changed things. Avoiding the soul-suppressing effects of the silver sycee was actually quite easy for Han Sen.\n\nThe Sea of Soul was different from the will of most ordinary creatures. If a creature lost their will, it would be as if they were dead. Their control over their body would be lost.\n\nHan Sen would be effected similarly if his Sea of Soul shut down. But ordinary people only had one soul. Han Sen\u2019s Sea of Soul, however, had many spirits and beast souls.\n\nHan Sen reduced his soul and let a beast soul power rise to the surface. The silver sycee then suppressed the beast soul instead of Han Sen. His soul immediately became light and buoyant.\n\n\u201cWe said half and half; are you interested in the silver sycees?\u201d Han Sen asked casually, playing with the silver sycee as he spoke.\n\n\u201cI could have sealed your soul to free you, but your body would have shut down. I cannot touch the silver fruit myself.\u201d Mister White shook his head.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want these, then I will take them with me,\u201d Han Sen stated happily. He swung his knife to cut down the other seven silver fruits.\n\nWith the help of the blood kirin, he cut down the other seven sycees with ease. He pocketed all of them.\n\nMister White and Crime were still frowning in consternation, which made it clear that they didn\u2019t understand how Han Sen had done what he had. They looked at each other, realizing that they were equally confused. They grew even more suspicious of Han Sen."
