Like a burial at sea?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nTo be entirely honest, Han Sen didn\u2019t actually believe Miss Mirror\u2019s claim. But with so many elites having shown up, something big had to have been going down.\n\nThe elites of the other races were all terrified of Miss Mirror. None dared to get close to her.\n\nMost of them milling around near the sea, though. They were all waiting for something to occur, just as Miss Mirror was.\n\nBut after a few days went by, nothing actually happened. Han Sen saw no evidence of the funeral that Miss Mirror had claimed would take place.\n\nIt had been six days by this point, and now, after all this time, Han Sen couldn\u2019t but ask a question. \u201cMiss Mirror, has the funeral not begun?\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror was being taken care of by her servants in the meantime, as if she was on vacation. She had nice food to enjoy, and people served her everything. They almost moved a bathtub there for her. She was living in what was practically splendor. Han Sen and the blood kirin, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t had a bite to eat over that entire length of time. Han Sen had reached the point where he could survive on the sustenance provided by absorbing universal energies, so while he would be fine, it was still pretty uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cWhy are you in such a rush? He isn\u2019t dead yet,\u201d Miss Mirror responded carelessly.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes widened, and he thought to himself, \u201cThey\u2019re planning a funeral for someone who hasn\u2019t yet died? And so many people are already here. Aren\u2019t they the ones in a rush? If the dying guy knew about this, he\u2019d probably be so angry that he\u2019d have a heart attack and die immediately.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought this was a very strange scenario, but Miss Mirror seemed unwilling to answer any other questions. So, there was nothing he could do about it.\n\n\u201cMiss Mirror, can I walk around? I am hungry, and I want some food to eat. Do not worry, I will not go far.\u201d Han Sen looked at Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cYou can go anywhere you wish. Just make sure you return before the funeral.\u201d Han Sen hadn\u2019t expected Miss Mirror to agree so simply. It was a quick response, as if she really had no desire to keep him imprisoned.\n\n\u201cThank you, madam.\u201d Han Sen turned around and abandoned the peak. After a while, he turned back to take a look. Miss Mirror wasn\u2019t watching him, and she hadn\u2019t sent anyone to keep tabs on him. It seemed as if she really did not care.\n\n\u201cDoes she know that I won\u2019t run off?\u201d Han Sen thought that Miss Mirror was a very strange woman. He wasn\u2019t going to dare trying to escape. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to run until he had retrieved Bao\u2019er, at the very least.\n\nAfter leaving the peak, Han Sen soon found that many elites from all sorts of races were present. Many of the races he saw were ones he had never seen before. After looking a little further, he found that a temporary market had been established.\n\nHan Sen felt relief well up in his heart, and he took off flying to the market immediately. There were many races occupying the various stalls. Lots of vendors had positioned themselves near the sea, many of them selling all sorts of xenogeneic items.\n\nThere were all kinds of levels, too. Some of the people around him looked like Viscounts or Barons, some looked like Kings, and some were of a capacity Han Sen couldn\u2019t even identify. Those were very scary.\n\nAgain, he noticed that all the creatures there had water element powers.\n\n\u201cThis surely cannot be a coincidence. Is something going to happen here that is associated with water powers? I already have that Original Water King Body. Is that why Miss Mirror has brought me here?\u201d That didn\u2019t seem right, though. Captain Water Moon was a deified water elite. If this was an important opportunity for water-users, Miss Mirror wouldn\u2019t have needed to bring a fraudulent prince there.\n\nHan Sen walked into the market. There were so many people and creatures there, so he figured it would be easy to collect some info. Everyone was talking to the vendors, after all.\n\nHan Sen walked around and watched the crowds before squatting down in front of a stall. He didn\u2019t choose the stall because of its wares, but because the stall\u2019s owner was low level. He could be bullied. Plus, it was one of the Kate. Therefore, in the consideration of other races, he was practically a nobody. His stall was in a corner and barely even noticeable.\n\nOf course, Han Sen wanted to bully him. It would be faster to get info out of him through doing that than by being pleasant.\n\n\u201cBig Brother, what I sell are true water xenogeneic treasures. What would you like?\u201d The Kate Baron smiled, introducing his unremarkable wares with genuine enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWho is your big brother?\u201d Han Sen put on a dour expression.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 I am sorry, Hot Man,\u201d the Kate Baron said quickly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Han Sen nodded, but inside, he thought, \u201cNo, I am here to play the bad guy. I should be called a boss.\u201d\n\nPretending to be evil didn\u2019t suit Han Sen very well, so he gave up the act. He pulled out a Viscount dagger and held it before the Baron. He said, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d\n\n\u201cHandsome, I\u2019m sorry! We do small business here. We only sell, and we do not buy. What about over there? That guy is so rich, he is sure to give you a high price.\u201d The owner looked fairly glum.\n\n\u201cWho said I am trying to sell you something? Look at me. Do I look broke enough to sell my goods to someone like you?\u201d Han Sen tossed the dagger down in front of the owner and spoke with a rich tone of voice. \u201cAnswer my questions and this can be yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are here for information? You could have just told me that sooner.\u201d The owner put the dagger into his pocket, patted his chest, and said, \u201cAsk me anything, handsome. Nothing goes on here that I don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think the man\u2019s information was going to be very reliable. For a Baron, he was talking a big game. He didn\u2019t look worried about giving away something that he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen wasn\u2019t hoping to learn any secrets. He just needed answers to some simple questions.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking around.\n\n\u201cHandsome, don\u2019t you see? I\u2019m here trying to earn money!\u201d Alang laughed.\n\n\u201cBe serious; who cares if you earn money. I\u2019m asking what everyone is doing here, on this planet!\u201d Han Sen stared at Alang, already regretting asking the man for information. He was useless.\n\nAlang looked as if he had woken from a dream, and he said, \u201cAh, you are asking about that? Why are you asking this? Aren\u2019t you here for the same thing? Here to watch the Ancient Water God?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised. There were stories of Water Gods in various races, but this one was special. And it was approved by the universe. Han Sen thought he had heard that this was a member of the Ancient God race.\n\n\u201cIs the funeral Miss Mirror mentioned the Ancient Water God\u2019s funeral? No way. The legends of the Ancient Gods say that they are all born deified. And they live so long, with a lifespan of a billion years. It is rare to see one of the Ancient Gods dying,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself."
