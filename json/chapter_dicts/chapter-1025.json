As soon as he arrived, Bao\u2019er leapt up to kiss his cheek and say, \u201cFather, I missed you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d Han Sen kissed her and then went off, looking for the silver fox.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura and found the fox lying atop the shelter\u2019s ramparts, just above the gate.\n\nHan Sen took Bao\u2019er with him to where the silver fox was and said, \u201cLittle Silver, I\u2019m back. There is no need to guard so fiercely anymore.\u201d\n\nThe silver fox just continued staring in the direction he had been. Han Sen could tell the silver fox was concerned about something, but all that did was make Han Sen worry, too.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Ghost Mountain was in the direction the silver fox faced.\n\nCaringly, Han Sen went to stroke the silver fox\u2019s head and ask him, \u201cDo you miss your friends?\u201d\n\nHan Sen believed the silver fox might have missed the fellow creatures back on Ghost Mountain, as they had treated him well for a long time.\n\nBefore he could receive a response, though, Han Sen\u2019s attention was snatched by the sudden sound of a cry. It came from Ghost Mountain.\n\nThe silver fox stood up in alarm, paying extra attention to the cry. He approached Han Sen\u2019s legs and rubbed his head against them.\n\nAcknowledging something was wrong, Han Sen stroked the silver fox\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nGently, the silver fox crooned as an answer. He jumped up, licked Han Sen\u2019s cheek, and then jumped off of the shelter\u2019s wall. The silver fox started to run in the direction of Ghost Mountain, but as it went, it repeatedly looked back at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen did not delay in going after the silver fox, but Little Silver kept on howling back at Han Sen\u2014who sought to give chase\u2014as if he was telling Han Sen to stay back and not follow him back to Ghost Mountain.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Little Silver? You can tell me!\u201d Han Sen did not heed the silver fox\u2019s warnings and continued pursuing him. Bao\u2019er was left behind in the meantime, up on the ramparts of the shelter.\n\nHan Sen thought about why the silver fox might not have come to see him in the very beginning, when he was up on Ghost Mountain. The silver fox had called off the super creature wolf. It was strange how he had only shown up after they exited the mountain.\n\nHowl! The silver fox tried to warn Han Sen off and get him to stop following.\n\n\u201cLittle Silver, is someone trying to bully you? Are you being threatened? What is that far-off cry?\u201d Han Sen increased his speed, to catch up with the silver fox.\n\nAlthough Little Silver was not a human, he was a creature Han Sen had raised since its birth. At one point, the silver fox was his most trusted ally and side-kick. He was family to Han Sen, and he couldn\u2019t just let the fox run off into danger.\n\nIt was okay if the silver fox wanted to go back there to be with the creatures. Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have forced him to stay with him, if that was the concern. But if something was forcing the silver fox to do something against his will, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t stand for it.\n\nLittle Silver slowed down due to Han Sen\u2019s repeated calls, but the crying noise from Ghost Mountain started up again. Little Silver barked at Han Sen, and then, with a bolt of lightning, ran off.\n\nThe silver fox was incredibly quick, and Han Sen had no chance of following him. The creature was going to leave his range of vision in no time.\n\nWith eight gene locks open, though, Han Sen did his best to try and catch up.\n\nHe had fallen behind, yes, but he still continued on his way to Ghost Mountain. That was where the silver fox was headed, after all.\n\nThe silver fox heard the upset howling again and stopped in his tracks.\n\nSeeing him stop in the distance put a smile back on Han Sen\u2019s face. But as he neared the silver fox again, and was close to catching up, Little Silver electrified him.\n\nThe silver fox barked at Han Sen, commanding that he stop following.\n\nBringing himself back up to his feet, Han Sen was not mad at his behavior. He said, \u201cIf you are willingly going back, I won\u2019t stop you. But if someone is making you do something against your own will, I\u2019m not leaving your side.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nThe silver fox shot Han Sen with another bolt of lightning, but after, he looked a little remorseful. He seemed to have been touched by Han Sen\u2019s words, despite his initial reaction.\n\nShrugging off the pain, Han Sen continued to approach the silver fox.\n\nLittle Silver couldn\u2019t bring himself to shock Han Sen the third time, so he just barked, ran, and leapt up into Han Sen\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cLittle Silver, I don\u2019t want you to leave me.\u201d Han Sen stroked the silver fox\u2019s head with much love.\n\nLittle Silver licked his dear master\u2019s cheeks and barked quietly, as if he wished to speak with him in a common language.\n\nBut suddenly, the silver fox jumped away from Han Sen and made all his fur stand on end.\n\nHan Sen suddenly felt a terrible presence drawing near. Turning to take a look at where it was coming from, he saw a black shadow approaching them from across the field.\n\nThe shadow was very slow, but every step made Han Sen feel as if the very world was under-threat. It was as if the world was shrinking, the nearer it drew.\n\nHan Sen could sense a terrifying power residing within that black shadow.\n\nNow, Han Sen believed he understood the reason why the silver fox had not revealed his presence as soon as he probably wanted to.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that the silver fox did not want to be with Han Sen, it was this shadow that was stopping him. He only revealed himself when he did because it had been a life and death moment for Han Sen. The assault of those bugs out on the plains could have ended poorly for all the humans involved.\n\nStaring at the scary shadow, Han Sen thought even the intimidation of the snake paled in comparison to it."
