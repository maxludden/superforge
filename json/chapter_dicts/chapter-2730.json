    "text": "Han Sen grinned widely at the sensation. That hot air was some kind of lifeforce. The Good Fortune Pool should also reinforce his genes, but that lifeforce alone would benefit him a great deal.\n\nUnder the cleansing power of that intense lifeforce, Han Sen felt his body filling with energy. It was like he could play Mahjong for three days in a row without getting tired.\n\nBut the pure lifeforce wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause changes in Han Sen\u2019s actual body. Han Sen cleared his head and started casting the Dongxuan Sutra, so he could absorb the gene powers of the pool in the hopes of achieving a breakthrough.\n\nAs soon as Han Sen began to cast the Dongxuan Sutra, he felt like there was an unstoppable channel of energy surging into his body. It made each cell of his body come alive and rapidly change.\n\nA mere second later, Han Sen felt something thicken within his Dongxuan Sutra. The geno art was showing signs of the nine tiers condensing into one.\n\n\u201cToo strong! It\u2019s too strong! This Good Fortune Pool is unbelievable.\u201d Han Sen was as shocked as he was happy. The Good Fortune Pool\u2019s energy was so strong, and it was giving him more power than he had expected. By a substantial margin, too.\n\n\u201cIf I had known what an incredible resource this pool is, I would have found a way to come here sooner. I would just need to take a bath. Becoming half-deified that way would be easier than giving myself a scrub. If I had come here sooner, my four geno arts would have become half-deified a long time ago. I would have saved myself a lot of trouble,\u201d Han Sen thought as he continued to run the Dongxuan Sutra as rapidly as possible.\n\nBuzz!\n\nA moment later, Han Sen felt like his body was exploding with power. It felt like countless universal cogwheels were spinning with the Dongxuan Sutra. The force of it pushed Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Sutra\u2019s cogwheel, easily spurring him on to become half-deified.\n\nHan Sen was surprised, but he didn\u2019t have time to explore the differences that had come by reaching half-deified with the Dongxuan Sutra. He immediately cast Jadeskin. He wanted to use the frightening power around him to boost Jadeskin, as well.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly because the Good Fortune Pool was giving Han Sen so much power. When Jadeskin absorbed the power, Han Sen didn\u2019t feel any resistance. The geno art went straight into the condensing sequence, and all its tiers combined into one.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s entire body transformed into icy jade. He suddenly looked like a statue. As Jadeskin kept changing, his body became more and more like crystal. It shone as clearly and radiantly as a diamond.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe jade veneer suddenly tore itself off, like flaky dust being swept away from Han Sen\u2019s body. Layer after layer, it went, and as it peeled away, the flesh of Han Sen\u2019s body was reborn. It was like he had gotten rid of his old bones and installed a fresh skeleton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s leveling up already?\u201d Han Sen could barely believe this. Elevating the Dongxuan Sutra and Jadeskin to half-deified had been the simplest thing in the world. And there was even more gene power surging into his body. It was like he had expected rainfall, but now an entire river of water was plunging down on him. It was too much. Han Sen could scarcely comprehend it.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong\u2026 Something must be wrong\u2026\u201d Han Sen continued to absorb the energy, but he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\n\nAccording to the analysis of the Very High, the Good Fortune Pool had been created by different deified xenogeneic genes combining together. It was a mixture. Therefore, the composition of the water was quite complicated.\n\nWhen ordinary creatures entered the Good Fortune Pool, they absorbed a lot of the Good Fortune Pool\u2019s water, but they could only refine the gene power of the water that was compatible with their own genes. A lot of the harmful gene power had to be neutralized or expunged. Otherwise, it could seriously damage their bodies.\n\nFor instance, if a creature that practiced fire powers came to the Good Fortune Pool, it would have to expel all the water element powers that it absorbed. Otherwise, the conflicting element would damage the fire creature.\n\nBecause most of the gene power in the water wouldn\u2019t suit most people, a person couldn\u2019t spend too long inside the pool. When the harmful gene power reached a high enough level to harm the body, they would have to leave the Good Fortune Pool. Once they left the pool, they would have to carefully release all the harmful gene power.\n\nIf the person in the pool triggered a vision, then the vision would release other gene powers and attract helpful gene powers for the person to absorb. So, when a vision appeared, the person could absorb vast amounts of gene powers, far more than usual. The harmful gene powers would only be a small part of the mixture. Therefore, the benefits those people received would be far better than those who couldn\u2019t trigger a vision, and they could spend much longer inside the Good Fortune Pool.\n\nBut now, Han Sen\u2019s situation was a strange one. He had been absorbing the powers of the good fortune genes for a while. A vision had yet to appear, but the gene powers that he was absorbing seemed perfectly compatible with every fiber of his being. None of the gene powers seemed harmful to him, as the theories he had heard suggested they should be. It was like all the Good Fortune Water was the purest type of gene power. Every drop helped him and aided the progress of his geno arts. There wasn\u2019t a speck of harm entering him.\n\nHan Sen swallowed like a whale and sucked like a mosquito. He absorbed more and more energy. He was taking in so much that he was almost afraid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absorbing so much gene power. Why isn\u2019t something stopping my progress? It is like I can keep on sucking down as much as I want to. This is so weird,\u201d Han Sen thought, slightly disturbed.\n\nIt felt as if he had gone to a steakhouse buffet. Most people could eat three steaks before being full, while Han Sen had already eaten a dozen, and he was still going strong. His belly seemed to have endless room for him to keep on munching.\n\nEven Han Sen was surprised by this unusual situation. He was almost afraid to keep on eating.\n\n\u201cIs it because my body doesn\u2019t have any special elements, so I can absorb any elemental gene power? Is that why this weird situation is happening?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nAlthough this explanation seemed a bit unconvincing, the good stuff that was coming into his mouth wasn\u2019t something he was going to refuse.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of energy. If I keep on taking it in, will I become deified straight away?\u201d Han Sen was both awed and pleased by that thought. \u201cIf that is true, that would be awesome.\u201d\n\nHan Sen cast the Story of Genes like crazy. Over the years that he had practiced it, the geno art had always demanded more sources than he had to give. He didn\u2019t know where or when he would find an opportunity like this again if he didn\u2019t take advantage of it now.\n\nHan Sen absorbed the power from the Good Fortune Pool like mad. Shale and Li Chun Qiu were watching the changes occur from outside the Good Fortune Pool.\n\nThe Good Fortune Pool\u2019s lifeforce was as insane as it always was. The spring water was swirling like a vortex, but other than that, nothing weird was happening. They didn\u2019t see Han Sen come up to the surface.\n\n\u201cIt has been half an hour. Why has Han Sen not come out yet?\u201d Shale asked with confusion.\n\nFor a King that hadn\u2019t triggered a vision, half an hour was usually the longest they could last. Even the best half-deified would end up harming their body after that.\n\nBut Han Sen had neither activated a vision nor emerged from the Good Fortune Pool. It wasn\u2019t only Shale who was curious about this. Li Chun Qiu was, as well."
