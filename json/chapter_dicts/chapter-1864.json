    "text": "Seventy-two moons were out in the sky. It was an incredibly pretty sight.\n\nThe whole of Narrow Moon was silent. The elites like Yisha and Moon Wheel King were completely speechless. They had watched each moon rise.\n\nThe Rebate had only ever managed to reach thirty-six moons, but that prestigious number had not just been beaten\u2014it had been doubled. No one had seen this before.\n\nAfter that, though, no more moons rose. It brought the Nobles a modicum of relief. If it kept going, they were going to doubt everything they had thought true in their lives.\n\nBoom!\n\nJust as everyone thought Han Sen\u2019s blessings had come to an end, the seventy-two moons atop Moon Palace shone with exuberant brilliance. Basking in the glow of seventy-two casts of moonlight, Moon God Palace was luminous. The cells in Han Sen\u2019s body rapidly began to change, as a result.\n\nBzzt!\n\nHis bones screamed. The moonlight came out of Han Sen\u2019s body, like a robe to completely wrap him up. He was like a Moon King.\n\n\u201cGeno Body Jadeskin has ascended to Viscount class.\u201d\n\nThe same time this occurred, another noise shot through Han Sen\u2019s mind. It gave him a shock. He had received a body that was Viscount class. He could now cast energy on the outside.\n\nWhen Jadeskin reached Viscount status, the moonlight across the palace was finally reduced. His body began to go back to normal.\n\nQuickly, the moonlight around Moon God Palace began to evaporate until there was nothing left. Han Sen was left standing in the hall, looking up at the seventy-two moons. Suddenly, they started to shine again like suns.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe seventy-two moons began shining back down into the hall, with a focus on one spot in particular.\n\nDue to the moonlight being focused, people could now see into the hall. Everyone saw Han Sen, standing inside. And the seventy-two beams of moonlight weren\u2019t coming down on him, but on a spot that was about three steps ahead.\n\nThe moonlight looked tangible and solid. And inside those concentrated beams stood a woman. Looking a little closer, however, it was apparent that she was only a shadow. She did not look real.\n\nThe lady looked at Han Sen and pointed with her slender finger. She pointed it at Han Sen\u2019s forehead, then began moving her lips. No noise came from her mouth, but a voice sounded in the heads of all.\n\n\u201cBy the name of Moon God, I bless you. It does not matter which race you hail from, for you are the Son of the Moon. You will be guided and protected by the power of the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe moonlight on her finger went straight between Han Sen\u2019s eyebrows. It spread out across his head, then cleansed the entirety of his body. After that, the pretty woman smiled at him. Her body faded away, and the moons became dim and disappeared.\n\nEveryone in Narrow Moon had their mouths open. Only one thought ran through their minds.\n\n\u201cThat was a genuine Moon God blessing. The one\u2019s before weren\u2019t anything like that, and Moon God never revealed herself. They weren\u2019t blessings, then!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the proper Moon God blessing. He has qualified to earn the title of Son of the Moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy him? After all these years, we Rebate never once received a proper Moon God blessing like this. And now, its an outsider who got one!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder what the effects of a true Moon God blessing are. He earned the title Son of the Moon, and she told him he was protected by the moon. Even so, he should still walk out as a low-rank.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows? We will have to ask Han Sen ourselves. He is the only one who has ever received such a blessing. I don\u2019t think Moon Wheel King and Yisha know what this stuff is about, either.\u201d\n\nYisha looked at Han Sen strangely as she walked out of the palace. Aside from a troublesome geno art, her student was practically perfect. But that geno art would be harmful, and even Yisha herself did not think it was possible to bring it up to King class.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeds, this King class geno art will be the scariest ever.\u201d Yisha glanced around nervously.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s performance made her want to train him well, but the thought of the resources required to bring him up still gnawed at her. Especially if she was to bring him up to King class. She didn\u2019t think it was something she could realistically afford.\n\nIcebird Duke looked as if she had a conflicted mind. She did not understand why Han Sen was so special. He had been taken in by Queen and found a King class weapon. He had now just received the true blessing of Moon God. It looked like everything good in the world happened to him, and him alone. He was far too lucky.\n\n\u201cWas he a virgin in ten previous lives, to receive so much luck now?\u201d Icebird Duke wondered.\n\nNight River King and Black-Moon King were in shock, as well. They were both thinking, \u201cQueen\u2019s student got a King class weapon and the Moon God\u2019s blessing. He also has those weirdly brilliant shoes. Did he save the entire universe in his past life?\u201d\n\nThis guy\u2019s luck is scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is over-powered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, its nothing. He\u2019s just lucky. If I had his luck, I\u2019d be even more over-powered.\u201d\n\nThe Nobles and commoners spoke about these matters a lot. While many were jovial about it, many expressed only jealousy.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t think much about it, but eventually, he walked out of the palace. He wanted to teleport back to Planet Blade. He wanted to research the geno art in the moonlight.\n\nBut outside the palace, many people had gathered. They were all looking at Han Sen, and unless he chose to fly above them, his way was completely blocked.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Han Sen blinked, and the young ones that had joined the festival woke up from their daze.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, fight me! You cannot run now.\u201d Night Giant God was holding a knife that was as big as a door. He was pointing it at Han Sen.\n\nThe other young ones surrounded Han Sen, refusing to let him run off this time.\n\nThey wanted to witness the performance of the first person to ever receive the Moon God blessing.\n\n\u201cFight! Fight!\u201d The people who were watching the livestream were all chanting. They wanted to see a fight, too. But of course, no matter how loudly they shouted, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t hear it."
