The feet of his nemesis were continuing their descent, but they came into contact with the orb which plushily pushed down on Xie Qing King\u2019s face to cushion the blow. He was still alive.\n\nGold General raised his legs once more. Even if a ball-like cushion had come to soften the blow, he thought it curious how it had not been broken by his supercharged curb stomp.\n\nAfter lifting up his leg, the squishy white thing returned to its spherical shape as if it had not been harmed in the slightest. The orb then began to circle around Xie Qing King, hoping to protect him from any further hits.\n\nSnowball had spent most of his time with Xie Qing King, and they had fought alongside each other under dire circumstances once before. He was worried for his wellbeing, and despite being a scaredy-cat, even Snowball wasn\u2019t going to stand idly by while his friend suffered such terrible wrath.\n\nSnowball used to find himself getting bullied in the shelter when he first came into Han Sen\u2019s care. After befriending Xie Qing King, though, this negative treatment stopped. And ever since then, it was only Bao\u2019er who took the occasional time out to exercise her frustrations and bully Snowball.\n\nSnowball was afraid of stepping out, risking his life for others. But he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting Xie Qing King die when he had the chance to do something. So, with a grand mustering of courage, he shielded himself in the white sphere, ran out to Xie Qing King, and tried to be as spry as he could to protect him.\n\nWoof! Woof! Woof!\n\nThe furry creature\u2019s fear was greater than ever now that he was in harm\u2019s way, but he still jovially barked at Xie Qing King to let him know that he was there, and in delight at knowing that his initial rescue had been a success.\n\nBut Xie Qing King was injured too badly to respond, and he couldn\u2019t stand up, either.\n\nGold General looked at the white orb with much disdain and tried to curb stomp Xie Qing King again. Snowball quickly dashed beneath where the foot was to land and blocked the attempt. The ball was pushed down a great deal, but it did not break.\n\nGold General did this many times, and he tried stomping the white sphere multiple times in a row. As much as he was surprised, he was frustrated at his inability to break the white orb that taunted him.\n\nAgain and again, he stomped on the white sphere like a raving lunatic. But still, the orb held strong.\n\nGold General then tried something else, and he pulled out a golden spike from beneath his gauntlets. It was like a terrifying cocktail stick.\n\nAs if he was going to fiercely pop a balloon, he leaped towards the white ball and drove the spike into it like a stake would be driven into the heart of an incapacitated vampire before it woke.\n\nThe sphere was flattened, but not to the point it could pop just yet. Acknowledging the need for more strength, Gold General pushed down harder on the orb.\n\nLike a mist of chalk, white dust began to clog the immediate vicinity as Gold General continued to press his sharp golden prod into Snowball\u2019s snowball. After an extra loud pang sound, the orb popped open to reveal the furry little critter that had been pestering Gold General. It came rolling out the orb roughly.\n\nGold General kicked Snowball away, as if he was simple vermin that was no longer worth his time.\n\nThe kick was a rough one, though. Snowball was sent coursing through a number of concrete walls before coming to a stop, shivering on the precipice of death.\n\nThe Holy Rhino immediately applied a heal on the creature, but it\u2019d take a while for it to get back on its feet. And a restoration of its courage was another matter entirely.\n\nGold General now walked over to the Holy Rhino and tried to kill it, as it had initially sought to do.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d A voice sounded from directly behind the general.\n\nGold General turned to see the bloodied, broken-bodied Xie Qing King standing there. His eyes gleamed with silver, wanting to make one last effort before submitting to the cold embrace of death.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Gold General threw a punch towards Xie Qing King\u2019s head, in one last bid to destroy the noggin he so much loathed.\n\nXie Qing King was trembling with the last bit of power he wished to exhaust on his foe. He also knew there\u2019d be no turning back now, as an attempt to dodge or block the attack would be futile.\n\nOne of Snowball\u2019s eyes had been squished like jelly after the kick it received earlier, and now, with its other one half-open, it looked at Xie Qing King and barked in sadness.\n\nAnd unable to dodge the attack, all Xie Qing King could do now was hope he had bought the Holy Rhino enough time to supply everyone with what they needed, and for Han Sen to possibly return before it was too late.\n\nSeeing the fist bear down on him, ready to finish him off, Xie Qing King looked at it with wide eyes. He wanted to see that which was trying to kill him; he wasn\u2019t going to turn away. And as he watched it come, he watched as another fist reached out from nowhere and blocked it.\n\nGold General was as shocked as Xie Qing King was, acknowledging it was Xie Qing King\u2019s own hand that had somehow stopped the hit despite his grievous injuries.\n\nXie Qing King grabbed the fist and smiled with a seething hiss.\n\n\u201cIn my comic, sh*t characters like you don\u2019t survive more than three chapters,\u201d Xie Qing King said, as his lips formed a faint smirk.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Gold General threw another fist at Xie Qing King.\n\nXie Qing King grabbed this fist, too, and said, \u201cI was going to be nice and let you live, despite the fact you\u2019re some emperor\u2019s yes-man jellyfish. But then you go and hit my little homey over there? Bruh, you done goofed. It\u2019s time to write you out of this. I\u2019ll see you on the cutting room floor.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Xie Qing King\u2019s body blazed with a silver light unlike anything anyone had ever witnessed before.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Gold General could feel Xie Qing King unleashing the true extent of his powers, and he could quickly feel that strength overwhelming his own.\n\nHis hands were like chains, latched tightly around his fists. There was no escape.\n\nGold General, in his panic, tried to do all that he could to break free. He began swinging his legs like a madman in a bid to escape.\n\nGold General was happy that Xie Qing King had not tried to dodge his fierce kneeing, but that slight modicum of joy turned to shock and fright a second later.\n\nHis knee was only one inch away from striking Xie Qing King\u2019s belly, but it could go no further.\n\nNo matter what he tried, his knee kept stopping one inch short of its target.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Gold General was terrified. Loss was something he rarely felt, and more than anything right now, all he wanted to do was leave.\n\nHe wanted to leave, but Xie Qing King\u2019s grasp was too tight and forbade him from doing so.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Gold General could not repel the power, and he was dragged closer and closer into the silver sun before him.\n\nBoom!\n\nGold General was pulled into the silver star, resulting in a devastating explosion that turned the entire sky silver.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Gold General let out one last scream of agony. A second later, it was cut short.\n\nMoment Queen herself was shocked seeing this, and she watched as half the shelter was turned to gravel and dirt by the release of that power.\n\nEveryone fell back seeing this. A giant crater was all that remained where that power had been unleashed, and at its center stood Xie Qing King. And that was all.\n\nNext, Xie Qing King pulled out a cigar and lit it. With a deep inhale and a puff of outward smoke, he said, \u201cOh, I know what the ladies like. And to all you who seek to push their luck like the Golden Dong did? Listen up, because you don\u2019t get to fight the author and expect to win, boys and girls. \u201d\n\nXie Qing King gave Snowball a thumbs up.\n\nSnowball came crawling out of the rubble, wishing to give a reply. But then, he saw Xie Qing King suddenly collapse as a stream of silver blood began to pour out of him."
