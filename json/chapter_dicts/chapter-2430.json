    "text": "\u201cIf we can grab that sword, maybe we can use it to widen the tree hole and retrieve the requiem tree egg,\u201d Night Wind said, his eyes bright with anticipation.\n\n\u201cThat might actually work. Maybe someone or something wants us to go back and retrieve that sword,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThe entire scenario seemed a little too convenient, though. They had chosen to leave the sword behind on the road, despite what the pictures on the screen seemed to indicate. Now, they had been presented with a tantalizing prize that would force them to return and retrieve the sword after all. They seemed to be drifting slowly closer to the reality that the screen had predicted.\n\n\u201cI am willing to give it a try. I will go find the sword again and bring it back,\u201d Night Wind said to Miss Mirror.\n\n\u201cGo, but be careful,\u201d Miss Mirror said, her voice distracted and distant.\n\n\u201cYes, I will get it done.\u201d Night Wind bowed, turned around, and walked away.\n\nAfter taking a few steps, Night Wind stopped. He looked at the Duke. He thought for a moment and then said to Miss Mirror, \u201cMy Lady, this guy isn\u2019t going to make it. Why don\u2019t I put him out of his misery now?\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew what the man meant. Night Wind was obviously still scared about the prophetic pictures they had seen on the screen. If he got rid of the Duke, however, there\u2019d be one less faceless man. That would mean the prophecy could be proven wrong, and it was nothing more than an illusion.\n\nMiss Mirror nodded. Night Wind picked up the Duke and left.\n\n\u201cIs it wise to let him go?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Miss Mirror.\n\nHan Sen thought that Miss Mirror and Night Wind knew more than they were saying, but Miss Mirror hadn\u2019t tried to stop Night Wind from leaving. That confused Han Sen.\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t move, and her voice was chilly. \u201cYou think he would stay if I forbade him from going?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, Night Wind will betray us for the requiem tree egg?\u201d Han Sen now understood what Miss Mirror was getting at. If she stopped Night Wind from getting the sword, and Night Wind wanted the requiem tree egg badly enough, what happened in the picture might actually come to pass.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know for certain if Night Wind will betray us, but when something as valuable as this egg lies in the balance, loyalties can be tested. The requiem tree egg is a treasure that is far too tempting, and there would be few consequences for breaking the rules right now. I have to be careful.\u201d Miss Mirror ended with a sigh.\n\n\u201cFrom what you know of Night Wind, if he really brings back the sword and claims the requiem tree egg, do you think he\u2019d go the extra mile and do\u2026 something else?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d Miss Mirror shook her head, and then she said, \u201cSo, we just need to be prepared. I hope that Night Wind doesn\u2019t decide to betray us, but if he does, we need a contingency in place that can keep us breathing. I\u2019m no longer what I once was, remember. I am only King class. If we fight, I cannot hope to beat Night Wind. Our only chance of surviving is if you and I work together.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you and I work together, fighting a deified elite won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nMiss Mirror brushed her fingers across her bangs, smiled, and said, \u201cEven if ten ordinary Kings allied together, their collective power might not be enough to defeat Night Wind. But you and I are different. If we work together, even if we cannot beat him, we should be able to keep ourselves alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am with you, of course, my Lady.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have become King class, I still have the mind of a deified. And I understand Night Wind\u2019s power. I know all about Night Wind. I will just need you to do as I say. If he really tries to do something rash, we\u2019ll hold him back long enough that we can escape.\u201d Miss Mirror said.\n\n\u201cI will listen to you, my Lady,\u201d Han Sen answered quickly, but he had a different plan in mind.\n\nThings had become complicated. The three of them each had their own plan. Although they all had individual goals, they knew that surviving in such a place would be difficult. But none of them could resist the temptation of the requiem tree egg.\n\nAlthough Miss Mirror hadn\u2019t said anything about it, she obviously had her own thoughts about the requiem tree egg. She just hadn\u2019t been obvious about it like Night Wind.\n\nBoth of them went silent. Han Sen thought it wasn\u2019t a good idea to let the uncomfortable silence grow, so he started talking. \u201cDo you think Night Wind can safely retrieve that big sword?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Miss Mirror paused. \u201cIt definitely seems like something is orchestrating this situation, trying to drive us to fight for the requiem tree egg. Since this entity obviously seems to require the big sword, common sense should tell you that the sword is dangerous. But Night Wind went to retrieve it anyway, and he isn\u2019t stupid. Since he insisted on going, he might have an ulterior motive. Maybe\u2026\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t finish her thought, but the look on her face suggested that she was worried.\n\nHan Sen picked up where Miss Mirror had left off, and he said, \u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t concerned about the future that the screen seemed to foretell?\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror didn\u2019t respond. It was like a silent agreement.\n\nHan Sen went on to say, \u201cIf the prophecy is false, then Night Wind is fine with that. If the prophecy is true, then the person wielding the sword should be fine anyway. After all, whoever takes the sword in the prophecy will be the one who claims the egg and survives. The odds for survival are swinging wildly in Night Wind\u2019s favor, with how things currently stand. You and I cannot take him down if things go badly.\u201d\n\nMiss Mirror nodded. She agreed.\n\n\u201cBut there is one thing I don\u2019t understand. How can Night Wind be sure that nothing will kill him when he grabs the sword?\u201d Han Sen asked Miss Mirror.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t familiar with Night Wind, so he couldn\u2019t guess the answer with any confidence.\n\n\u201cDo not underestimate any deified being. Night Wind isn\u2019t the most powerful deified, but the simple fact that he reached the deified level still means a lot. Do not be misled by his apparent loyalty and service to me. It can put you on a slippery slope to a painful demise,\u201d Miss Mirror said, her voice hard.\n\nHan Sen shrugged. He did not say anything more. He looked back along the path behind them, hoping to see something.\n\nNight Wind should have already returned with the sword by now. If some sort of trap had been laid on or around the sword, he should have already triggered it.\n\nBut the ruined city was still deathly quiet. There wasn\u2019t a single sound. They had no way of knowing if Night Wind had removed the sword or not yet.\n\nWhile Han Sen was thinking, a shadow appeared far down the path. It looked like Night Wind\u2019s.\n\nIndeed, when the figure drew closer, Han Sen could see that it was Night Wind returning. He had a big sword slung over his shoulder, which looked just like the one they had seen before.\n\nBut contrary to their expectations, the sword was only one meter long. The tip was flat as if it had been snapped off. The sword was broken.\n\nThat surprised Miss Mirror and Han Sen both, and they swapped curious glances with each other."
