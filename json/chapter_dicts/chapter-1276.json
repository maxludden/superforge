That was something he had never seen a spirit do before.\n\nMoment Queen went on to say, \u201cI failed my ascension of The Ten Steps of the Holy Door, and following my failure, I was captured by my enemy. After that, they cast me back to the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means what you told me before, in the beginning, was false.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true. I killed the son of an emperor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was his title?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo God.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard this, he almost spat out the water he had just taken a swig of.\n\nHan Sen had heard about No God before, when he was competing in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary\u2019s Divinity\u2019s Bout, but he was too weak to reach the top ten.\n\nNo God reigned supreme, beating out all other challengers to become number one. If No God was her enemy, she must have been powerful. But somehow, she had been repeatedly bullied by Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d Han Sen thought she might have read the list of spirits that competed in the tourney and was fabricating another falsehood.\n\nMoment Queen pleaded, \u201cNot many king spirits know about the Aqua Fruit Core. You have many king spirits in your service, so why don\u2019t you ask them? See if they know.\u201d\n\nHan Sen already believed her, though. He maintained a dubious guise, but he knew she possessed a lot of knowledge, and the manner she spoke carried a weight of earnestness this time.\n\nMoment Queen proceeded to tell Han Sen how to use the core, but she told him he could only use one. Using any more than one could be harmful.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it only worked with certainty on spirits. It could work on humans, but there was no guarantee it\u2019d help.\n\nHan Sen planned on getting the core out of Yaksha\u2019s head, to begin with. He wanted Moment Queen to do it, but she said if she did, it would latch onto her instead. It was quite like a parasite. She\u2019d also need a pure weapon to dig it out.\n\nHan Sen was caught off-guard by her comments, as he had managed to dig another one out of the fish king with no issue.\n\n\u201cWas it because of my Blood-Pulse Sutra? I mean, God\u2019s Retribution managed to grab a fruit without becoming a host to the parasite. And Blood-Pulse Sutra is something we both have in common,\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nHan Sen entered the bottle and cut the core out of Yaksha\u2019s head. Moment Queen was shocked to witness this. Han Sen was able to touch the core with no adverse effects.\n\nYaksha woke up, and when he saw Han Sen, he spared no time in trying to attack. His fury was so great, the black smoke that billowed around him was nearly asphyxiating.\n\nThe Cruel Bottle was a separate dimension of sorts, but that was the extent of it. It couldn\u2019t suppress an individual\u2019s power. Han Sen was not afraid, though. Nowadays, he had the capacity to defeat emperors.\n\nHan Sen pulled out his Phoenix Sword and swung it towards Yaksha. When Yaksha saw the sword, it suddenly disappeared. Then it was Yaksha\u2019s arm that was missing.\n\nYaksha\u2019s face twisted in disbelief of how powerful Han Sen had become. Han Sen didn\u2019t want to kill him, though, as he did not know what would happen if Yaksha died.\n\nIf he couldn\u2019t resurrect, then it\u2019d be a waste.\n\nHan Sen wished to ask Yaksha about Asura and Dragon King, especially about the former. He thought there was a connection between Asura and the shura.\n\nYaksha was one of the eight generals, so there was a hearty chance Han Sen could learn something off the fiend.\n\nHan Sen coldly told him, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where am I? What is this place?\u201d Yaksha could not feel his spirit stone, so a legitimate fear was taking hold of him.\n\n\u201cThat is not for you to know. What you need to know, and in turn tell me, is whether you wish to live or die.\u201d Han Sen carried himself in a menacing way.\n\nYaksha said, \u201cI\u2019m a king spirit. Do you really think I am afraid of death?\u201d\n\nHan Sen replied, \u201cTell me; what happened between the eight generals and Ancient Devil Emperor? If your answer satisfies my curiosity, I will let you live. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll play a game called, let\u2019s see if the king spirit can resurrect.\u201d\n\nYaksha\u2019s face turned grim, and he said, \u201cHow can I know you\u2019ll free me if I tell you what you want to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t promise I would, but I\u2019m not too concerned about a weakling like you. I can kill you on a whim, so the ball is indefinitely in your court. What happens next is entirely up to you.\u201d Han Sen left the Cruel Bottle to give him time to think.\n\nAfter this, he freed Moment Queen as well. Now that Han Sen was much stronger, there was little to fear. And what\u2019s more, he might have need of her knowledge soon.\n\n\u201cThis is your last chance,\u201d Han Sen told her.\n\n\u201cHow do I use this thing?\u201d Han Sen wondered, as he eyed the Aqua Core he held.\n\nMoment Queen said it would only work for spirits, so Han Sen had to weigh whether or not there was danger in taking it himself. After all, opening ten gene locks would be a remarkable thing."
