    "text": "At this point the SK series had become a synonym for high-end warframes. Han Sen had also become quite a celebrity among the unevolved.\n\nIn Steel Armor Shelter, Yang Manli widened her eyes, glaring at Han Sen. \"Why? Why would you want to refuse to Digang\u2019s new warframe SK Wolf?\"\n\nYang Manli could not begin to understand that. Digang had offered Han Sen excellent conditions for him to endorse their new four-legged warframe SK Wolf, but Han Sen had turned their offer down.\n\nIn the view of Yang Manli, Han Sen was just arrogant. He thought he had become a big star after shooting a commercial.\n\n\"Why did you turn it down?\" Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen and calmly asked.\n\n\"Endorsement could bring me a lot of wealth and popularity,\" Han Sen paused, and then continued, \"but my goal is not to become a big star, and this endorsement takes up too much of my time. I do not have time to be wasted on these things. SKTS was quite enough for now. Please explain on my behalf and turn down Digang\u2019s offer. I believe you would not want to see me failing the semiannual assessment either.\"\n\nQin Xuan smiled and said, \"Since you have decided, I will reply Digang and you can focus on other things.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain.\" Han Sen was glad that he was working for Qin Xuan, who was an admirable boss in every aspect.\n\nAfter Han Sen left, Yang Manli was very puzzled. She looked at Qin Xuan and said, \"Captain, why did you agree to let him turn down the endorsement? It would do him and the special squad good.\"\n\nQin Xuan grinned. \"An endorsement does not mean much. He has done quite enough. And he was right that the special squad does not need an expelled student.\"\n\n\"Do you really believe what he said?\" Yang Manli widened her eyes.\n\n\"He was exaggerating, but was right about one thing: if his own strength cannot keep up with his fame, then everything is just void. He really should not waste too much time on vanity.\" Qin Xuan Paused and said, \"Draft a document to turn down Digang\u2019s endorsement request, please.\"\n\nHan Sen was taking Wang Mengmeng to Devil Desert.\n\nIn order to get the S-Class license as soon as possible, Han Sen spared no effort to make Wang Mengmeng max out on all types of geno points other than the sacred ones.\n\nFortunately, Wang Mengmeng was resourceful, so it should not take too long.\n\nAnd he was not her only protector either. She would only ask him to accompany her to the extremely dangerous places like Devil Desert.\n\nThere were quite a lot of sacred-blood creatures in Devil Desert and Han Sen would like to take a chance and see if he could gain a sacred-blood weapon. If he could, then in the future, he would not have to run from the sacred-blood creatures like the silver bird, but could try to kill them.\n\nWang Mengmeng rarely went to school. The reason she had chosen Heavy Warframe Society was that there was no constraints there so that she could spend most of her time in God\u2019s Sanctuary. In addition to Han Sen, there were several other special squad members taking her out on hunting trips.\n\nCoupled with adequate advanced meat for her consumption, Wang Mengmeng improved fast. Currently she could fight a mutant creature alone.\n\nHan Sen leisurely followed Wang Mengmeng riding the mutant three-eyed beast, watching her fight. All he had to do was to summon the golden rock worm to clean up the creatures she had killed.\n\nNow Han Sen's targets were limited to mutant and sacred-blood creatures. However, Wang Mengmeng still needed some primitive geno points, so they were still hunting for rare primitive creatures.\n\n\"Brother Han, there seemed to be a group of creatures eyeing us from above,\" said Wang Mengmeng, sitting on the back of her big white bear.\n\n\"It has been a while. I wonder why they did not attack us.\" Han Sen nodded, as he had already noticed them.\n\nIt was a group of black-feathered beasts. They were primitive creatures with a monkey-like body and a pair of black wings.\n\nHan Sen had spotted them before. But they usually appeared in small groups instead of a large group like this. There were at least three dozen black-feathered beasts gathering in the sky right now.\n\nThese black-feathered beasts were hovering over them, but did not mean to attack. Han Sen had some doubts about this. Although they were intelligent, he did not believe that they could tell he and Wang were strong from their looks.\n\nWith so many of them, the beasts could have tried to attack.\n\nWhen Han Sen was wondering, he suddenly heard faint sounds of fighting ahead of them.\n\nThe two exchanged a look and urged their mounts up a dune. From there, they saw a group of people being attacked by thousands of black-feathered beasts, some of which were mutant creatures. Surrounded by black-feathered beasts, the group had no way to escape. They were fighting hard, but there were bodies of both the black-feathered beasts and humans on the sand.\n\n\"So these guys hovering over us are just the sentinels. No wonder they had not attacked us. We were never their goals.\" Han Sen was scared by how intelligent the creatures could be. They even had a strategy.\n\n\"That looks like Huangfu Pingqing. What\u2019s she doing here?\" Wang Mengmeng watched for a while and looked surprised, her eyes on a woman in red armor among the group of people.\n\n\"Huangfu Pingqing? Who is she?\" Han Sen paused as he had never heard such a name in Steel Armor Shelter. Judging from Wang\u2019s reaction, she seemed important.\n\n\"She is the daughter of Huangfu Hao. The Huangfus and Wangs have been friends for generations. We have been cooperating in many businesses. She is two years older than me, and has entered God\u2019s Sanctuary two years before I did. Her shelter should be Faith Shelter. Why would she be here?\" Wang Mengmeng asked, \"Brother Han, can we help them kill the creatures?\""
