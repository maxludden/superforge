    "text": "The sacred-blood black-feathered beast king tried to wiggle free, but was pinned back down by Han Sen. Growling, it did not struggle again.\n\nAs Han Sen was wondering why it had stopped, he saw the lights were disturbed by the beast king\u2019s growl and started to fly toward Han Sen and the beast king.\n\n\"What is that?\" Han Sen was shocked. After taking a closer look at them, he noticed that the lights were each a blue butterfly the size of his palm. Their blue wings were glistening.\n\nAnd soon the blue butterflies had reached them. only then did Han Sen know that the beast king was not here by accident. It was trying to use these butterflies to get rid of Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen became vigilant, and slashed at a butterfly before it could fall on him.\n\n\"Primitive creature ghost butterfly killed. No beast soul gained. Meat inedible.\"\n\nAs Han Sen was puzzled, he suddenly saw that dead ghost butterfly burst into blue flames.\n\nHan Sen rolled to the other side of the beast king and the flames fell on the beast king. It suddenly cried in pain, its fur burning.\n\nFlocks of ghost butterflies rushed over, hitting Han Sen and the beast king one after another. Once they were in collision, they would immediately burst into blue flames.\n\nThere were simply too many ghost butterflies and neither of them could many to avoid them.\n\nThe beast king growled from time to time from pain; although Han Sen\u2019s sacred-blood armor could protect him from burning, it could do nothing about the heat, and Han Sen was burned inside.\n\nHan Sen cursed the beast king inwardly. But at this point, he was in no mood to deal with it. Han Sen threw himself in the underground river, since otherwise he would become barbecued.\n\nAs Han Sen jumped into the underground river, the beast king followed him and jumped. It was very swift considering its size. With its wings folded, it swam downstream quickly.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and followed up. There were so many ghost butterfies, many of which were mutant creatures, generating great heat.\n\nBut the beast king was so fast that it almost disappeared from his sight. Han Sen would not like to see that and shot an arrow at it underwater. The arrow could not travel too far under water. Fortunately, Han Sen was not too far from the beast king. The black stinger arrow hit its wing and the thread attached to the arrow was entangled with its feathers.\n\nWhen the beast king moved forward, Han Sen was carried to go as well.\n\nIt was faster than a fish, pulling Han Sen forward.\n\n\"Is it an amphibian?\" Having followed the creature in the water for a while, Han Sen could no longer hold his breath. He had not evolved to the stage where he could breathe underwater, whereas the beast king seemed to be able to do that. Otherwise, it would have been out of breath by this time.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and summoned the black stinger arrow back, leaving the beast king alone and stuck his head out of the water to breathe.\n\nHe looked around and found himself in the cave still. There were still some ghost butterflies, but only several of them, staying still on the rocks and vines.\n\nSince he had lost the beast king and this place was not dangerous, Han Sen was in no hurry.\n\nLooking at a ghost butterfly on the rocks, Han Sen shot an arrow at it. With a pop, the butterfly turned into flames.\n\n\"Primitive creature ghost butterfly killed. Beast soul of primitive ghost butterfly gained. Meat inedible.\"\n\nHan Sen was thrilled. He had good luck today in terms of beast soul. Although it was merely a primitive beast soul, it was a one-off beast soul like the wasp arrow that Son of Heaven once used, which was generally more powerful than the beast souls on the same level. Generally speaking, the beast souls of these inedible creatures were all one-off.\n\nThe other ghost butterflies were alarmed and flew toward Han Sen. With his arrow, Han Sen soon managed to shoot them all dead. Blue flames bloomed in the air.\n\nAfter killing all the ghost butterflies, Han Sen climbed out from the water and started to review his trophy sitting on top of a rock.\n\nIn addition to the primitive ghost butterfly beast soul, he had also gained a primitive beast soul and a mutant beast soul from black-feathered beasts.\n\nType of primitive ghost butterfly beast soul: one-off hidden weapon.\n\nType of beast soul of primitive black-feathered beast: flying.\n\nType of beast soul of mutant black-feathered beast: flying.\n\nHan Sen saw the latter two and became overjoyed. There were so few creatures near his shelter that would produce flying beast souls that few people had wings in the entire Steel Armor Shelter.\n\nThese black-feathered beasts actually produced flying beast souls, which was great. He needed the wings himself as well, since he could only use the purple-winged dragon wings when he was Dollar.\n\nHan Sen only regretted that he did not manage to kill the sacred-blood beast king, otherwise he would have a chance to get another pair of sacred-blood wings.\n\n\"I need to go back and kill a few more black-feathered beasts. Even the primitive flying beast souls could be sold at a good price, since many youths would buy them just for the look.\"\n\nHan Sen summoned the ghost butterfly beast soul, and suddenly a blue butterfly flew into his palm, changing into a butterfly-shaped boomerang.\n\nThe two wings of the weapon were thin and sharp, looking rather scary.\n\nHan Sen threw the butterfly boomerang out, which whirled in the air and came toward Han Sen."
