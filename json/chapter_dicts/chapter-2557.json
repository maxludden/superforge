She was weak, and she couldn\u2019t outrun the giant demon centipede. The centipede caught up within seconds.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er held Littleflower as she dashed away, but the skies suddenly turned dark. An enormous shadow fell over the ground. Without looking up, she knew the giant demon centipede\u2019s mouth was hanging agape over their heads.\n\n\u201cWhy am I this unlucky? Does God envy smart people or something? Or is it because I, Tang Ming\u2019er, am simply too smart?\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er thought to herself. It could be said that her disposition was gloomy, and that was putting it lightly.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er was still pulling Littleflower\u2019s hands as she ran. Seeing the open mouth of the giant demon centipede drawing close behind her, she threw Littleflower forward.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d she shouted.\n\nSeeing that scary mouth draw so close, Tang Ming\u2019er felt like she was about to dissolve in fear. After all, she was an underage girl. She kind of looked like Tang Zhenliu, but she had never encountered a near-death experience before. So, she was afraid.\n\nSeeing the giant demon centipede mouth about to eat her, Tang Ming\u2019er\u2019s vision turned blurry. Then, she saw the giant demon centipede\u2019s head hit the ground near her. Soil and grass sprayed everywhere. The creature\u2019s head was inside a crater, and the boy with red lips and white teeth was standing atop the creature\u2019s body.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er\u2019s eyes opened wide. She stared at the boy upon the giant demon centipede\u2019s head. It was the boy she had been carrying moments before.\n\n\u201cBig Sister, are you okay?\u201d Han Littleflower walked over to Tang Ming\u2019er, looking worried.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er had no clue how to compose herself. She just stared at Han Littleflower in utter shock. No other response came to mind.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t believe this boy, who looked a few years younger than she was herself, was standing on top of a sacred-blood giant demon centipede. He made it look so easy.\n\n\u201cBig Sister, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Han Littleflower saw that Tang Ming\u2019er had frozen. He thought she was injured. He placed his hands on her forehead, preparing to inject power into her body and see where she might be hurt.\n\nBoom!\n\nAs this happened, the giant demon centipede struggled to pull its head out of the soil. Tang Ming\u2019er was scared again. She fell back.\n\n\u201cYou scared Big Sister! Go apologize.\u201d Han Littleflower turned around and glared at the giant demon centipede.\n\nThe giant demon centipede\u2019s body shivered and shook. As Tang Ming\u2019er watched with unbelieving eyes, the giant demon centipede lowered its body. It kept nodding toward Tang Ming\u2019er as if it was begging for forgiveness.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 what is going on? Am I dreaming? Is this really the sacred-blood creature known as a giant demon centipede?\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er was frozen.\n\n\u201cBig Sister! Are you okay?\u201d Han Littleflower ran in front of Tang Ming\u2019er again and placed his hands on her forehead.\n\nTang Ming\u2019er\u2019s face blushed. She fell back and looked at him. \u201cWho are you? No, are you human? Why would a demon centipede listen to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Han Littleflower, and I am human. Didn\u2019t I already tell you this?\u201d He pointed at the giant demon centipede and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t beat me. Of course he listens to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Littleflower\u2026 Your surname is Han? Are you related to Uncle Han Sen?\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er quickly asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his son. Have you seen my Dad?\u201d Upon hearing his dad\u2019s name get spoken, Littleflower became immeasurably happy.\n\n\u201cYou are Uncle Han\u2019s son? In that case, no wonder you can do this. My grandfather said anything can happen to the Han family, and that is because the Han family is so weird.\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er\u2019s eyes were wide as she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe my grandfather\u2019s words. I thought I was a genius, but you are so young and already this strong? What he was saying had to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Sister, where are you going? I can take you where you need to go,\u201d Han Littleflower said.\n\n\u201cTake me? How would you take me?\u201d Tang Ming\u2019er asked.\n\nHan Littleflower took Tang Ming\u2019er by the hand. He guided her over to the demon centipede\u2019s head. Then, he pulled out a blanket from his bag. He asked Tang Ming\u2019er to sit down on it. He brought out some fruit for her.\n\nAs the sun was setting, the giant demon centipede ran across the fields. Atop it was a boy and a young woman. The demon centipede ran fast, but it carefully maintained its stability to avoid disrupting the two it carried. It looked as if it was struggling to do that, though.\n\nIf the demon centipede was able to talk, it would probably have been crying something along the lines of, \u201cGee! Why am I so unlucky?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen gulped down another King class xenogeneic gene. He had one hundred King class xenogeneic genes.\n\n\u201cI wonder how soon I\u2019ll be able to become half-deified,\u201d Han Sen mumbled to himself. He wanted to upgrade his Dongxuan Area.\n\nAt the same time, in the core area, no one dared to provoke him. He was depending on Consume and Big Destroyed to eat his King xenogeneic genes. His Dongxuan Area had reached the ninth tier. He only needed one more rank to transcend King class and become a half-deified being.\n\nUnfortunately, Han Sen was disappointed. Despite having one hundred King genes, his Dongxuan Area was refusing to level up.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I need my power to break through the ninth tier and have it all return to one to become half-deified.\u201d Han Sen had already guessed this might happen. Setting aside his disappointment, he used those one hundred King xenogeneic genes to level up Jadeskin instead.\n\nRight now, Han Sen was looking very annoyed. The rate at which he was consuming his amassed genes was far outpacing the speed at which he was able to hunt more creatures and replenish his stock. His reserves were being depleted.\n\nThe core area had many King xenogeneics, but the place was so big that it took forever to travel between destinations. It could take him several days to find a single King xenogeneic.\n\nFor an ordinary King, that might have been a decent time. But for someone like Han Sen, that wasn\u2019t nearly quick enough. He needed a shortcut.\n\n\u201cNo, I must find more King xenogeneic genes,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. And as he spoke to himself, his mind started to rummage through a trove of different ideas that might enable him to collect vast swathes of King xenogeneic genes all at once.\n\nThe fastest way would be to hunt deifieds with Dragon One or someone else again. But if there really was a deified creature about, Han Sen would have preferred to kill it himself. Helping others wouldn\u2019t really be worth it.\n\nAs Han Sen thought deeply about this problem, someone came hurrying over. The person moved in front of him to block his way.\n\n\u201cBarr?\u201d When Han Sen saw Barr, he suddenly felt a headache coming on. He wasn\u2019t afraid; he just thought the man was annoying.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, I\u2019m going to lay it down straight for you. I want you to bless me. I can give you anything your heart desires in return for this,\u201d Barr said, upon stopping in front of him.\n\n\u201cOkay. How about two thousand King xenogeneic genes?\u201d Han Sen suggested, staring at Barr.\n\nBarr was taken aback. Two thousand King xenogeneic genes was a big number."
