    "text": "Night River King shouldn\u2019t have stayed that close to Han Sen. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s attack wouldn\u2019t have been so potent if the distance between them had been greater. At such close range, Night River King had tried to attack Han Sen without reserving any of his strength for defense. His King class body was unable to withstand the noise unleashed by the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.\n\nThe sound of the drum was like the sting of a scorpion tail, jabbing directly into his brain. Thinking suddenly became very difficult, and he felt as if his head was going to explode. Gathering the willpower necessary for the smallest action became almost impossible.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s hand kept pounding the Jade Drum in a simple rhythm.\n\nDong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Every beat of the rhythm felt like a thick needle being driven deeper into Night River King\u2019s skull. He clutched his head and screamed aloud. He couldn\u2019t control his body, and so he started to fall.\n\nThe booming of the drum echoed through the sky. It hit the gold Bai Sema, but the shield blocked it. The noise couldn\u2019t hurt Han Yan and the others, who were still safely ensconced in the shield.\n\nHan Sen followed along with the rhythm to slash Night River King. The powerful beats of the drum didn\u2019t affect him.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s blood, which possessed the power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, had sunk deep into the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. Although he couldn\u2019t totally control the Jade Drum yet, some of his blood had merged into the Blood Scorpion. A connection was beginning to form between the two.\n\nThe Blood Scorpion believed Han Sen was a part of it, so it had decided not to hurt him.\n\nHan Sen wielded his knife like a ravaging demon. He stood directly over Night River King and slashed the Rebate\u2019s neck over and over. The knife let out a shrieking metal noise every time it struck, and a light mark began to split the neck.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t Night River King\u2019s biggest problem. Bao\u2019er\u2019s drum went on and on, and as long as it continued to beat, Night River King would be unable to fight back. He clutched his head, and he was soon bleeding from every orifice.\n\nHan Sen kept striking the same spot, making the wound a little larger with every blow. The purple knife air was scarier than ever.\n\nIf one slash didn\u2019t work, then a hundred slashes were sure to. If a hundred slashes didn\u2019t work, though, then it would take a thousand slashes. It didn\u2019t matter how tough Night River King\u2019s body was; he would have a limit, and Han Sen would find it. Night River King wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand those cuts forever.\n\nAn ordinary Marquise couldn\u2019t even cut the skin of a King, but Han Sen\u2019s knife air was so strong that he could destroy far more than a normal Marquise could. Not even Dukes could compete with him.\n\nAnd Teeth powers also had a tearing force. As Han Sen slashed the wound, he let that teeth power build up. The purple wound became deeper and deeper, while the tearing force became stronger and stronger.\n\nBai Wei was still standing inside the Bai Sema. She watched as Han Sen began cutting into Night River King\u2019s neck, as the blood began to spill. The scene left her speechless.\n\nHan Sen had given her many surprises, and he had proven himself to possess both confidence and a fine sense of judgment. He had a shield that could withstand the blow of a deified enemy, and on top of that, he had a Jade Drum that could leave a King class elite dazed and disoriented. All of Han Sen\u2019s possessions made the Extreme King queen jealous.\n\nIf Bai Wei wanted a King or deified weapon, she could get them easily.\n\nBut having such a weapon would matter little. She was just a Marquise, and she couldn\u2019t utilize the full powers of a deified weapon. It would be pointless for her to have one.\n\nHowever, Han Sen\u2019s tri-colored shield could be used by a Marquise, and it could block deified attacks. It was difficult to imagine what sort of treasure that was.\n\nBai Wei recognized the Jade Drum, too. Even though the Jade Drum was King class, she couldn\u2019t strike the Jade Drum in the same way Bao\u2019er was able to. She could never deliver such an impact against a King class opponent.\n\nEven more frightening, the person using the Jade Drum to unleash such devastating attacks was just a child. She looked like a five-year-old kid.\n\nHan Sen kept slashing, and eventually, Night River King\u2019s neck was cut open. Blood spilled out freely, and even the bone was marked by his blows.\n\nHan Sen slashed at it endlessly. The Teeth power was sinking in the bone, ripping at it. Marks covered the bone now.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen slashed again, and his Ghost Teeth Knife split the bone open. Night River King\u2019s head dangled.\n\nNight River King had been dazed by the drum, and he couldn\u2019t fight back. Blood trailed from his eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nHan Sen waved for Bao\u2019er to stop hitting the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum. He looked at the half-dead Night River King. \u201cWho sent you to kill me?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe Night River King had the pull to come to Planet Ice Blue and attempt to assassinate him alone. If Night River King owned the Ancient God statuette, he wouldn\u2019t have saved it for that day.\n\nNight River King had wanted to kill Han Sen long before they left with the Extreme King.\n\nHan Sen already knew the answer, but he still wanted to confirm it.\n\nNight River King\u2019s neck was in the process of breaking, and the Teeth powers were tearing ever deeper into the wound. As his grievous wounds deepened, he lay on the ground, completely immobile. His face was bleeding, and his eyes were starting to close.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 kill\u2026 me\u2026\u201d Night River King\u2019s eyes turned white as he mumbled. He had blood leaking out of his mouth, so his words were garbled.\n\n\u201cWho sent you to kill me?\u201d Han Sen repeated his question.\n\n\u201cIn\u2026 Inspector\u2026 Don\u2019t kill me\u2026\u201d Night River King\u2019s words were clear enough to remove all doubt.\n\nUpon hearing what the man said, Han Sen just slashed. He severed Night River King\u2019s neck that was still being devoured by his Teeth power.\n\nNight River King\u2019s head rolled away. A King class elite had been killed.\n\nHan Sen had needed to know who was behind all of this, but no good would come from keeping Night River King alive. His word alone wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to take down Edward.\n\nEdward might have had more opportunity to distort the truth if Night River King was left alive. Saving Night River King would have been possible.\n\nAfter killing Night River King, Han Sen looted the corpse. There were two King class Moon Wheel Blades to take, and a bunch of other things as well. But these weren\u2019t beast souls that could go in his Sea of Soul; Han Sen had to physically carry them. He was already carrying many of his own things, so there was a limit to how much he could take.\n\nThe two Moon Wheel Blades had to be extraordinarily expensive. He should be able to swap them and some of the other items for King class xenogeneic genes.\n\nAfter killing Night River King, Han Sen couldn\u2019t search anymore. So, he destroyed the camera and took Night River King\u2019s body back to base.\n\nHan Sen blamed Night River King for destroying the camera, and that excuse managed to save him a lot of trouble.\n\nIce Blue Knight King was enraged upon Han Sen\u2019s return. It wasn\u2019t because Night River King had sought to kill Han Sen, though; he was angry because Bai Wei had almost been killed."
