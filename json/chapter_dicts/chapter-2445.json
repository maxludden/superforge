    "text": "\u201cMister Quin, why are we not going to the White River System? We seem to be headed for Tianxia System instead.\u201d An Extreme King knight looked Bao Quin with confusion.\n\n\u201cThe White River System is currently in turmoil. Interstellar pirates are everywhere there. It might seem easy for Han Sen to slip through the chaos, but it is a very populated place. Han Sen has a bold personality, so it most likely compelled him to go to the Tianxia System,\u201d Bao Quin deduced tonelessly.\n\n\u201cBut he is just a King. Tianxia System isn\u2019t a feasible route for someone of his level,\u201d the knight said after a moment of thought.\n\n\u201cBefore he was exposed, no one would have believed he had the gall to disguise himself as a prince of the Extreme King,\u201d Bao Quin responded, his eyes hard.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cSlow down!\u201d Bao\u2019er was pushing the white whale through the clouds at an insane speed. Although their transport could move very quickly, it was supposed to be a whale, not a fighter jet. Ning Yue was lying on the floor, clutching a chair while bawling her eyes out. Her face was covered in tears and snot.\n\nHan Sen peered out at the endless clouds, and he couldn\u2019t help but frown.\n\nAlthough he already knew that the Tianxia System was dangerous, seeing the system with his own eyes had still taken him aback.\n\nTianxia System\u2019s clouds extended in all directions like an ocean, making it hard for Han Sen to keep his sense of direction. The endless clouds were colorful, as if the white whale was surrounded by countless fluffy rainbows. The clouds were opaque enough that it was difficult to see beyond the closest layer.\n\nNow, Han Sen and his companions were traveling through blue clouds. They were endless, and they were scarier than the depths of the sea. In between the moving clouds, Han Sen could occasionally see cloud beasts dancing.\n\nThose crane-like cloud beasts were in flocks of several thousand. They flew together like a cloud of their own, all moving quickly in tandem.\n\nInside the blue clouds, they would sometimes see the flash of magnetic storms. Typically, tools and gadgets were rendered useless by such storms. But fortunately, the big white whale of the crystallizers wasn\u2019t affected by powerful magnetic interference. The turbulence of the storm\u2019s had no effect on the white whale, which was why Han Sen wasn\u2019t afraid to go through the Tianxia System.\n\nThe white whale was like a deified creature, but it had no lifeforce. Because of that, it didn\u2019t send out a lifeforce for others to sniff out. Ordinary xenogeneics wouldn\u2019t attack it, and Han Sen had indeed seen many xenogeneics along the way. But most of them completely ignored the white whale. Some of the meaner ones tried to attack the white whale, but they couldn\u2019t really damage the hull of the ship.\n\nAside from the cloud beasts, they rarely saw other elites in the system. Even those of the higher races rarely came to hunt here. It was way too dangerous, and it was almost never worth the risk.\n\nPang!\n\nAs the white whale blazed along, an explosion sounded off to the side. The clouds rumbled and rolled, sort of like a tsunami. It felt as if some terrifying creatures were in the middle of a war somewhere in the fog.\n\nHan Sen told Bao\u2019er to go past whatever it was. After all, they were running for their lives, not going on a safari. It was best not to attract the attention of anything, and so they should focus on getting through the fog as fast as possible.\n\nBut before Bao\u2019er turned the white whale, a few people flew out of the big clouds. Terror was written across their faces, and they appeared to be running for their lives.\n\nTheir worries meant nothing to Han Sen. He didn\u2019t have time to worry about people who were running for their lives. But when he got close enough to see their faces, Han Sen jerked back in surprise.\n\nAmidst the shadows, there were two pretty women that looked like twins. One was Gu Qingcheng, and the other was Elysian Moon.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t just ignore them. He had Bao\u2019er drive the white whale over to Gu Qingcheng.\n\nWhen the people saw the white whale heading toward them, they turned in another direction, trying desperately to get away from this new threat as well. But soon after, they saw the mouth of the white whale open. Someone emerged through the gap.\n\n\u201cQingcheng, why are you here?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.\n\nGu Qingcheng saw Han Sen, and so she flew towards him with Elysian Moon. When the others saw that Gu Qingcheng and Han Sen seemed to know each other, they looked relieved. They flew over to the white whale, as well.\n\n\u201cThere are deified creatures ahead. We should leave this place,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said to Han Sen after flying over there.\n\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d Han Sen led the way. He invited Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon into the white whale. The other people followed Gu Qingcheng, entering the white whale as well.\n\nSeeing that Gu Qingcheng knew them, Han Sen made no effort to stop their entry.\n\n\u201cThis is a battleship? And it can sail through the Tianxia System? This is so weird,\u201d said a twenty-year-old man. He was one of the Demon, and he had deep purple horns. He looked around the big white whale with great curiosity.\n\nHan Sen told Bao\u2019er to drive the white whale away from the deified creatures. Then he looked at the people who had followed Gu Qingcheng aboard and asked, \u201cWho are they?\u201d\n\nThere were a dozen of them, and they were all from different races. They were mostly Dukes and Kings. Gu Qingcheng pointed at one of the young Feather men.\n\n\u201cHe hired Elysian Moon and me to protect him inside Tianxia System.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the Feather man. The man seemed very young, and his lifeforce wasn\u2019t that strong. He was a Marquise or Duke, at best.\n\n\u201cMy name is Qing Yu. Thank you for saving me. What is your name?\u201d the Feather man asked politely.\n\n\u201cHan Sen.\u201d Han Sen had no plans of hiding his identity.\n\n\u201cYou are the student of the newly deified Knife Queen? I have heard your name before,\u201d Fang Qing Yu said, glancing curiously over Han Sen.\n\nSurprisingly, Fang Qing Yu wasn\u2019t like the other Feathers. All of the rest of the Feathers hated Han Sen.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw that they had no reaction to his name, he figured that they hadn\u2019t heard that he was wanted by the Extreme King.\n\nIt made sense. Equipment didn\u2019t work inside the Tianxia System, so contacting the outside world would have been impossible. They didn\u2019t know what had happened out there.\n\nHan Sen looked outside and noticed there were no more crazy clouds. They must be far away from the deified xenogeneic now.\n\n\u201cThis place should be safe. You can leave,\u201d Han Sen said, turning to Fang Qing Yu.\n\nFang Qing Yu quietly responded, \u201cBrother Han, I would like you to take me all the way through the Tianxia System. What would require in trade for such a request?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not here to play games, and I\u2019m not interested in a business deal. Please get off my ship,\u201d Han Sen said firmly.\n\nHe was on the lam. He wasn\u2019t interested in spending any more time with these people. He had only saved them because Gu Qingcheng was there.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, please consider it. Tell me how much you want, and I will gladly play you,\u201d Fang Qing Yu said.\n\n\u201cSorry, I am a little busy. I cannot take you guys,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cListen, buddy! You\u2019re going to end up embarrassing yourself.\u201d One of the Destroyed stepped forward from behind Fang Qing Yu. He glared at Han Sen as he spoke.\n\nOther Dukes and Kings slowly surrounded them, too."
