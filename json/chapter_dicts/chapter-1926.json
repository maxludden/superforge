    "text": "Fortunately, now that he was a student of someone who was half-deified, Han Sen had some level of authority across Narrow Moon. It gave him access to information that the ordinary Rebates were not permitted to know.\n\nHan Sen could not find out anything about the origin of the red mist orb, but he was able to learn about the red mist minks and the Red Mist King.\n\nIn the geno universe, there was a race called Meka. In truth, it wasn\u2019t one fixed race, but a title that included a number of subspecies and different blood lineages. So, because of their extreme diversity, the Meka couldn\u2019t be considered a higher race like the Feathers were. Even if their strength exceeded that of some higher races.\n\nEven if one of the Meka managed to light a geno lantern, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to enable all Meka to be considered a higher race; there were too many differences in the blood between them all.\n\nThe Meka\u2019s xenogeneic space included everything from pigs to snakes. There were still so many different types of creatures that were considered Meka that it was difficult to keep track of them all.\n\nBut there was one connecting thread, and that was a talent shared by all the Meka. They could consume xenogeneic genes and create a new material inside their own bodies.\n\nThe Meka used these materials to create xenogeneic battle bodies, creations that were similar to the Red Mist King.\n\nBut in order to be used, xenogeneic battle bodies required a power that belonged solely to the Meka. So, if you were not one of the Meka, and you had a xenogeneic battle body, you would not be able to operate it.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, those little minks belong to the Meka. They\u2019re related in some way, leastways. But if that\u2019s the case, then why were they born here? And why was the Red Mist King here? The Meka need a lot of xenogeneic genes to create xenogeneic battle bodies, and the red mist spring had a lot of spring water. That means many xenogeneics died here. These two have to be related in some way,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nBut this was all he could conjecture. He couldn\u2019t make any further guesses, as the information he had discovered did not talk about the red mist minks and the Red Mist King specifically.\n\nHan Sen tried to use xenogeneic gene ingredients to fill up the Red Mist King\u2019s energy, but he soon realized that it wasn\u2019t working.\n\nThis was because xenogeneic genes had to be eaten by the red mist minks, who would then release the energy they had gained. That was the top-up process for the Red Mist King. The red mist minks were too small right now, however, so they couldn\u2019t eat much. And they were also slow to generate energy.\n\nHan Sen let them eat as many Baron xenogeneic genes as they were capable. But by doing so, they were only able to generate 0.01% percent of the needed energy each day. And that was with all seven of them working together. God only knew how long it would take for the batteries to fill up.\n\nHan Sen discovered that Red Mist King\u2019s planet\u2014the one they had gone to\u2014belonged to the Meka\u2019s xenogeneic space. Red Mist King\u2019s arrival had been a big event for the Meka, and there was a lot of news coverage on it.\n\nHan Sen was happy he had managed to get out of there quickly. If the Meka King class sorts found him, he didn\u2019t know if he could have made it out alive.\n\nPlanet Eclipse had been quiet for a while. After a few days, Black Steel sent him a message inviting him to Planet Black- Moon to observe a ceremony. The ceremony was about forging a knife. The knife was forged already, so this was more of an opening ceremony for the weapon.\n\nThe Black family wouldn\u2019t invite others if it was an ordinary knife, but this was different. Black-Moon King had spent a hundred years to forge a King class knife. And that was why he wished to arrange a ceremony that others could attend.\n\nNot just anyone was qualified to watch, either. Most of the invites were sent to King class elites. A few lower level subordinates could follow after their Kings, but they weren\u2019t allowed to be there when the ceremony was taking place.\n\nNo other Viscounts like Han Sen received a direct invitation, and only three or four Dukes received a direct invite. They were Black-Moon King\u2019s friends.\n\nAlthough Han Sen was not particularly interested in attending a ceremony, Yisha told him that Black-Moon King was going out of his way to include Han Sen. Black-Moon King had always spoken positively about Han Sen, so he had no qualms in agreeing to the invite and going.\n\nOn the day of the ceremony, Black-Moon King called for a spacecraft to collect Han Sen. Yisha also received an invitation, but she wasn\u2019t going, so Han Sen had to go alone.\n\nWhen he reached Planet Black-Moon, Black Steel invited Han Sen to join him in watching the ceremony. Han Sen realized he was sitting in the same spot Yisha was supposed to.\n\nThat also meant he was sitting next to Moon Wheel King and a few of the other Kings. Rebecca and Qing Li could only stand someplace in the back, as they hadn\u2019t been honored with seats.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t very concerned about the situation, though. He had seen too much in his lifetime, so paltry things like social awkwardness no longer bothered him. He simply acted cool while he drank his tea. He wasn\u2019t unnerved by the proximity of Moon Wheel King and the others.\n\nBut the Kings took tiers seriously. To them, Han Sen was a small fry, so there was no need to converse with him. That meant no one talked to Han Sen.\n\nHalf an hour later, no one had yet seen Black-Moon King or the King class weapon he was supposed to present. Just as Han Sen was wondering when the event was going to begin, Black-Moon King appeared atop the peak of a stone mountain.\n\nHan Sen was surprised, and he thought, \u201cI thought this was a ceremony. What is he doing up a mountain?\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King smiled and said, \u201cThat stony mountain is a whetstone. It is a xenogeneic gene from a King class rocky giant. A long time ago, a King of the Black family slew it. And ever since, they have used it as a whetstone. When a King class weapon is forged, it is revealed here. This is the third time I have seen this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre King class weapons that hard to forge?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. The Black family had a long history, but after all that time, they had only managed to forge three?\n\nMoon Wheel King smiled. \u201cNot exactly. The Black family has forged more than three King class weapons, but those were mostly created from creatures. They don\u2019t show them off. Only King class weapons that are created entirely by the Black family\u2019s hands will have a ceremony.\u201d\n\nAfter a while, Moon Wheel King said, \u201cThis ceremony is special. Black-Moon King is taking this very seriously. The weapon is named after Narrow Moon.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was curious about this. He wondered what sort of knife would be granted the title of Narrow Moon. Narrow Moon was as big as the Rebate themselves were. The blade had to be special to be named after it."
