Of course I have; it destroyed both Ruin Emperor and No God Emperor. The human has been expanding the reach of his territory following that, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder what powers he practiced to be able to do what he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard some spirits have tried to resist him and have refused to pledge their allegiance to the man when he came to their shelters. Needless to say, they were quickly struck down. He\u2019s merciless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it goes on like this, he\u2019ll soon end up claiming the entirety of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou worry far too much, far too soon. It won\u2019t be as easy for him as he thinks. He is a human, and those who accompany him are spirits and creatures. He treats them well, but when he claims a shelter, the spirit that previously owned the place is put under a contract with one of his close allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as an invincible foe; powers have a limit. There must be some way we can fight back and break him. Undead Emperor and The King still haven\u2019t tried their hands yet. Undead Emperor never dies, and The King has an incredible amount of power, or at least he did, last we saw him. If he had ten gene locks open, he might be able to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jump the gun just yet. I\u2019m sure it will still take The King some time before he opens his tenth gene lock.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and I both know The King is vastly different than most spirits. He is delightfully unpredictable, and it would not surprise me if he already had opened his tenth gene lock.\u201d\n\nAs they spoke, a new island appeared at the spirit base.\n\nThe king spirits looked over to see who was coming, and it was the person they had just been discussing: Han Sen. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t recognize him as such.\n\nThe king spirits drove their island towards Han Sen and asked him, \u201cThe King, have you heard about the human?\u201d\n\nHan Sen took a moment before responding, thinking to himself, \u201cWell, duh. That\u2019s me, you numpties!\u201d\n\nOf course, he was far politer to them than that when he spoke. And wanting to have some fun, he smiled and told them, \u201cThat is why I am here. I need to open my tenth gene lock as soon as possible, so I can kill him.\u201d\n\nThe spirits were enthusiastic, hearing this. They immediately said, \u201cYou can break Super Spank?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have Skill Negation. To fight and destroy the boy, all I need is my tenth gene lock to be open,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHow do you plan on opening it? You can\u2019t take too long!\u201d a king spirit asked.\n\n\u201cI need to fight to open it, and I need all sorts of spirit geno points,\u201d Han Sen feigned.\n\n\u201cI have water element! I can give you those points so you can kill the human,\u201d one king spirit offered.\n\n\u201cYeah, I do need some. It would be wonderful to receive some of those!\u201d Han Sen was thrilled, for he had played them like a fiddle. This was exactly what he had come to do, and they had fallen for his bait, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nIt was normally difficult to gather king spirit geno points, and he could only receive one point for each kill.\n\nPlus, the last time he had come here, king spirits tended to avoid him. They didn\u2019t like his pompous attitude, and neither did they like the fact he\u2019d always one-hit kill them. Now, they thought they needed him, so their tunes had changed.\n\nKing spirits began to line up, one after each other. They were all dying to give him their geno points so he could challenge Han Sen. And the offerings weren\u2019t measly, either. They often gave more than just a handful.\n\nThis was the ninth spirit base, so the king spirits around often possessed nine hundred geno points. Maxing out the figure to one hundred would not be too difficult for him.\n\n\u201cI have thunder geno points! I will give you as many as you need, but please kill the human.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too!\u201d\n\nThe queue was a messy one, as spirits impatiently wished to provide The King all the geno points they could offer.\n\n\u201cI will take your earth geno points. There is no need for more fire. But I also need someone to help me practice in combat.\u201d\n\nAs Han Sen watched his king spirit geno point tally steadily increase, he was exuberantly happy. Every now and again, Han Sen came to the spirit base to collect a few points where he could and practice combat.\n\nHe had never been beaten, for he utterly annihilated all his challengers with the greatest of ease. It was for this particular reason the spirits believed The King would be the person to beat Han Sen.\n\nAnd before long, his king spirit geno points were maxing out, one after each other, element after element.\n\nHan Sen was now able to maximize his efficiency with wind, fire, thunder, and lightning. He wasn\u2019t as effective with them as he would be if he was a professional that trained with one element exclusively, but he was nothing to laugh at.\n\nThe reason Han Sen wanted to collect and better his elemental powers so much, though, was because of his desire to hammer out new, complex hyper geno arts. And that was what was great about humanity.\n\nHan Sen was in a fine, cheery mood, but the spirits around weren\u2019t. They had no idea Han Sen was The King and The King was Han Sen.\n\nHe initially feared encountering Sky King or the lady with Serpent Throne, but fortunately for him, they did not show up. If they did, he believed they could expose him. They had seen Han Sen don the appearance of The King when he activated super king spirit mode.\n\nThat being said, they had ten gene locks open. And once Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit mode opened its tenth gene lock, the chance of having an awkward encounter with them was far higher.\n\nAs long as he kept away from them, and they could not see The King\u2019s appearance, Han Sen wagered he\u2019d be fine.\n\nHan Sen hoped they had never even heard of The King, but that might have been unlikely. At the very least, he hoped they didn\u2019t like spending time in the spirit base.\n\nHe didn\u2019t think many people would believe them, though, even if they did try to expose The King as being Han Sen. It was a stretch to believe, and it\u2019d be his word against theirs.\n\nPlus, it wasn\u2019t as if they could challenge him. He had maxed out his geno points, too."
