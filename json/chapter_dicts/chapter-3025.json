    "text": "Lone Bamboo drew his sword. He was going into the sky.\n\nThere was a sudden movement in space. A powerful bai sema trapped the area. Lone Bamboo tried slashing the bai sema. Since there were light shadows, the strike was unable to break the barrier.\n\n\u201cTeacher, let me out! I need to bring Wan\u2019er back!\u201d Lone Bamboo looked confident as he spoke.\n\nSky Palace Leader\u2019s voice echoed through the bai sema. \u201cEverything will turn into nothing in the end. If you can understand the true meaning of the Textless Book, you can make that bai sema fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWan\u2019er!\u201d Lone Bamboo was as angry as a wild flame. He kept striking the bai sema, but the bai sema looked as if it could absorb any power thrown at it. Lone Bamboo\u2019s strong sword was unable to break the bai sema at all.\n\nIn front of the geno hall, Qin Xiu calmly looked at God. In his eyes, the appearance and body were not important. He could see that it was God.\n\n\u201cGod, the reason I lost before was because of this world restraining me,\u201d Qin Xiu coldly said. \u201cNow, my body has earned the approval of this world. You and I are on the same level now. It is time to bring this to an end.\u201d\n\nGod stood before the geno hall. He calmly looked at Qin Xiu and said, \u201cYou have already lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Then, you must tell me where and how I lost.\u201d Qin Xiu looked at God with interest.\n\nGod smiled and said, \u201cI still remember that proud Sacred Leader Qin Xiu once saying he would become the leader of the world even if he had to go against the whole world. Now, you have given into the world. You might be able to beat me, but you have already lost.\u201d\n\nQin Xiu seriously said, \u201cYes. I have already lost. I wanted to use the origin of genes to make genes that were greater than the genes of the gods. That way, I could be on top of the world. In the end, though, I lost. That was almost impossible. So, I took a step back. I used my body to combine with god genes. I am half-human and half-god. I can keep my power and be accepted by the world.\u201d\n\nEven as he spoke, Qin Xiu\u2019s eyes had yet to move. He still looked confident as he said, \u201cNone of that matters anymore. Even if I were to use all the bad methods of the world, and even though I am hated by call creatures, it is just this body that is lost. All of that does not matter as long as I can fulfill my wish. Even if I turn to dust, it will have been worth it.\u201d\n\nGod asked. \u201cWould you let others suffer for your own benefit? Is that truly worth it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind having a thousand crimes on me because my mind is stalwart.\u201d Qin Xiu\u2019s heart was as strong as steel. His mind would not be changed. He walked toward the geno hall.\n\nWith each footstep, it was like the whole sky and the world was suppressing the god palaces. In the god palaces that never broke, countless cracks were developing.\n\nThe god temples in the bottom cracked first. Some of the smaller temples fell away from the god palace collective.\n\n\u201cThe god palaces are starting to fall. This really is Sacred Leader Qin Xiu.\u201d Human King looked at the sky with much excitement.\n\n\u201cHan Jinzhi\u2019s prophecy came true,\u201d the red-clothed woman said. Her voice trembled with sheer excitement.\n\nSeeing Qin Xiu walk to the geno hall, the god palaces beneath his feet kept cracking and breaking. He looked like a big dragon cracking the god palaces. The god palaces kept breaking. It was like the end of the world.\n\nGod stood in front of the geno hall. He did not do anything. His body was glowing with serious holy light as he fought against Qin Xiu\u2019s power.\n\nGod\u2019s power could not stop Qin Xiu\u2019s approach. He only made his approach slower.\n\nQin Xiu kept walking as he said, \u201cIn this world, there are not many people I admire. You are one of them, but it is a shame you are bound by rules. What you can accomplish is limited. I exist beyond those rules now. I am not bound. I can do anything. We can tell who will win. Even you will lose today.\u201d\n\nThe god palaces fell, but God was still calm as he said, \u201cI do not think so. You cannot make something out of nothing. There must be rules, and rules breed possibilities. If everything was nothing, then nothing would exist. There would not be you and I. Things were always meant to be, and it cannot be forced.\u201d \u201cThe world is not fair. What do we need it for? If this world really required rules, then it should be me who decides them.\u201d Qin Xiu\u2019s eyes possessed god light. The black and white flames grew brighter. The blue pattern on the armor was glowing with a blue light. It was like they were coming alive.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nWhile Qin Xiu was suppressing the god palaces, more and more cracks developed. Although God tried his best to protect the geno hall, his power did not really do much to affect Qin Xiu.\n\nUnder Qin Xiu\u2019s suppression, his mouth was bleeding\n\nQin Xiu kept walking forward as he said, \u201cYour god body is limited by rules. You cannot fight me. You can only use your body to descend, but your body is too weak. Still, you must have selected this girl for a reason. Why don\u2019t you tell me what it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name is Wan\u2019er,\u201d God said.\n\nQin Xiu\u2019s body froze when he heard that name. He stopped walking. His eyes looked complicated for a brief moment and became clear again. He looked at God and said, \u201cThis Wan\u2019er is not the same Wan\u2019er I used to have. If you think you can use her to stop me, I must inform you that you are incorrect.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Qin Xiu walked forward again. He and God\u2019s powers were in constant collision. It made the god palaces fall like mad. Many god temples kept splitting away and flying into space. The entire construct of the god palaces was falling apart. Most of the god temples below were all scattered.\n\n\u201cNo, I just wanted to tell you that you are not the only one in this world with a family,\u201d God said.\n\n\u201cSo what? Even if the world has countless creatures, to me, there is only one person.\u201d Qin Xiu\u2019s determination could not be faltered. He continued slowly walking toward the god palaces.\n\nThe indestructible geno hall was shaking. Inside the god palace, every race\u2019s race lantern was shining extremely bright. They helped God fight against Qin Xiu.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nThe sky and ground were changing a lot. One Annihilation class god temple fell away from the god palaces. It drifted into the void of space.\n\nA sky full of races was incredibly shocked. When the god palaces were falling, everywhere in the universe suffered a disaster.\n\nThere were floods all over, and volcanos erupting. In space, magnetic storms were raging. Streams were messed up everywhere. It was like the end of the world. On the cold planet, Han Sen\u2019s eyes were burning with fire. His body kept shaking.\n\nHe knew Littleflower was inside the armor, but Qin Xiu\u2019s power was controlling it. It was like Wan\u2019er being possessed by God. It was still Littleflower, but another power had taken control of him.\n\nIf he was able to repel the power, he could save Littleflower. But Han Sen was still unable to learn how to be absolutely still. He had not yet learned to control the blue blood power.\n\n\u201cI cannot wait any longer. Littleflower is suppressed now, but Qin Xiu\u2019s power will only become stronger. Littleflower might be defeated on the inside.\u201d Han Sen knew he was running out of time. He had to take a risk. He cast Blood-Pulse Sutra and activated the blue blood power inside him."
