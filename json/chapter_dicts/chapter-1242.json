It roared and then entered the Cruel Bottle.\n\nHan Sen was delighted about this, so he put a lid on it. For the rhino, this was similar to humans taking refuge in the Alliance, away from the sanctuaries where the motions and terms of a contract were always in play. For the duration it was in the bottle, the rhino was safe.\n\nSaint Fan now couldn\u2019t kill the rhino for switching its allegiance, but if Han Sen wanted to enlist Holy Rhino as an ally in the future, he knew he\u2019d have to take down Saint Fan once and for all.\n\nUnfortunately for Han Sen, he could not yet kill Saint Fan. If anything, that frightening spirit was more powerful than ever. It was highly likely the rest of the super creatures inhabiting Saint Fan Shelter would be absorbed to become a part of him.\n\nSaint Fan must have known he had been poisoned, too. Han Sen couldn\u2019t waltz in and expect to play the same trick on him, as Saint Fan would have most likely deployed a precaution to avoid it happening again.\n\nThe Invisible Toxic King Scorpion glyph was a powerful item he had developed, but Han Sen still had to get in close and deal proper damage to the spirit to put the poisons to work. If Saint Fan had combined with a host of additional king spirits and super creatures, getting up close and personal would be harder than ever.\n\nStill, Han Sen could take solace in the fact that he and his people had each emerged from the battle as they had entered. Although his companions were weary, Han Sen had not lost a single one. Furthermore, the silver fox had come back to him. Of course, Han Sen acknowledged how terrifyingly close the situation had been to disaster before the furry thing had leaped in to save the day. If it hadn\u2019t come back at that precise moment, Saint Fan would have killed them all before the toxins took effect.\n\nAs evidenced by the delay that day, the toxins really did take a good amount of time to work on powerful foes. But, with the battle over, everyone returned to the shelter. Queen went straight back to practicing, as she had been unable to help at all in the fight.\n\nThere was a stark line between having a death wish and being willing to die in aid and service of others in the face of extreme adversity. Death was around the next corner, if she wished it to be, but a true cause to bring about death was a rarity.\n\nAfter this, though, she was given a renewed perspective. She could see the contrast between her and Han Sen\u2019s strength, and she had a better grasp on how much weaker she was and how much further she had to go if she wished to compete and be of help like the rest of his companions.\n\nHumans had only occupied the sanctuaries for two hundred years, while spirits and creatures had been there far longer. It was natural for humans to be weaker to begin with, and it was always difficult to find footing in each greater sanctuary.\n\nHan Sen was delighted to have the silver fox return, but the others weren\u2019t.\n\nThe silver fox had used its lightning to heal the wounds of Han Sen\u2019s, which had them all writhing on the ground in agony. They half-believed Han Sen had turned on them!\n\nAfter the healing, Han Sen went to take a look at the Three-Life Tree alongside the silver fox.\n\nThe silver fox showed interest in the hand, but nothing else.\n\nUnfortunately, the silver fox could not speak. As a result, Han Sen was still clueless about the treasure the tree was giving birth to.\n\n\u201cIf Saint Fan wants it, it must be good! Can it hurry up and grow a little faster?\u201d Han Sen gave the tree another waterdrop while pondering the circumstances.\n\nSaint Fan had been delivered a serious blow, so it wasn\u2019t likely he\u2019d show his face anytime soon. Thinking this, Han Sen decided to return to the Alliance for a time.\n\nHan Sen read a bunch of books and went to the virtual community to practice with others.\n\n\u201cCoach, you fancy a fight?\u201d Immediately after Han Sen entered, Ms. Perfume sent him a message.\n\nComplying, Han Sen sent her an invite. She was, after all, Qin Xuan behind the online handle. She frequently matched with him, and despite losing every single time, she was always improving.\n\nQin Xuan was still practicing Empirical Sword, and it was a one-of-a-kind technique. Its focus went beyond merely dishing out power. There had been a beauty in its crafting, and its existence was like poetry.\n\nHan Sen could simulate the energy flow, but if he did not have the heart for it, he couldn\u2019t perform it.\n\nQin Taixuan had not told her it was actually Han Sen behind the online username \u201cA Soldier on the Warship,\u201d and so, Qin Xuan was still happy to just call him \u201cCoach.\u201d\n\nIn a classic arena, Qin Xuan kept slashing towards Han Sen at full steam without reprieve.\n\nHan Sen did not evade her attacks, and instead, he just used his sword to block.\n\nQin Xuan\u2019s great-grandfather\u2019s username was \u201cA King with Seventy-Two Wives.\u201d If Qin Xuan could not complete the practice required of Empirical Sword and beat Han Sen, then Qin Xuan would not be able to control the skill.\n\nSo Han Sen did not hold back. As a result, Qin Xuan lost every single time.\n\nBut Han Sen was as surprised as he ever was with her determination. Failure never stopped Qin Xuan, and she would always bounce back with vigor and spunk.\n\nPerhaps it was because of Empirical Sword, because the skill required a strong heart and firm courage to master.\n\nHer great-grandfather told Han Sen that Empirical Sword was something to display one\u2019s power and might, but without a strong heart, the sword could break. You had to strike and forego any element of defense. Han Sen was supposed to be her whetstone, for her to use and be kept sharp with.\n\nThe strength of the heart was reflected upon the sword.\n\n\u201cCoach, are you a demi-god?\u201d Qin Xuan asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m only a surpasser,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nQin Xuan was surprised to learn this, provided it was the truth. She said, \u201cPeople as talented as you are surpassers? How difficult must it be to become a demi-god?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfection is not always required,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nShe was even more surprised now, and she said, \u201cAre you going to max out your super geno points before ascending?\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded.\n\nQin Xuan was extra excited to hear this, and she giddily said, \u201cWhich shelter are you at? I have almost maxed out my super geno points, so perhaps we will be able to meet up when I get to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Third God\u2019s Sanctuary is a big place. When you get there, focus on what it will take for you to survive. Don\u2019t concern yourself with me or anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows, though? I might actually end up with you. I\u2019m quite a fortunate person.\u201d Qin Xuan laughed.\n\nHan Sen shook his head and did not respond. He knew Qin Xuan was actually more mature than him, so he wasn\u2019t too worried about how well she\u2019d fare when she made the jump.\n\nBut Han Sen did not think Qin Xuan would be lucky enough to spawn on his shelter, as the chances of that were far too low for consideration."
