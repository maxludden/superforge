    "text": "Every punch Han Sen delivered to the Feather was extremely hard, making the being bleed profusely.\n\nThe Feather\u2019s speed and strength were no worse than Han Sen\u2019s, but its experience and skill were considerably lacking.\n\nOnly their stats were on the same page.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen threw a punch that the Feather managed to dodge. And right after, the Feather retaliated with one aimed for Han Sen\u2019s stomach. This gave Han Sen a shock.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because the Feather\u2019s punch was powerful, though; it was because it was a punch he himself had used once before.\n\n\u201cDeal with him soon! He\u2019s too strong. He learns fast, and you will lose the advantage you currently hold very soon!\u201d Old Cat shouted.\n\nAs Old Cat yelled, Han Sen dodged the punch and grabbed the Feather\u2019s arm. He swiftly jerked his elbow to drive it into his opponent\u2019s throat.\n\nThe Feather shrieked in agony. Han Sen didn\u2019t relent, though, and he twisted his foe\u2019s arm and pinned it against his back. With one hand to keep his arm restricted, Han Sen used his other hand to repeatedly punch his foe in the head.\n\nThe Feather couldn\u2019t muster much strength due to the way its arm was twisted and locked. Without being able to block the attacks, all it could do was submit to the beating and bleed.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe Feather then flipped its body, no longer caring for its arm. The arm broke, but the Feather got free. He stared Han Sen down.\n\nIt was strange, though. The Feather looked as if nothing had happened, and with its head, it tried to ram Han Sen roughly.\n\nHan Sen twirled in an evasion and dodged the strike. He grabbed his enemy by the throat and put him into a chokehold. With his knee, he repeatedly hit the Feather\u2019s chest.\n\nPang!\n\nThe knee pounded the chest like a drum. Han Sen did that five times, until he heard the bones break and could feel the chest cave inwards.\n\nThe Feather coughed up blood and roared. It grabbed Han Sen by the leg and bit it The teeth pierced through his armor and went into his flesh. Han Sen\u2019s reaction was fast, though. He squeezed his foe by the neck and he stopped. If he kept on going, the neck would snap.\n\nHan Sen twisted the Feather\u2019s neck so far around, the head was back-to-front.\n\nThe being smiled at Han Sen as blood poured out of its mouth. It looked scary. A second later, he grabbed Han Sen\u2019s arm and delivered his own twist. He wanted to use the same armlock that Han Sen had.\n\n\u201cYou are too naive to copy my own skills and use them against me.\u201d Han Sen slammed his elbow into the enemy\u2019s face. Blood splattered everywhere as the face caved in. The Feather hit the ground with an impact that formed a crater.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was like a meteor, then. He slammed his knee down against the Feather\u2019s throat, breaking the neck completely.\n\nThe Feather\u2019s head turned to the side, but it had lost all support for turning back. Still, the being didn\u2019t die, and it did its best to stop Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen kept on attacking the Feather until its body was nothing but a mangled mess. When Han Sen took a second to admire his handiwork, he was looking at a mangled mess rather than a body. But he realized that the being still wasn\u2019t dead. It was incredibly sturdy.\n\n\u201cF*ck! Why won\u2019t this thing die?\u201d Han Sen shouted.\n\nOld Cat, who wasn\u2019t too far away, said, \u201cFeathers don\u2019t have a weakness per se. You\u2019ll just have to rip its body apart. There\u2019s nothing else you can really do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s how it\u2019s done, then I will send it to hell in pieces.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s fists raged with greater fury.\n\nThe Feather\u2019s limbs and chest were all broken, and its skull was deformed. But still, the Feather did not die. It was very strong.\n\nPssst!\n\nHan Sen ripped off a bloodied white wing. The Feather let out an animalistic shriek of pain.\n\nHan Sen saw the being reel in pain after that, and he realized that the Feather hadn\u2019t reacted that way to any other injury.\n\nSo, Han Sen grabbed the other wing, too.\n\nHan Sen punched and punched until the bones broke and he could rip the wings off.\n\nThe Feather grabbed Han Sen, but Han Sen kicked him off. Then, he went back to pummeling the thing like crazy.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu!\u201d When he punched, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but copy Xie Qing King. It felt as if he\u2019d punch harder that way.\n\nPang!\n\nThe power was brought down on the Feather\u2019s neck, and after hundreds of punches, the neck finally began to give. After that, Han Sen ripped the enemy\u2019s head off.\n\nBut strangely, the body without a brain still wanted a piece of Han Sen. And the head itself tried to bite into Han Sen\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cF*ck you!\u201d Han Sen kicked the body away and rammed his fist into the brain. He mashed it continuously.\n\nBlood and juices went everywhere as the head broke.\n\nWith the repeated punches, the head exploded. Juice went everywhere.\n\nThe Feather\u2019s headless body approached. With burning eyes, Han Sen moved to punch it.\n\nWith a multitude of punches, Han Sen was able to break its body. The organs turned into pulp and it eventually stopped moving.\n\nHan Sen wiped the blood off his face and slumped down on the ground, gasping. He felt as if his limbs were numb.\n\nThat was the first time Han Sen had beaten something for so long that he exhausted himself in the process.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what was this thing?\u201d Han Sen looked at Old Cat. The cat went over to the corpse and tried to take something off it\n\nEven though Han Sen was tired, he still jumped up and went in front of Old Cat. He licked his lips and said, \u201cOld Cat, this is wrong. You didn\u2019t do anything and now you want to loot whatever is available?\u201d\n\nOld Cat smiled and said, \u201cI am worried that you didn\u2019t realize it was a good item. I was just going to fetch it for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? What did you see?\u201d Han Sen asked him.\n\n\u201cI see these bones aren\u2019t too bad. They might make a good soup.\u201d Old Cat gave him a thumbs up.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t believe this. He stepped over to the body and examined it more closely.\n\n\u201cOld Cat was digging right about here, so what was he after?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. He only saw organs, blood, and bones. It was pretty gross to look at.\n\nIt was fortunate Han Sen was not super hygienic. He rooted around in the organs and bones and searched amongst the blood for a bit. He eventually found something, and it sure didn\u2019t feel like bone."
