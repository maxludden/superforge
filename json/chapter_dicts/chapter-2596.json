    "text": "Han Sen was a part of the Rebate now. But he was a very prestigious individual in Sky Palace, and he could come and go as he pleased. He was treated like one of the people of Sky Palace, as if he shared a direct lineage with them.\n\nHan Sen even had an island for himself in Sky Palace. It was the little jade island he used to occupy.\n\nLittle Silver and Little Star were registered to occupy the little jade island as well. Han Sen wanted to use his Blood-Pulse Sutra power on them to make their blood stronger. But his body had yet to recover, and so, he could no longer do it.\n\nLittle Silver tried to heal Han Sen\u2019s damaged body using his healing powers, in all of their electrifying glory. His attempt did have a positive effect, but it was fairly minuscule.\n\nHan Sen gave the Thunder God Spike to Little Silver. Little Silver and the Thunder God Spike\u2019s power could benefit each other, so it would be good for his evolution.\n\nHe used Glasses to examine all the creatures around him. They all had a five-star potential. And in regards to their real potential, he would find that out once they became deified.\n\nOne day, Han Sen was on his island sunbathing. Bao\u2019er was sitting nearby, still nibbling her purple ginseng. It wasn\u2019t getting any smaller, despite her constant gnawing. Little Angel and Zero were preparing lunch. Han Meng\u2019er was holding the Six Core Snake Bow, and she was practicing archery.\n\nLittle Silver and Little Star were lying on the ground quietly. There was a little beast that was like a white snowball scurrying around. Snowball was a creature from the sanctuaries. It was very special, as it could shield itself inside a white orb that couldn\u2019t be broken.\n\nHan Sen had brought the little creature to the geno universe back when he was on Planet Eclipse. Snowball had a good relationship with Xie Qing King, and it had spent most of its time in the universe following him about.\n\nWhen Narrow Moon was first brought to Sky Palace, Snowball wasn\u2019t there. It had been with Xie Qing King.\n\nHan Sen was wondering why Xie Qing King had sent Snowball to him instead of just calling him on the phone. When Han Sen saw the item Snowball had come to deliver, he realized with shock that Xie Qing King\u2019s Overbearing President Love Luv Looove had been made into a movie that was going to be on air soon.\n\nSnowball\u2019s delivery of a ticket of admission was a roundabout way of showing off.\n\nHan Sen searched the internet of the universe and found that Xie Qing King\u2019s Overbearing President Love Luv Looove was insanely popular. His title was Teacher Xie.\n\nHan Sen tried to find out how many copies of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove had been sold so far, and there were many zeroes. There were at least a billion, Han Sen thought. \u201cGood grief! How much did Xie Qing King earn?\u201d Han Sen was frozen. No matter how much Han Sen fought or all the deified weapons he earned, he hadn\u2019t made as much money as Xie Qing King and his drawings.\n\n\u201cShould I start drawing something, too?\u201d Han Sen was interested in the concept, but he realized that his drawing abilities were more than lacking. So, he shelved the idea.\n\nSky Palace was going to be screening the movie, too. Han Sen brought Han Meng\u2019er with him to watch it. It was just going to be them, so they could have the entire theater exclusively for themselves.\n\nWhen they went to the theater, Han Sen encountered Yun Suyi, Yun Sushang, and Thousand Feather Crane. They were all King class now. They had progressed just as quickly as Han Sen.\n\nIn fact, Han Sen\u2019s progress hadn\u2019t been all that fast. He was slowed by his need to fulfill the requirements of four separate geno arts. If he only practiced one, and it wasn\u2019t The Story of Genes, he would have likely been deified by now.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, are you alright?\u201d Yun Suyi asked, looking at Han Sen.\n\nThey had wanted to visit the little jade island to see Han Sen a while ago, but Sky Palace forbade ordinary people from visiting there. So, this was the first time they had seen Han Sen in a long time.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t look so good. His body was all dry like a piece of smoked meat. It took Thousand Feather Crane a minute to recognize him.\n\n\u201cMuch better. I\u2019m almost okay. I was going to visit you guys a few days ago, but Elder Yun wouldn\u2019t let me leave the little jade island until now,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\n\u201cWe know. We were told the same thing, or we would have already visited you on the little jade island,\u201d Thousand Feather Crane said.\n\n\u201cThe movie is going to start. Let\u2019s go in!\u201d Yun Sushang said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen bought the whole theater. There was a lot of space, so he invited them there to watch it all together.\n\nDue to Han Sen already knowing what happened in the story, he wasn\u2019t too caught up in the movie. He was surprised to see Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang like it as much as they did. They were very excited. They would laugh at times, and at other times weep and cry their eyes out.\n\nIn the end, the main character rescued a female character. When they kissed, Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were so touched, their eyes almost turned into the shape of little hearts.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how strong a woman might be; they all have the same heart.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\n\nAfter the movie finished, Han Sen invited the three of them to have dinner. They talked comfortably together as they headed back.\n\n\u201cHow come I never hear about Lone Bamboo anymore?\u201d Han Sen asked Thousand Feather Crane. He had asked other people about Lone Bamboo, but they were all so dodgy about the subject that he never really received an answer.\n\nThousand Feather Crane hesitated, but Yun Suyi said angrily, \u201cIt is because of that Exquisite!\u201d\n\n\u201cExquisite?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He knew the name, but he didn\u2019t think Exquisite would have anything to do with Lone Bamboo.\n\n\u201cSuyi, stop talking.\u201d Thousand Feather Crane frowned.\n\n\u201cIs this something I\u2019m not allowed to know about?\u201d Han Sen asked, glancing at Thousand Feather Crane.\n\nThousand Feather Crane shook his head and said, \u201cNot exactly, but this incident cannot be helped. Even if you know, there is nothing you can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t taboo, then why don\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nThousand Feather Crane still hesitated. Yun Suyi had practically told Han Sen the whole story, anyway.There was a good connection between Sky Palace and the Very High. People often believed Sky Palace was the mouthpiece for the Very High. Although Sky Palace wasn\u2019t one of the three highest races, the Extreme King were quite scared of Sky Palace, as well.\n\nIn fact, Sky Palace depended on the power of the Very High. So, Exquisite and the other Very High came to Sky Palace. They asked Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin to join the Very High, and it was a request that Sky Palace couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\nYu Shanxin agreed, whereas Lone Bamboo refused Exquisite\u2019s offer.\n\nThis created some tension and a widening rift between Sky Palace and the Very High. The Very High didn\u2019t relent in their request, though. And Lone Bamboo didn\u2019t waver or give in to their demands. So, the leader of Sky Palace locked Lone Bamboo up.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t Lone Bamboo refuse to join the Very High?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nThousand Feather Crane shook his head with a wry smile. \u201cThe relationship between Sky Palace and the Very High is very complicated. It seems as if there was some sort of agreement in place. Our leader is in hot water right now. He cannot refuse the demands of the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Lone Bamboo is locked up, does that mean that they\u2019ve dropped their demand?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nThousand Feather Crane chuckled and said, \u201cWere it so easy. The Very High haven\u2019t said anything. They haven\u2019t yet said whether or not Lone Bamboo has to go. If they haven\u2019t canceled their request, we have to respond somehow. We cannot sweep this matter under the rug.\u201d"
