    "text": "Fear gripped Han Sen\u2019s throat, but he found himself falling back before Old Cat even made the suggestion. He summoned his Death Armor Swordsman beast soul and transformed into the Death Armor Swordsman.\n\nHan Sen had no choice but to use the beast soul as his fitness was low. And since he was wearing the glove, he could not summon the white armor. He could only summon beast souls.\n\nThe angd-looking creature blurred toward him, while Han Sen was also fast, he wasn\u2019t fast enough to dodge.\n\nHan Sen gritted his teeth and used his hand to protect his chest for a block.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had been hit by a train. His body was sent flying, and he went barreling into one of the walls of the laboratory. He broke through the wall and continued flying back.\n\nAfter bursting through a few walls, Han Sen came to a stop. He fell to the ground and spat out some blood.\n\nHan Sen did not have time to wipe his lips, though, and he immediately regained his feet and started running. Old Cat was running, too, and he went right past Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen turned around and saw the red-eyed angel giving chase at a blisteringly swift speed.\n\n\u201cSh*t! What is that thing?\u201d Han Sen ran as fast as he could, but the being was way too strong. Not even geno armor could bestow the strength necessary to beat it.\n\nOld Cat ran, and as he went, he screamed, \u201cAfter the crystallizers lost the war, they stole a few children from the higher race. I thought it was only a myth. But look at this! It\u2019s f*cking real! Crystallizers brought Feathers to such places for research, as they wanted their genes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA superior race? What superior race?\u201d Han Sen gnashed his teeth.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask. Just run! It\u2019s going to catch up!\u201d Old Cat shouted.\n\nHan Sen turned around, and the Feather was right behind him. The fist was coming so quickly, strong and fast\n\nHan Sen had already taken a hit, and his chest was still in pain. This time, he\u2019d definitely be unable to dodge. He gritted his teeth and summoned Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nPang!\n\nThe feather punched Destiny\u2019s Tower, and the bottom of Destiny\u2019s Tower actually caved in.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Tower had gone through the God\u2019s Door test It was far stronger than it had been before, like geno armor. But even so, the Feather had just punched it. The power required to do what the Feather had just done was breath-taking.\n\nHan Sen had intended to use Destiny\u2019s Tower to absorb the Feather, but the Feather\u2019s punch was enough to knock Destiny\u2019s Tower away. The bottom of it caved-in.\n\nHan Sen gasped and kept on running. The Feather was way too over-powered, and it made for a terrifying foe.\n\nThe Feather kept chasing, while Han Sen used Destiny\u2019s Tower as much as he could to block it The Feather\u2019s punches had made Destiny\u2019s Tower all crooked and twisted. It\u2019d break if things continued like this.\n\nBut Han Sen could not really spare concern over Destiny\u2019s Tower, given the circumstances. He had no choice but to use it to keep himself alive.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what is this? Can you deal with it?\u201d Han Sen shouted at Old Cat. Even if he sacrificed Destiny\u2019s Tower, an escape did not seem likely. When the tower broke, he would be killed.\n\n\u201cStop thinking and just run! It\u2019s beyond either of our levels. This thing must have been tortured by the crystallizers. It\u2019s probably weak in comparison to others. If this thing was operating at full strength, you\u2019d already be dead!\u201d Old Cat shouted.\n\nHan Sen wanted to run, but he felt as if he no longer could. Hearing Old Cat say that their foe was that strong, he knew this was the direst of circumstances.\n\n\u201cThis guy cannot be a creature from outside!\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Old Cat said without hesitation.\n\nHan Sen was feeling desperate, as there was no safe place he could run to. The Feather punched Destiny\u2019s Tower with an extra hardy hit, and it sent the tower flying away. The Feather was the same as it had been, though. And then, it threw another punch towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen used so many different types of movement, but he was incapable of evading the Feather. He gritted his teeth and threw a punch back at the foe.\n\nHan Sen was prepared to borrow strength from every ability he had. The fitness of a super creature was minuscule in comparison to a Feather, after all. He used Yin Yang Blast\u2019s yin power. Even if he was risking having his organs damaged, he had to try to outrun his pursuer.\n\nThe fists collided with each other. And as the fists came into contact, Han Sen readied himself. He felt a scary power come through his right fist, hitting the Feather.\n\nThose two powers created a massive shockwave that toppled all the buildings around them, while Han Sen was entirely fine.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s right hand was glowing. The light shone across his body, and he was completely wrapped up by it. Han Sen felt as if he was full of power. It was almost endless, like an endless river coursing through his body.\n\nThe armor that looked like jade and bone started to cover up his entire body. It almost looked like he was wearing the white geno armor, but he wasn\u2019t. Before Han Sen could get a better look, though, the Feather appeared again. Its fist was raging toward him, and the speed was incredibly fast\n\nHan Sen quickly dodged the Feather, and he was surprised. With the armor that had come from the glove, he could catch up with the Feather\u2019s speed.\n\nFeather threw a punch, but Han Sen was unafraid. He walked forward to it, dodged the fist, and struck the Feather\u2019s belly. This resulted in the Feather looking like a shrimp, shooting backward.\n\nHan Sen was happy about this, but his hand was not relenting. It was going after the Feather. His fists and legs followed like a storm.\n\nWith the armor\u2019s buffing, Han Sen\u2019s strength and speed were now comparable to the Feather. The Feather only had strength, though. It had no skill or technique. This allowed Han Sen to suppress it with ease.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Old Cat saw the changes surge through Han Sen\u2019s glove, and he looked shocked. And then he looked annoyed, and said, \u201cThat glove is actually good! I would have gone and gotten it myself, if I had known.\u201d"
