    "text": "Bai Wei frowned and gathered up an invisible power in her fist. She was going to cast her Extreme King Punch. But all of a sudden, she felt something tighten around her waist. A strong arm grabbed her and yanked her backward.\n\nHan Sen stood in front of Bai Wei. His eyes were so clear, and his Ghost Teeth Knife was brimming with a dark purple knife air. It rose to meet Bai Wuchang\u2019s knife.\n\nBai Wei was now behind Han Sen, and she shouted over his shoulder, \u201cBe careful! His Phantom Ghost King Body can attack both your physical self and the very essence of your soul. Don\u2019t let him get close to you!\u201d\n\nAfter Bai Wei said that, Bai Wuchang\u2019s knife came down on Han Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife. Bai Wuchang\u2019s knife didn\u2019t even seem to have a corporeal form. It pierced through Han Sen\u2019s blade, carrying Bai Wuchang\u2019s body through the Ghost Teeth Knife and the Teeth power. He came slashing towards Han Sen like a real ghost.\n\nThe cold, cold flame was about to touch Han Sen\u2019s hand. Han Sen squinted his eyes and moved his feet. Still holding Bai Wei by the waist, he teleported away.\n\nBai Wuchang was fast, though, and his attacks never paused. He slashed behind Han Sen like a bug on his skin.\n\nHan Sen did not dodge. He took a swing at Bai Wuchang\u2019s knife.\n\nBai Wei was confused. After seeing the man\u2019s previous strikes, Han Sen should have known that Bai Wuchang\u2019s Phantom Ghost King Body couldn\u2019t be challenged by ordinary weapons. His knife wouldn\u2019t be able to block Bai Wuchang\u2019s strikes.\n\nDong!\n\nTwo knives came against each other with a metallic shriek. Bai Wei\u2019s eyes widened, overwhelmed by utter disbelief. Bai Wuchang\u2019s Phantom Ghost King Body bad been blocked.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible\u2026\u201d Shock reverberated through Bai Wei. Han Sen\u2019s first attempt to block Bai Wuchang\u2019s Phantom Ghost King Body had utterly failed, but this time it seemed to be working.\n\nBai Wuchang was surprised, as well. But ultimately, he looked even more excited. His knife slashed toward Han Sen like some ghost from the phantom world.\n\nHan Sen put down Bai Wei and used his knife skills to fight back against Bai Wuchang. He moved around continually, and he blocked each of Bai Wuchang\u2019s strikes.\n\nThe fierce fighting soon drew the attention of all the nearby royal children. They could sense the ghostly echoes of Bai Wuchang\u2019s strange power.\n\nPhantom Ghost King Body\u2019s signature style was well-known, and people could feel its presence from great distances away.\n\n\u201cBai Wuchang has gone mad again. Who is the unlucky one this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Phantom Ghost King Body is too scary. There aren\u2019t many substances that are able to harm Bai Wuchang. Even many King class opponents can do nothing to stop him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Otherwise, why would the King love him so much?\u201d\n\nMany people stood in close proximity to the fight. They wanted to see who had been unlucky enough to draw Bai Wuchang\u2019s attention.\n\nBai Canglang sensed the activation of the Phantom Ghost King Body and frowned. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s coming from behind us\u2026 Does that mean that Bai Wei is the one battling Bai Wuchang?\u201d\n\nA while later, Bai Canglang rallied his guards to follow him back.\n\n\u201cHuh, who is this guy Bai Wuchang is fighting? His knife is able to block the Phantom Ghost King Body.\u201d A few of the royal children had drawn near, and they were shocked to witness the fight unfolding between Han Sen and Bai Wuchang.\n\nSome powers were known to be able to counter the Phantom Ghost King Body, but only a few. It was quite remarkable that a Duke they had never seen before could block the Phantom Ghost King Body. He didn\u2019t appear to be at a disadvantage against Bai Wuchang, either. The sight was quite unusual.\n\nWhen Bai Canglang saw the fight, he was also stunned. He frowned and said, \u201cThe Rebate\u2019s Teeth Knife does wield a good deal of destructive power, but it shouldn\u2019t work very well on the Phantom Ghost King Body. How is Han Sen managing to block the Phantom Ghost King Body? Does his knife possess some special element?\u201d\n\nThe other royal children were thinking similar thoughts. Only Bai Wei and Bai Wuchang knew Han Sen\u2019s knife wasn\u2019t actually able to block the Phantom Ghost King Body.\n\nThe others that had come were unable to discern the difference. Han Sen wasn\u2019t using pure Teeth power; instead, he had mixed in another technique. He was fueling Teeth Knife with power from The Story of Genes, which could last forever.\n\nTeeth power was unable to touch Bai Wuchang by itself, but the Eternally Solidified power in combination with Teeth Knife was able to strike the Phantom Ghost King Body.\n\n\u201cWho is this Duke?\u201d Many of the royal children looked on with gaping mouths. Not only could Han Sen touch the Phantom Ghost King Body, but his power and knife skills were proving to be just as good as Bai Wuchang\u2019s. His techniques and movement patterns were weird, and Bai Wuchang seemed to be having difficulty fighting him.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s movements were very light. The Ghost Teeth Knife looked as if it was casually dancing, but every skill was very accurate and focused. It made Bai Wuchang feel as if he couldn\u2019t make use of much power.\n\n\u201cHis knife skills look like the skills of the Rebate, but the way he moves seems different. It looks like something you\u2019d see in Sky Palace.\u201d\n\nThe Extreme King had many elites, so they had an easier time identifying some of Han Sen\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife was combined with the Under the Sky knife skill. Because Under the Sky had just been discovered, not many people in Sky Palace had learned it yet. And so, not many people had seen it before. But with that being said, people were able to guess that it was indeed a skill born in Sky Palace.\n\n\u201cGreat. Where does this Duke come from? His knife skills are excellent. If we are just talking about his abilities with a knife, I would say he is definitely stronger than Bai Wuchang.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did such a powerful Duke like this come from? I wonder which royal child\u2019s guard he is?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen suddenly fell back and slashed Ghost Teeth Knife forward. Dark purple knife silks floated down from space, wispy and half-transparent. They meshed together and began to bind Bai Wuchang.\n\nBai Wuchang\u2019s body was snared by the cloud of knife silks. He couldn\u2019t move, and he was tied up in the air.\n\nBai Wuchang roared to the sky like a beast, and his cold flame blazed higher. He cut the knife silks off his body, then madly rushed towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen moved. His Ghost Teeth Knife seemed to slash in a meandering, casual way. The knife silks kept appearing around Bai Wuchang, though, and it was like many spider webs were falling across him. They restricted his body, limiting his ability to fight back.\n\nAlthough Bai Wuchang kept forcing his power to surge in order to break the knife silks wrapped around him, he couldn\u2019t make his way to Han Sen.\n\nHe burst through the nets many times, but he was starting to have difficulty summoning enough strength. And while he was taking damage, he was losing more and more of his power reserves.\n\nNot long after, Bai Wuchang\u2019s cold flame became unstable. It flickered wildly, making the semi-transparent body look solid.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Ghost Teeth Knife was thrust forward. Bai Wuchang\u2019s body was tightly bound, and this time, no matter how hard he tried, Bai Wuchang didn\u2019t have the power to free himself. He could no longer break the knife silks that had locked him in place. The knife silks had reoriented themselves to hang him upside down. He could not free himself. All of the royal children seemed to be frozen."
