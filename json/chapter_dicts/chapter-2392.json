Instead, he let himself be pulled through.\n\nThis was a necessary part of the process of becoming a King. Whenever a King class creature successfully kickstarted their self-universe cogwheel, they were given permission to enter the geno universe core area.\n\nNo one had ever been able to determine the exact nature of the core area. Some said that it was actually a special xenogeneic gene. Others claimed that it was a location within the geno hall. There were many other guesses, but no matter which theory was more popular at the moment, there was never any evidence to support one claim over another.\n\nFor now, there was only one thing that everyone agreed on: the core area could be accessed through the self-universe cogwheel once someone ascended to King class.\n\nWhen your cogwheel began spinning for the first time, you would be pulled into the universal core area. Just like Han Sen was being pulled in now.\n\nHis body flew into the blinding light shining through the door, and when his vision returned, he found himself to be standing inside a palace built of some ancient metal.\n\nThis palace was a strange patchwork structure. The entire place was composed of differently-sized cogwheels. The walls, floors, and roof were all like this. And the wheels were fitted so tightly together that there were no visible seams.\n\nEvery cogwheel was spinning at a different speed. Some moved so quickly that they blurred, whereas others were so slow that their movement was almost imperceptible. Rhythmic tick-tock sounds filled the palace, similar to the sounds that a mechanical watch might produce.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t have time for sightseeing, though, because his body was still hosting the powers of the Sacred Blood Statue and the Nine-Tailed Fox. Leveling up to King class hadn\u2019t proved enough to destroy those energies.\n\nHan Sen suddenly decided to use The Story of Genes. He wanted to see if he could use the Sacred Blood Statue and Nine-Tailed Fox power to push The Story of Genes self-universe cogwheel.\n\nThat was hoping for too much, though. The Sacred Blood Statue and the Nine-Tailed Fox\u2019s power wasn\u2019t enough to push the self-universe cogwheel of The Story of Genes. As Han Sen tried to use them, their powers subsided and eventually vanished. In the end, they disappeared.\n\nHan Sen checked out his own body, just to be sure, but he didn\u2019t find any trace of them within him. Then, he looked back at the palace.\n\nThe cogwheels were in constant motion like the gears of a watch. But unlike a watch, the palace had no needles to tell time. Instead, there were just more teeth. The more teeth a cogwheel had, the slower it spun. The fewer teeth a cogwheel had, the faster it went. Watching the clocks was strangely mesmerizing, almost lulling. It was like being in a palace full of clocks.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was hanging in midair. When his feet touched a cogwheel on the floor, the cogwheel accelerated. The change in speed swept out through the connected cogwheels, and soon the entire palace was humming with greater energy. The dimension of the place was twisted disconcertingly. A few moments later, the door of the palace opened, revealing a starscape beyond.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was currently safely ensconced in his Dongxuan Armor. He walked out of the universal core palace and looked up at the myriad of stars. Upon closer observation, however, he realized that what he had first taken for stars were actually scary King creatures.\n\nWhen Han Sen stepped out of the universal core palace, the whirring sound of the palace\u2019s cogwheels disappeared.\n\nHan Sen knew he could summon the universal core palace whenever he wanted by pushing his self-universe cogwheel.\n\nBut this was the first time Han Sen had entered the universal core area, and he didn\u2019t want to leave yet. He wanted to look around for himself and see if this place was just as the legends described it.\n\nSuddenly, a light shot past Han Sen, vanishing behind him. Then it reappeared a while later, swinging around so it could head straight for him.\n\nHan Sen was suddenly worried. Entering the universal core area required at least King class power, but deified elites could access this place as well. Han Sen was just a first-tier King, so he knew that he needed to be careful.\n\nThe star came to a stop in front of Han Sen. Now that Han Sen could get a better look at it, he realized that it was Dragon Eight of the Dragon. He was King class, as well.\n\n\u201cDollar.\u201d Dragon Eight looked at Han Sen with fiery eyes.\n\nWhen Han Sen joined the battles of the geno scroll, he fought as Dollar. There, he wore his Dongxuan Armor. Therefore, Han Sen rarely wore it when he wasn\u2019t using his Dollar identity. He didn\u2019t want to expose the fact that he and Dollar were the same person.\n\nAfter the Dongxuan Sutra evolved twice, the Dongxuan Armor\u2019s appearance had changed radically. Now, the Dongxuan Armor was solid black, so dark that it lacked any semblance of light. Any light that landed on it would disappear instantly. It someone looked at Han Sen from afar, he would seem like a black shadow hanging in the air.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t expected someone to recognize him as Dollar just because of the Dongxuan Armor.\n\nSince he was recognized, though, Han Sen made no effort to deny the claim. He looked at Dragon Eight and said, \u201cDragon Eight?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember me? Good.\u201d The fire of insanity in Dragon Eight\u2019s eyes blazed even higher. He had lost to Dollar in one of the geno scroll battles. He hadn\u2019t gotten over his loss, and he had been researching better ways to fight Dollar ever since.\n\nBut he had been unable to find Dollar. He didn\u2019t expect to find him there, of all places. He opened his gold area and doused Han Sen in the light. With an arrogant smirk, he said, \u201cThis time, I am going to beat you. Release your area.\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon Eight, what are you doing?\u201d As Han Sen answered, a few more lights arrived. They were Kings of the Dragon. Han Sen even identified one of them as Dragon One.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Dragon One must have been half-deified by now, and he wasn\u2019t the only powerful Dragon who had come. If they all attacked Han Sen together, things would definitely go badly for him.\n\n\u201cBig Dragon, he is Dollar!\u201d Dragon Eight snarled, still staring at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDollar?\u201d asked Dragon One and the others in surprise. Dollar\u2019s performance in the geno scroll had been truly remarkable, even to them.\n\nBut Dollar hadn\u2019t become an obsession for them the way he had for Dragon Eight. And they hadn\u2019t been able to recognize him, initially. After a while, though, they started to believe the claim.\n\n\u201cYou really are Dollar?\u201d Dragon One asked Han Sen uncertainly.\n\n\u201cSo, what? Does it matter if I am or not?\u201d Han Sen responded smoothly.\n\n\u201cI know that I\u2019m right. He is Dollar! The rest of you need to stay back, because he is mine!\u201d Dragon Eight bared his teeth in a rictus grin. \u201cDollar, open your area. Let me see if you are as strong as you were before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is unnecessary,\u201d Han Sen said, gathering power in his finger as he spoke. He sent a coin flying toward Dragon Eight.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever underestimate me!\u201d Dragon Eight shouted, and his gold area became solid. It transformed into an old golden chest, trapping the coin inside it.\n\nDong!\n\nThe golden chest fell under the power of the coin, but it didn\u2019t draw closer to Dragon Eight.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful metal area!\u201d Han Sen complimented his opponent.\n\nDragon Eight\u2019s area allowed him to generate metal and make things solid. If Dragon Eight wanted to, he could seal Han Sen within the golden area.\n\nIt was similar to Nine-Headed Bird\u2019s coffin suppression, but Dragon Eight\u2019s area wasn\u2019t just for sealing foes."
