He knew she\u2019d get to witness its power sooner or later, anyway.\n\nDisloyal Knight approached the entrance of the shelter, and already, purple mantises began to emerge in a bid to assault the would-be trespassers. Some of them came from beyond the gate, whereas others leaped down from the perimeter wall of the shelter. They had wings to glide, but they could not use them to properly fly.\n\nHan Sen had encountered mantises before, and he knew their arms were practically blades.\n\nOne of the mantises was as big as a tiger, clearly above the others that had come to attack. It jumped before Disloyal Knight.\n\n\u201cThat might be the sacred-blood mantis,\u201d Queen said.\n\nThe mantis that jumped in front of Disloyal Knight swiftly raised its arm-blade to swipe at his neck and sever the head from his metal shoulders.\n\nPang!\n\nDisloyal Knight punched the mantis with a fist that was as quick as lightning. The creature was sent flying into a nearby wall, as a fist-shaped hole was left in its now-bleeding carapace.\n\nDisloyal Knight fired up the halo and then got to work, slaying an abundance of mantises with a single punch to each.\n\nHan Sen heard announcements continuously ring inside his head.\n\nQueen watched as Disloyal Knight brutalized the inhabitants of the shelter. It only took two small punches for a sacred-blood creature to fall.\n\n\u201cSacred-Blood Creature Devil-Blood Mantis killed. Beast soul gained. Consume its flesh to gain zero to ten sacred geno points randomly.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was delighted at the result. He had managed to obtain a beast soul from his first sacred-blood kill.\n\nSeeing the Disloyal Knight lay waste to all the creatures outside the shelter, it then proceeded to enter. To this, Han Sen said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s clear the rest out. We can collect the flesh later.\u201d\n\nQueen had been in shock when Han Sen provided her all those beast souls when they first met up again. But now, she had been delivered another shock. His Disloyal Knight could kill sacred-blood creatures with ease.\n\n\u201cDisloyal Knight\u2026 it cannot be\u2026 is it?\u201d She shook her head to rid herself of the thought. If what she thought it might be was true, it\u2019d be frightening to consider.\n\n\u201cAll those people who believe Han Sen has now been rendered harmless\u2026 What would they say if they saw him now?\u201d Queen thought to herself.\n\nHan Sen had been in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary for less than a year before he suffered his injury. It was crazy to try to comprehend what he had managed to achieve in such a short period of time.\n\nQueen was a surpasser with a super body, yet even she knew how difficult things were with a super body. It didn\u2019t give anyone that much of a leg up.\n\nIf Han Sen hadn\u2019t given her the beast souls, it would have taken her an extremely long time to work up the strength necessary to kill a mutant creature.\n\nWith no resources or help, Han Sen had reached this level in less than a year. It was a remarkable accomplishment, something no one had ever managed before.\n\n\u201cPeople think they can be like Han Sen if they have a super body? Pah, that notion is ridiculous,\u201d Queen thought as she stared at Han Sen in admiration.\n\nAfter Han Sen ventured inside for a short while, bodies were soon strewn about in bloody piles.\n\nWithout a single break, Han Sen kept hearing the announcements play. He killed four primitive, one mutant, and one sacred-blood mantis on the inside of the shelter.\n\nHan Sen checked out the beast soul he had received and noticed it was a set of armor. He then gave it to Queen, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. It will be a long road, and one that will be more safely traversed while wearing this.\u201d\n\nQueen could not even respond. She just accepted it and wore it.\n\nIt was a purple set of armor, and with its shiny sheen, she looked even more attractive than before. The rounded chest plate made her boobs look even bigger.\n\nIt was tight around her waist, and it helped to accentuate her each and every curve. Her beauty was head and shoulders above any other woman Han Sen had seen, and she was pure, riveting eye candy.\n\nThe armor itself was a remarkable piece of gear, too. The gauntlets were fitted with blades like teeth, a feature that was not often seen on armor.\n\nThe legs and knees were fitted with blades, too. It was a great repellant for anything that sought to get too close.\n\n\u201cThat is a perfect set of armor,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nQueen moved around to get a feel for it. It was comfortable and did not stifle her agility, but she thought she looked like a monster.\n\nAs Han Sen admired the stunning femme fatale, his gaze was cut-short by the sudden sound of a wretched shriek. It came from just outside the shelter.\n\nDisloyal Knight punched a mantis that was as big as an elephant. The power that had been delivered against it was so high, it vibrated the earth and rattled the rocks that littered the ground.\n\n\u201cIs that a super creature?\u201d Han Sen had hoped to encounter one, but he hadn\u2019t really expected to see one there.\n\nDisloyal Knight continued to rapidly punch the mantis\u2019s arm. More and more shockwaves were generated, and the decayed shelter started to fall apart.\n\n\u201cSuper creature?!\u201d Queen looked at the Disloyal Knight in utter shock. She reckoned it had to be one, and this had confirmed it."
