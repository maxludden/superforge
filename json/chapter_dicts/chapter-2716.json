    "text": "\u201cTheir powers aren\u2019t sufficient at King class?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\nGru shook his head. \u201cKing class Immortal Dragons have a decent area power, but the ability is only useful for healing some external trauma. For most elites, that isn\u2019t very useful. Taming one of the creatures for that ability alone is hardly worth it. Deified Immortal Dragons are a different story, however. They can keep you alive in all sorts of situations. Many deified elites would like to have a deified Immortal Dragon. Anyone would want something that has the potential to save their lives.\u201d\n\nWhen he heard Gru say this, Han Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He thought to himself, \u201cIt is very lucky that I\u2019ve found this Immortal Dragon to use in my test. If the black crystal really works, maybe I can get a deified Immortal Dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Han, the deified xenogeneic I want to kill is in Full Moon River. It is only 200 miles from here. If you have the time, maybe we can go there?\u201d Gru said hopefully to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI want to get a xenogeneic as a mount. Based on what you\u2019ve told me, the Immortal Dragon doesn\u2019t seem too bad. I think I\u2019ll capture that Immortal Dragon. Once I have the Immortal Dragon, if you still haven\u2019t killed the deified xenogeneic on your own, I can go as well to help you out.\u201d If Gru\u2019s xenogeneic was really that nearby, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t mind going after it.\n\n\u201cSure. I will stay here and wait for you. It is just an Immortal Dragon, so I am sure you will get it easily.\u201d Gru smiled.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t care if the man stayed. It would only be a matter of time before others found out he was catching a xenogeneic. There was no way to hide it, but neither was there a need to.\n\nThe two of them waited where they were for a while. The Immortal Dragon was beating the pulp out of the Moon Rhino; with its immortal area active, the Immortal Dragon was impervious to the rhino\u2019s attacks.\n\nIn the end, Han Sen and Gru watched the Immortal Dragon open its mouth and choke down the badly injured Moon Rhino.\n\nThe rhino\u2019s body was much bigger than the Immortal Dragon\u2019s body. After the Immortal Dragon swallowed its foe, its body expanded like a big balloon. Han Sen wondered if the dragon could actually digest something so large.\n\nBut for Han Sen, this was a very good opportunity. The Immortal Dragon had eaten the entire Moon Rhino, and it was now settling down to digest its meal. It wasn\u2019t paying much attention to its surroundings.\n\nHan Sen flew toward it and fired out an array of silks from his knife. Han Sen lifted his finger, and the knife silks tied up the Immortal Dragon.\n\nImmortal Dragon was terrified. It shivered in fear, but when it tried to run away, the knife silks tightened and cut into the creature\u2019s body. Although its area was obscenely powerful, it wouldn\u2019t help much if the dragon sliced itself into pieces.\n\nOnce it had recovered, the creature tried to struggle free again. It was worried about being cut, though. Eventually, the Immortal Dragon realized that it couldn\u2019t escape the knife silks without killing itself. It stopped moving, carefully trying not to touch the knife silks circling its body.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be fairly intelligent,\u201d Han Sen said with a laugh. And then, he lifted a hand and drew slowly on the knife silks. The Immortal Dragon immediately responded to the tug, slithering forward across the ground to keep the silks from drawing tight again.\n\nBut the Moon Rhino was still in the creature\u2019s belly. The roundness of its stomach made it difficult for the Immortal Dragon to slither forward. It moved way too slow, and the knife silks cut into the beast\u2019s scales. Each cut caused the creature to release a nasty screech.\n\n\u201cYou are good, Brother Han. The power to create these silks and control them with masterful precision\u2026 You aren\u2019t too far off the talent of a genuine deified elite,\u201d Gru complimented him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re laying it on thick.\u201d Han Sen was still suspicious that Gru might be harboring ulterior motives.\n\nEven if Gru wasn\u2019t a part of the Bai family, there were many within the Extreme King that hated Han Sen. Han Sen doubted that Gru was as detached as he seemed.\n\nBut now that he had agreed to go with Gru, he no longer had an excuse to delay their venture. He left the Immortal Dragon trapped in the knife silks. Every hour the fiend spent in captivity would grind at its mind. Han Sen then turned to follow Gru deep up Full Moon River.\n\nHan Sen still suspected that Gru might have a conspiracy up his sleeve, but when they reached their destination, Han Sen was relieved to find that there really was a deified xenogeneic on the riverbank.\n\nThat xenogeneic looked like a wolf. Its hair was grey, but it had four eyes. Its fangs were like hooks. The beast looked extremely evil.\n\nAs they made their way up the river, Gru had told Han Sen that the deified xenogeneic was talented with eye skills. Its eyes released an indestructible godlight. The creature\u2019s attacks were shockingly fast. Gru wouldn\u2019t have lasted long on his own.\n\nThe four-eyed wolf saw Gru, and it howled angrily and got to its feet. Its four eyes opened wide, and a weird green light began to glow inside them. The beast suddenly released four green beams that shot right toward Gru.\n\nClearly, the four-eyed wolf really hated Gru. It was obvious that this wasn\u2019t the first time Gru had come to challenge the beast.\n\nGru already had experience dealing with the wolf. When he saw the creature\u2019s four green lights coming, he pulled out a shield and used it to protect his body.\n\nGru\u2019s shield looked oddly fragile. It resembled a silver mirror, and it seemed like a single punch would be enough to crack it.\n\nBut when those four scary substance chains struck the weird shield, the reflective surface of the glass bounced them away. Gru remained unharmed.\n\n\u201cWhat a strong shield!\u201d Han Sen said in praise.\n\nGru was half-deified, and yet he was able to use his shield to deflect the substance chains of a deified xenogeneic without much difficulty. Clearly, the strange shield was something truly unique.\n\nGru laughed. \u201cMister Xun lent me this deified treasure. This shield can deflect eye skills and visual skills. I borrowed it so I could deal with this four-eyed wolf. It is embarrassing, but the mirror shield can only block the four-eyed wolf\u2019s eyelights. It does not, however, lend me additional speed. And I still can\u2019t block the creature\u2019s physical attacks. I cannot hurt it, and yet, it almost kills me each time.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Gru looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cBrother Han, you have the Apollo Set. With the speed gifted to you by the armor\u2019s wings, you should be able to keep up with the wolf. When it uses its eyelights again, I will use the mirror shield to block. Then, you take that opportunity to swoop in and strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Han Sen nodded. However, Han Sen was silently thinking, \u201cI have just absorbed the ice geno core, which should have given me some new powers. Now I can give it a spin and see what it does.\u201d"
