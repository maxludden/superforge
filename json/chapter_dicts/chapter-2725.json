    "text": "A powerful elite like that gave Han Sen a lot of inspiration. The most special thing about it was the ability of the monkey to clone itself.\n\nNot even Han Sen could tell when the monkey was using its true self or its copy during the battle. The real monkey and the fakes were far too difficult to distinguish. Anyone who wasn\u2019t careful would certainly end up falling for its tricks.\n\nBut Han Sen was hesitating, trying to decide if he should help Shale. Eventually, a Very High man approached him. Han Sen jerked slightly in surprise when he saw the man; he hadn\u2019t noticed when the Very High man arrived next to him.\n\n\u201cLi Chun Qiu?\u201d Han Sen recognized the man upon seeing his face.\n\nLi Chun Qiu was very famous amongst the Very High. He was the elder brother of Exquisite and the others. He was very talented, and no one in the Very High could match him. Not even Li Keer, who had a ten armor talent.\n\nLi Chun Qiu watched Shale and the monkey doing battle, and he said, \u201cDo not help him. He must experience this fight himself.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard those words, he relaxed. Evidently, he didn\u2019t need to bother helping Shale.\n\nShale was at a disadvantage, but he wasn\u2019t too injured to continue fighting just yet. He was still holding his own against the six-eared monkey. And as time went by, Shale began to take fewer and fewer wounds.\n\nLi Chun Qiu had just been standing there quietly watching the fight, but he suddenly said, \u201cWhat do you think of Shale\u2019s recent improvements?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked around. He was the only person nearby. Clearly, Li Chun Qiu had to be talking to him. But Li Chun Qiu was still watching the fight, and he hadn\u2019t looked at Han Sen while he asked the question.\n\n\u201cHe has improved very quickly. It makes sense that he has an eleven armor talent,\u201d Han Sen said. And it was truthful, mostly. Shale\u2019s improvements did impress him.\n\nLi Chun Qiu didn\u2019t move. As he watched the battle unfold, he said, \u201cThis blonde monkey is an ancient xenogeneic called the Six-Eared Macaque. Its genes are very strong, and it is born with a ten armor talent. And its flesh is so powerful. Its mind is very tricky to discern. It is always hard to tell whether you\u2019re looking at the real monkey or another fake. It is hard to find an enemy like this at the same level. Even Shale, who is a born deified, cannot beat the Six-Eared Macaque easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Brother Shale\u2019s power, he simply needs a little time. He will beat the Six-Eared Macaque eventually,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nLi Chun Qiu nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. The Six-Eared Macaque is a small task for Shale. Taking it down won\u2019t be very difficult.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of that, Li Chun Qiu finally turned to look at Han Sen. He said, \u201cActually, the only person that can be considered a serious obstacle to Shale is you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must be joking, sir. I\u2019m just a half-deified. I don\u2019t have what it would take to impede Shale\u2019s growth.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t going to accept some random compliment to boost his ego.\n\nLi Chun Qiu didn\u2019t reply to that. He went on to say, \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the Very High\u2019s Good Fortune Pool. If you need to, I can let you visit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Han Sen asked, struggling to follow the conversation. Li Chun Qiu jumped around a lot when he spoke. He had just been describing Han Sen as Shale\u2019s biggest impediment, and now he was telling Han Sen that he could go to the Very High\u2019s Good Fortune Pool.\n\nOpportunities to enter the Very High\u2019s Good Fortune Pool weren\u2019t granted to everyone. Han Sen had heard about the pool before he even came to the Very High. Even Exquisite and Li Keer had never received approval to enter it. Therefore, Han Sen hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to go there.\n\nNow, Li Chun Qiu was offering him the opportunity to go. It was confusing.\n\nLi Chun Qiu knew what Han Sen was thinking, so he coldly said, \u201cYou have become Shale\u2019s demon. If he cannot beat you for real, it will be an impediment to his growth and ascension. He might lose the chance to become a true god. So, I hope you can become deified soon. Then, Shale will have a chance to defeat the demon that ravages his soul.\u201d\n\nLi Chun Qiu seemed to think that even if Han Sen became deified, Shale could probably beat him. But Han Sen didn\u2019t mind that.\n\nHan Sen was used to other people being arrogant around him. Where was the harm in letting someone else be a bit cocky?\n\n\u201cIf you are really making this offer, then thank you very much, sir. When can I go to the Very High\u2019s Good Fortune Pool, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d Han Sen wanted to pin this down as quickly as he could.\n\nAfter all, Han Sen still had another two geno arts he needed to raise to half-deified. Maybe he could use the Very High\u2019s Good Fortune Pool to break through with them.\n\nThe Good Fortune Pool of the Very High was quite mysterious. It could increase the potency of one\u2019s genes and blood exponentially. Han Sen had wanted to go there for some time, and now this was his chance.\n\n\u201cTake this Good Fortune Spell. After today, you can go whenever.\u201d Li Chun Qiu handed Han Sen a small spell.\n\nHan Sen accepted the spell, and he noticed that the object was only two fingers in width. It looked crystal clear, and it said Good Fortune on it in an ancient language.\n\n\u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m going to try to become deified so that Brother Shale can put his demons to sleep.\u201d Han Sen put the Good Fortune Spell in his chest pocket. Then, he smiled at Li Chun Qiu. Inside, however, he was thinking, \u201cThe Very High really are quite rich. He is just randomly giving permission for someone to enter the Good Fortune Pool. And in a way, he gave it to an enemy.\u201d\n\nLi Chun Qiu glanced at Han Sen with interest, and he said, \u201cYou are a really interesting character. If it wasn\u2019t for Shale and Yu Shanxin, I would say you were the most interesting silkworm in this generation.\u201d\n\nLi Chun Qiu\u2019s words seemed to indicate that he thought Han Sen was weaker than Shale and Yu Shanxin. Within that generation of silkworms, he was only number three.\n\nHan Sen was in no mood to argue, though. In a way, he was quite happy.\n\nAs the two of them talked, Shale had become more and more stable. The Six-Eared Macaque no longer had the advantage, and it was on the verge of being suppressed by Shale. Its real and fake bodies were no longer confusing Shale.\n\nHan Sen had to admit that Shale was a genius. In a short amount of time, he had been able to study the Six-Eared Macaque.\n\nHan Sen suddenly thought of a question about the Six-Eared Macaque. He looked at Li Chun Qiu and asked, \u201cMister, how did you know which Star Fruit held the Six-Eared Macaque?\u201d\n\nExquisite and Li Keer told him that the xenogeneics inside a Star Fruit couldn\u2019t be guessed from the outside. But Li Chun Qiu and Shale obviously knew what to expect from the fruit they had chosen. They knew it would be the Six-Eared Macaque.\n\n\u201cThe Very High Sense can grant a useful predictive ability,\u201d Li Chun Qiu answered. \u201cI spent some time looking over this tree thoroughly, and after much deliberation, I came to the realization of where this creature lay. Plus, this Star Fruit was born strangely. It was easy for me to guess what was inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorn strangely?\u201d Han Sen tilted his head to the side as he looked at Li Chun Qiu.\n\n\u201cWhen this fruit was formed, a weird, gold shadow fell over the Star Tree. I wasn\u2019t too far away from the Star Tree when I saw this strange scene. Based on what I saw, it wasn\u2019t difficult for me to determine what xenogeneic might have been found in that fruit,\u201d Li Chun Qiu said levelly."
