    "text": "Han Sen raised his head and saw a Feather woman standing beside him. She had blue eyes and blonde hair. Her snow- white wings were very attractive, and the gorgeous curves of her body were difficult to look away from.\n\nHan Sen looked around and noticed that all the tables were taken. There weren\u2019t many empty seats in the establishment.\n\nBarr was occupying a table all by his lonesome, but no one wished to sit with him.\n\n\u201cAs you please,\u201d Han Sen said casually. Then he proceeded to ignore the Feather woman\u2019s presence as he went back to scoffing down his meal.\n\nSomething seemed to be very wrong. The atmosphere of the place held a subtle tension, and he had the sneaking suspicion that something awry was on the verge of happening. He planned to stay there and watch whatever event was about to unfold.\n\nThe Feather woman ordered something to eat, but she didn\u2019t talk much. She just sat where she was quietly, and when the meal came, she began eating without making a sound.\n\nMany creatures came into the restaurant, but there were no more tables for them. They filtered through the building, looking for a spot to sit near someone else of the same race. When someone couldn\u2019t find a seat, they stood by the wall instead of leaving.\n\nFinally, a Duke with the head of a bull arrived. He and a few of his kind moved over to the Extreme King woman\u2019s table. They didn\u2019t say anything, and they just reached for chairs.\n\nHan Sen knew that what happened next would be entertaining.\n\n\u201cGet lost,\u201d the Extreme King woman barked before the bull-headed men had settled themselves.\n\n\u201cYoung one, don\u2019t be so cocky. That won\u2019t turn out well for you,\u201d the bull-headed Duke looked on her coldly. He had no intention of heeding the Extreme King\u2019s warning. He smiled as he pulled out a seat for himself.\n\n\u201cD*mn it,\u201d Han Sen sighed. He knew those bull-headed people were brainless. Even if the Duke didn\u2019t know that she belonged to Extreme King, he should have known something was off when he saw one woman sitting by herself while every other table was packed to the gills with other people. And on top of asking for a seat, he dared to provoke her with harsh words.\n\nAs the bull-headed Duke sat down, the woman moved her arm. Before the bull-headed man realized what had happened, he had been sent flying.\n\nPang!\n\nThe Duke\u2019s airborne flight sent him crashing through a wall. He flew out of the hotel\u2019s restaurant and skidded across the ground. He struggled to get back to his feet, and blood spilled out of his mouth.\n\nEveryone looked at the Extreme King woman in shock. The other bull-headed men in her proximity lurched back in fright, then started to run off. They picked up the injured bull-headed Duke and fled without saying a word.\n\nAlthough the bull-headed Duke was not a real elite, a minor slap from the woman had almost killed him. She obviously possessed a disturbing amount of power.\n\nQing Li sat down and quietly told Han Sen, \u201cRight now, every race is thinking that the traitor is hiding someplace in Steel City. They are checking around everywhere in the hopes of finding him. The bull-heads and the Destroyed seem to have a connection, too. If I am guessing correctly, they were sent here to test that woman. No one expected the woman to be so strong, and so they\u2019re wondering if she is the traitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know where the traitor comes from?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nQing Li thought for a moment. \u201cThe one that betrayed the Destroyed isn\u2019t actually one of the Destroyed himself. He was an outsider that joined them. The Destroyed did not say which race the person belongs to, so we have no clue who it might be. According to our investigation, the traitor\u2019s race has yet to be determined. And there\u2019s a good chance that the traitor can shapeshift into any race.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Qing Li looked at the Feather woman. Her eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion.\n\nHan Sen nodded and asked, \u201cDo you know what treasure the traitor stole?\u201d\n\nQing Li nodded and said, \u201cThere is some news, but I\u2019m not sure whether or not it is the truth. It looks like the traitor stole a deified treasure called the Destroyed Bible. That is why the Destroyed are so on edge. They really need to find that traitor and reclaim the Destroyed Bible. All the races are looking for the treasure as well. That is why the situation has become so complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did this nugget of information come from?\u201d Han Sen looked at her queerly.\n\n\u201cNo one knows the original source, but the topic is being discussed everywhere.\u201d Qing Li looked confused, and then she went on to ask Han Sen, \u201cDo you think it isn\u2019t true?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering. Maybe the traitor released the news himself, hoping to stir up all this chaos. That might be the way he has managed to survive. Otherwise, something so secretive wouldn\u2019t have spread so quickly. This is just a guess, of course. I don\u2019t really know much of anything.\u201d\n\nHan Sen paused, and then went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the Destroyed Bible? It sounds like a geno art. Why is it considered a treasure, instead?\u201d\n\nQing Li looked at Han Sen in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of the Destroyed Bible? It\u2019s a Destroyed treasure. The story goes that when the Destroyed alpha died, his xenogeneic gene became a deified treasure. And it also contains the Destroyed alpha\u2019s powers. Inheriting that power is very difficult, however. No one can really understand it, so they can\u2019t make use of the Destroyed Bible\u2019s power.\n\nEven so, the Destroyed Bible is still their most important treasure. They cherish it because it represents their race as a whole. So, the Destroyed really want the Destroyed Bible back. They won\u2019t allow any other race to take it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t speak, but to himself, he was thinking, \u201cA deified treasure sounds valuable indeed. Especially if it carries the power of a Destroyed alpha. It is no wonder that everyone seems to be after it. Even I fancy poking around for it now. But with that being said, anyone who takes it would find much ire directed at them by the Destroyed.\u201d\n\nHan Sen noticed that the Destroyed Marquises and Dukes were staring at Zero, Han Meng\u2019er, Little Angel, and the Feather woman. Their eyes were intent.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped, and he thought to himself, \u201cDid they find out that the traitor that stole the Destroyed Bible was not a man, but in fact\u2026 a woman?\u201d\n\nAnd then, Han Sen looked at the Feather woman. If the traitor was a woman, then the Feather woman really did seem suspicious. She was all alone, after all.\n\nAs he looked at her, Han Sen became more and more intrigued. The woman\u2019s presence seemed like an ordinary Feather Marquise on the surface, but when Han Sen scanned her with his Dongxuan Aura, her aura seemed like nothing more than a disguise. That woman\u2019s presence actually ran really deep. It possessed a depth Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Aura could not even reach.\n\n\u201cIs she the real traitor of the Destroyed?\u201d Han Sen guessed."
