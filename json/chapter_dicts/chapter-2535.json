    "text": "\u201cWhat the f*ck is going on?\u201d Bai Wan Jie was angry and frustrated, but more than anything else, he was simply confused.\n\nGold Armor General had been killed by Dollar and Dragon One. Why would it have appeared here, all of a sudden? And on top of that, it had taken the Sea Sky Eye\u2019s core gene and the Sky God Pillar.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t uncommon for there to be multiple of the same type of xenogeneic in the core area, but if there had been a second deified Gold Armor General, someone would have noticed.\n\nBai Wan Jie could only think of one possibility. Although it was hard to believe, he couldn\u2019t think of any other reasonable explanations for what had happened.\n\n\u201cDollar? Where is Dollar?\u201d\n\nLi Keer\u2019s mouth was hanging open, and she showed no signs of remembering to close it.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t been sure where Han Sen had gone when he sneaked away from their chess match, but she had assumed he had headed toward the battleground. Because of that, she had been keeping a careful eye on the events of the battle. Seeing the gold general destroy the Sea Sky Eye and steal the Sky God Pillar had been a shock for her, too.\n\nShe knew that Gold Armor General had been killed by Dollar, so seeing the Gold Armor General show up again had been unexpected, to say the least.\n\nBut her shock was different from Bai Wan Jie\u2019s. Li Keer kept staring at the spot where the Gold Armor General had vanished. When the Gold Armor General flew away from the battlefield, she had lost her ability to sense it. She couldn\u2019t feel any trace of its presence.\n\n\u201cWas that Dollar?\u201d Li Keer knew the Gold Armor General had to be connected to Dollar in some capacity. There was more chance of that than of it being under Bai Wan Jie\u2019s control, at least. Li Keer was certain it was Dollar because he was the only person she knew who could evade being picked up by the Very High Sense. Aside from Dollar, Li Keer was confident that no one in this system could commit such an act and then escape her senses.\n\nNot long after, Li Keer saw the Dollar sitting in front of her become blurry for a moment. If she wasn\u2019t right in front of Dollar, she wouldn\u2019t even have noticed when his real body returned from the battlefield.\n\nLi Keer looked at Han Sen and opened her mouth to say something, but before she could speak, Bai Wan Jie rushed up and surrounded them with a contingent of his royal knights. \u201cDollar, hand over the Sea Sky Eye core gene and the Sky God Pillar,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said while looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cMy Prince, you must be looking for the wrong person.\u201d Han Sen raised his head and coldly met the man\u2019s stare.\n\n\u201cGive me the core gene and the Sky God Pillar. Then, we can pretend nothing happened, and I will still owe you a favor,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said with a frown.\n\nHan Sen opened his palms wide and said, \u201cCrown prince, I would certainly enjoy it if you owed me a favor, but I really don\u2019t have the core gene or the Sky God Pillar. I\u2019ve never even seen the things you are speaking about.\u201d\n\nBai Wan Jie coldly looked at Han Sen. He could not be sure if Gold Armor General was related to Dollar, but the Extreme King had paid a lot for what they had just lost. They even wasted an Ancient God Statue. He couldn\u2019t just let it go and return to his people with nothing\n\n\u201cIn that case, you\u2019ll need to come with us and explain the situation to our people,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said slowly, staring at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDo you Extreme Kings really enjoy throwing your weight around that much? Just because you told us not to come close to the battleground, I obliged, My Prince. When your people approached me, I turned around and left as requested. Now, you haven\u2019t even thanked me. And what\u2019s more, you\u2019re trying to accuse me of stealing your stuff. What kind of person do you think I am?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s voice had grown chilly, and his face was darkening.\n\nBai Wan Jie had already spoken to the two half-deifieds he set to guard Dollar, so he knew that Dollar was speaking the truth. But Dollar was the one who had killed the Gold Armor General. And it had appeared in the battleground and stolen the Sea Sky Eye core gene and the Sky God Pillar. The entire situation was way too coincidental, which was why Bai Wan Jie refused to believe there was no connection between the thief and Dollar.\n\n\u201cYou think too much. I\u2019d just like you to help investigate this crime. Please, do a favor for the Extreme King and come with us,\u201d Bai Wan Jie said, his voice becoming less accusatory. He was still suspicious, though, and he wouldn\u2019t let it go easily.\n\nPlus, there was too much that he didn\u2019t know about Dollar, anyway. He was going to take the strange man back to the Extreme King no matter what.\n\nLi Keer knew it was her time to say something. Dollar was being pushed to the edge, but all she had to do was reveal her true self. If she did that, Bai Wan Jie would leave. Then, Dollar would be impressed by who she was and owe her a favor. It was a two birds with one stone opportunity.\n\nLi Keer narrowed her eyes. She was going to say something, but Han Sen laughed and said, \u201cBai Wan Jie, do you think that all other races are merely slaves of the Extreme King? Do you think others must do whatever you bid them to? You think far too highly of your heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe universe doesn\u2019t belong to us, but you still have to come with us today.\u201d Bai Wan Jie stood as still as a statue, and he continued to glare down on Han Sen.\n\nMany of the Extreme King knights drew closer. They built a formation to block all of Han Sen\u2019s potential escape routes. Whenever Bai Wan Jie gave the command, they would use their powers against Dollar in tandem, the same way they had fought against the Sea Sky Eye. Even if Dollar had the power to fight a deified elite, their powers would allow them to stand up to him.\n\nHan Sen was still sitting in front of the chessboard with a chess piece in his hand. He paid little attention to the royal knights, and his mind was clearly still focused on his next move.\n\n\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m going to have to force you back,\u201d Bai Wan Jie growled.Before he could give the command, Nightmare Knight had already activated his heart area. The King class knights unleashed their powers in sequence, layering their areas over Han Sen and Li Keer. The scary powers seemed demonic, and it suddenly felt like some unimaginable apocalypse was bearing down upon them.\n\n\u201cThis is good. I won\u2019t save Dollar until the Extreme King has pushed him to the brink. My last-minute rescue will be even more staggering,\u201d Li Keer smugly thought.\n\nThose scary areas came down with enough power to destroy an entire planet. And all the while, Han Sen continued to deliberate his chess move without a care in the world.\n\nRed, orange, yellow, green, chartreuse, blue, and purple areas spread out around them. Wind, fire, thunder, and lightning; all kinds of overwhelming powers roared. Knives, swords, spears, and axes were breaking the sky as they came. Attacks were surging toward Han Sen from all directions.\n\nBut Han Sen still sat where he was without moving. It was like the enormous wave of lethal power didn\u2019t even exist. Han Sen\u2019s brow was furrowed in thought, as if the chess game in front of him was more important than anything\n\nLi Keer frowned. When she saw that Han Sen was giving no indication that he wanted to move, she hadn\u2019t a clue about what he was planning to do.\n\nAs that tsunami of power prepared to crash down across him, Han Sen set his chess piece down on the chessboard. The chess piece clicked, loud and clear, as it touched down on the chessboard.\n\nThat crunchy, striking sound was like a switch getting flicked. The moment the chess piece came down, the roaring rain, wind, thunder, sword lights, knife lights, and scary areas vanished. The attacks became shadows, then faded entirely."
