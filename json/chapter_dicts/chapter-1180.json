He tried to extract the thing from his body.\n\nBut it turned out Han Sen didn\u2019t have the thing inside him. He initially thought Dragon King must have gotten something wrong or had taught him incorrectly. But when Han Sen tried it on Zhang Yuchen and the others, the method worked. For some reason, the thing just couldn\u2019t exist inside Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nDragon King was shocked by the discovery, too. He expected Han Sen to show much appreciation and reward him; little did he expect that Han Sen wouldn\u2019t even need such knowledge.\n\n\u201cNot bad.\u201d Han Sen still gave him a small compliment for the tip.\n\nWhile Han Sen might have been okay, there were still many humans inside Immortal Shelter. He wanted to save as many of them as he could. Han Sen went out to find Zhang Yuchen and many of the others, and he helped them break the contract with their spirits.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s reputation and status, and the backing of Dry Bone King and Baby Ghost, everyone was freed except for Qiu Ping. Everyone else had signed a contract with a royal spirit, but Qiu Ping had signed a contract with Qing Jun King directly.\n\nHan Sen sent them all to his underground shelter, while he remained inside the Sky Tree. This was because Qiu Ping was still under contract, and Han Sen wanted a few more goodies before leaving. If the tree grew, everyone there would be food\u2014super creatures included. And with seven mighty super creatures there, Han Sen thought it\u2019d be a waste.\n\nOne more question lingered on Han Sen\u2019s mind, as well: who left him the slip of paper? He asked all the humans he had rescued, but none were likely candidates.\n\n\u201cDid a king spirit or super creature write it, maybe?\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t have a clue, much to his annoyance.\n\nBut Han Sen was also willing to stay due to Little Angel\u2019s finished evolution. Seeing the halo ring\u2019s buff, Han Sen knew she had to be incredibly powerful.\n\nAnd with Disloyal Knight also there for backup, it gave Han Sen the courage to hang around.\n\nIn his private room there, Han Sen was practicing when all of a sudden, someone barged through his door. It was Qing Jun King, and she approached with great anger.\n\nShe immediately shouted, \u201cWhere did you hide Zhang Yuchen?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a king spirit, aren\u2019t you? Why do you care so much about a human?\u201d Han Sen responded.\n\n\u201cThat is none of your business. Give him to me!\u201d Qing Jun King said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have him,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cDo you really want me to become your enemy?\u201d Qing Jun King asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy, but it\u2019s true. I really don\u2019t have him,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Qing Jun gave Han Sen one last cold stare, then marched out.\n\nDry Bone and Baby Ghost had arrived just in time to see the commotion. Dry Bone looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYou really made her mad this time.\u201d\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cWhy does she care about him, a human, so much?\u201d\n\nDry Bone answered, \u201cYou may not understand. It has to do with her practice of a skill; it is called \u2018Love.\u2019 Humans can become far more emotional than spirits, so Qing Jun selected Qiu Ping and Zhang Yuchen as her target for this. If Qiu Ping kills Zhang Yuchen on her behalf, and she then kills Qiu Ping, her practice with the skill will be complete. But\u2026\u201d\n\nDry Bone King broke out in laughter.\n\n\u201cBut what?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBaby Ghost continued the speech, saying, \u201cBut Qiu Ping is smart. He genuinely liked her, but he wasn\u2019t willing to kill Zhang Yuchen for her. He knows about her plan, and he has known for a very long time. He just pretends he doesn\u2019t know anything. This entire thing has been going on for twenty years. She has grown impatient, over the course of that time, due to her being unable to finish the skill herself.\u201d\n\nDry Bone then said, \u201cShe knows she has failed, but she is a spirit. Pride is as important for her as it is for us. She will never admit it. Now that you have sent him away, though, the slim chance for a future success may have well-and-truly disappeared. It angers her, and she won\u2019t let you slip away so easily.\u201d\n\nHan Sen now fully understood why she cared about the humans so much.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019ll do? What can she do? Is she going to try to kill me with her seven super creatures?\u201d Han Sen wondered out loud.\n\nQing Jun King was only a spirit with nine of her gene locks open. With Little Angel ready to be unleashed, Han Sen wasn\u2019t afraid at all.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t do that. Mister Immortal won\u2019t allow her to hurt anyone. The extent of her command starts and ends with manual labor. They aren\u2019t her pets or anything,\u201d Dry Bone reassured Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen knew Sky King needed them as food, so it was likely true. He wouldn\u2019t allow them to kill each other over squabbles of their own.\n\n\u201cThen what is there to worry about?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nDry Bone King answered, \u201cTo be honest, me and Baby Ghost don\u2019t have what it takes to fight her together.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is that good?\u201d Han Sen was surprised upon hearing this.\n\n\u201cYes. Why else would she be the one in charge? It\u2019s why you need to exercise some caution and be careful,\u201d Baby Ghost replied.\n\n\u201cThanks for the information, you two. I\u2019ll definitely try to be more careful,\u201d Han Sen said. After sending Dry Bone and Baby Ghost away, Han Sen noticed another slip of paper on his table.\n\n\u201cDid one of them just leave this without me realizing it?\u201d Han Sen looked on the back of the paper first and saw another Nine-Life Cat symbol."
