    "text": "Han Sen looked at the Ghost Bone Mask, and he saw it create a connection with his simulated Ghost Bone power.\n\n\u201cThis Ghost Bone Mask is one of the weaker ones, but gaining its allegiance in a single month is excellent progress. We still have time. Practice some more to build confidence with the mask. And\u2026\u201d Fox Queen turned to point at a different mask. \u201cIf you can forge a connection with this Ghost Bone Mask instead, killing the xenogeneic should come easy.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the mask Fox Queen was indicating. He used his Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine it. It was indeed the strongest Ghost Bone Mask there. Its powers surpassed those of the other masks by a substantial margin.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this Ghost Bone Mask different from the others?\u201d Han Sen asked, pretending he hadn\u2019t noticed its strength.\n\nFox Queen said, \u201cThey are all half-deified xenogeneic skulls, but some of the creatures were stronger than others. That Ghost Bone Mask is made from the skull of a demon of hell. Ghost Bone spent a lot of time and effort on that one. And I do mean a lot. Its powers were almost deified. It is the strongest Ghost Bone Mask here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a xenogeneic King that I need to kill. No matter how strong it is, the power of something half-deified will surely be enough to kill it. I can just use the mask that I\u2019ve already claimed.\u201d Han Sen raised his hand toward the Ghost Bone Mask he had already established a connection with, and the mask flew over to him. He clutched it in his hands.\n\nBefore he had Ghost Bone powers, simply touching the mask had sent Han Sen shooting back into a wall. Now that he could hold the mask freely, he could get a real sense of its overwhelming power.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a good look at the mask, then he settled it on his face.\n\nAs soon as it touched his face, power surged into Han Sen\u2019s body. The new energy swelled through Han Sen\u2019s Ghost Bone powers, increasing their might dramatically.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s face went pale, and worry clenched his stomach. He wanted to take the mask off, but it was now too late to do so. A powerful will roared out of the mask and swept inside Han Sen. It prevented Han Sen from moving a single inch. The Ghost Bone power was like a tsunami rushing through him. Han Sen\u2019s body turned black, and a ghostly aura surrounded him.\n\nThe will of the mask was demonic, and it felt like everything around them would fall under its spell. It suppressed Han Sen\u2019s own will, and it coldly said, \u201cThis body isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s not too bad. I suppose I can make use of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are General Ghost Bone?\u201d Han Sen had realized whose Ghost Bone Mask this was. He wasn\u2019t scared, though. He had known there was something off with the item, and he just hadn\u2019t been able to determine the precise nature of the issue. At least he knew his feelings hadn\u2019t been led astray.\n\nGhost Bone powers kept pumping into Han Sen\u2019s body. General Ghost Bone\u2019s will leaned on Han Sen\u2019s like a mountain.\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone\u2019s soul was inside Han Sen\u2019s head. \u201cYes, I am Ghost Bone King. Thanks to your help, I will now be able to manifest through your body. If you have something you want to do before your death, and it isn\u2019t too problematic, I can help you with it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Sutra to stop simulating the Ghost Bone power. The Ghost Bone powers that were surging into his body screeched to a halt.\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone seemed surprised. \u201cYou didn\u2019t practice the Ghost Bone Technique! But even so, you can make use of its power? That is quite tricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy body isn\u2019t a Ghost Bone Body, so why do you want to use it?\u201d Han Sen asked emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a Duke, so I can make your body a Ghost Bone Body with minimal effort. And yes, I am going to make use of your body!\u201d General Ghost Bone growled, his voice hard. He stopped trying to suppress Han Sen\u2019s will, but the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost Bone Mask became stronger.\n\nThe black Ghost Bone power settled over Han Sen\u2019s every cell, and it made his genes look different.\n\nHan Sen cast Jadeskin, and he turned into a jade statue. The Ghost Bone powers sank into him slowly, but they couldn\u2019t change the shape of his body.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve practiced an invincible body? That is very rare!\u201d General Ghost Bone seemed even more surprised now. His voice sounded greedy, and the Ghost Bone power from the Ghost Bone Mask became even stronger.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Jadeskin body was strong, but it couldn\u2019t withstand the power of General Ghost Bone. The power bearing down on him was deified. His Jadeskin body began to transform into bone. He was starting to take on the shape of a black bone statue.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t fight off General Ghost Bone\u2019s power, but at the same time, General Ghost Bone couldn\u2019t overcome and defeat his will.\n\n\u201cGeneral Ghost Bone, do you know anything about a town located in a desert called Ghost Bone Town?\u201d Han Sen asked suddenly.\n\n\u201cYou have been there?\u201d General Ghost Bone said.\n\n\u201cThe place is called Ghost Bone Town, so why is a statue of you standing guard before a gate? And who does the statue inside the palace belong to? Is that the leader of Sacred?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to die, and this is what you\u2019re spending your energy on?\u201d General Ghost Bone asked in wonder.\n\n\u201cWell, if I am dying, I don\u2019t want to leave this mortal plane with unanswered questions,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cI will tell you; it is where the leader was resting,\u201d General Ghost Bone explained as he continued changing Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mausoleum of some sort? Whose statue is in the palace? How did he end up there?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone seemed to sneer coldly. \u201cMaybe he deserved it?\u201d\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone seemed to harbor disdain for the Human King, but he didn\u2019t say anything about who he actually was.\n\n\u201cThen who is he? And why is his statue there in the palace?\u201d Han Sen kept asking.\n\n\u201cYou are a dead man. You don\u2019t need to know so much!\u201d General Ghost Bone didn\u2019t want to talk. All he wanted to do was morph Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body turned from black to white. He became a being of white bone, which looked very strange.\n\nThe black bone power was very evil, but now, it turned to white bone. And it didn\u2019t seem so evil anymore. There was some sunny air inside him.\n\n\u201cI found a special stone plate inside the palace; do you know what that is?\u201d Han Sen asked. Han Sen had many questions, and it seemed as if only General Ghost Bone could give him the answer he sought.\n\nGeneral Ghost Bone paused. Even the Ghost Bone powers that were changing Han Sen came to a halt. The question had obviously stunned General Ghost Bone.\n\n\u201cYou found the relic? Why do you have it?\u201d General Ghost Bone quickly asked.\n\n\u201cI have it with me right now. What is the relic? What does it do?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHaha! God is helping me right now, for sure. With this relic, I can access the item located inside that holy monument. My Ghost Bone era is on its way.\u201d General Ghost Bone laughed like a madman inside Han Sen\u2019s brain."
