    "text": "Ancient Devil gave Han Sen a predatory grin. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard about dying and then being reborn? If you don\u2019t die, how are you supposed to dodge Super Space Slash?\u201d\n\nHan Sen had heard of rebirth before, but he didn\u2019t know what it had to do with Super Space Slash. He wanted to find a way to counter Super Space Slash because he wanted to live. What was the point of killing himself?\n\nAncient Devil pointed at Han Sen and said, \u201cBefore, we all swore to die like it was yesterday. And after, swore to live like today. Today, you are still alive. Then, what is the difference if you were to die yesterday?\u201d\n\nAs he listened to Ancient Devil, Han Sen felt like he was lost in an impenetrable fog. He had no idea what Ancient Devil was talking about, but he knew that continuing to ask wouldn\u2019t improve the situation. Unless he agreed to let Ancient Devil go, of course. Otherwise, Ancient Devil would continue to avoid reaching the crux of the matter and explaining what was required to break Super Space Slash. Although in truth, the hints that Han Sen had received thus far weren\u2019t all that bad.\n\nAfter leaving Destiny\u2019s Tower, Han Sen thought about what Ancient Devil had said to him. He still couldn\u2019t understand what the man was saying.\n\n\u201cSuicide\u2026 and dying yesterday\u2026 Being alive today\u2026 What is Ancient Devil trying to tell me?\u201d Han Sen spent a long time thinking the matter over, but he couldn\u2019t quite figure it out. It felt like the concept was just beyond reach.\n\nSuddenly, an invisible shockwave rolled through the air. Two shadows emerged from a quickly-gathering mist, and they landed on the plaza of the palace.\n\n\u201cExquisite and Li Keer are finally here!\u201d Han Sen exulted, once he looked closer to confirm that it was them. Ever since he had been locked up in this bottle world, he hadn\u2019t seen hide nor hair of Li Keer or Exquisite.\n\nAs both of them walked before him now, Han Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He knew Exquisite and Li Keer were only youngsters among the Very High. They wouldn\u2019t be allowed to make any important decisions. Even if they wanted to free Han Sen, they didn\u2019t have the authority.\n\n\u201cThe scales across your body are gone!\u201d Li Keer gasped, looking Han Sen over.\n\n\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know why, but the scales just vanished. Can you ask the leader if I can leave now?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nExquisite and Li Keer looked at each other. It was as if they wanted to tell him something, but they were hesitant to actually say it. In the end, Exquisite ended up saying, \u201cThe leader still wants you to stay in the bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean he\u2019s going to keep me bottled up in here forever?\u201d Han Sen said with a frown.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Li Keer assured him. \u201cWe will try our best to show everyone that you aren\u2019t a threat. We will try to get your freedom back as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy body no longer possesses the scales. Doesn\u2019t that help erase any suspicions they have about me?\u201d Han Sen pointed out, but his voice didn\u2019t sound particularly hopeful.\n\nExquisite sighed. \u201cIf the scales had been removed by my people, of course, they wouldn\u2019t remain suspect. But now it seems that the scales have simply disappeared by themselves. I\u2019m afraid the leader and the elders won\u2019t believe that the scales just vanished of their own accord and went away for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means I\u2019m still to be trapped here?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s mind had become placid once again. He didn\u2019t expect the Very High to let him go. He would have to escape using his own power.\n\nLi Keer tried to provide comfort by saying, \u201cWe will try to help you in any way we can. You just need to hold out a little longer, okay?\u201d\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t a rookie who had only just started adventuring. He knew these were just words of comfort that wouldn\u2019t lead to any real changes in his situation.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t leave this place, can you bring me some books so that I\u2019m not completely bored?\u201d Han Sen asked flatly.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of books would you like to read? In a situation like this, I don\u2019t think our people will let you read any kind of geno art,\u201d Li Keer said, as straight as an arrow. She was often like that, telling Han Sen what he needed to know.\n\n\u201cNo geno arts. I just want some books about philosophy and theology. Something about life and death would be best.\u201d Han Sen was hoping that these books might give him inspiration, perhaps revealing what Ancient Devil meant when he spoke of suicide.\n\n\u201cLet me find a way. We will try and get these books for you,\u201d Li Keer answered.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re our silkworm. This is what we should be doing\u2026\u201d Li Keer trailed off halfway and fell silent. Han Sen\u2019s situation now was different. He wasn\u2019t really their silkworm anymore.\n\nBut Han Sen seemed to be doing better than they had expected. The way he casually spoke with them, he didn\u2019t sound as if he was going to be locked up forever.\n\nBefore they left, Exquisite told Han Sen, \u201cI will tell the leader that the scales have disappeared. They will most likely send someone to examine your condition. But I don\u2019t think there is a high chance of you leaving. So, do not put too much hope in getting out soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod. He knew Exquisite had no authority in this matter, so the final say-so wasn\u2019t her decision to make.\n\nNot long after they left, a Very High true god elite appeared before Han Sen. He checked Han Sen out and asked Han Sen some questions. Han Sen had already composed his answers a long time ago, so when he was asked what had happened, he had a story ready to go. The explanation wasn\u2019t entirely perfect because Han Sen kept trying to avoid talking about certain things. The Very High elder couldn\u2019t tell what was going on.\n\nAfter the Very High elder left, no one came to see him for a few days. Han Sen spent the entire time practicing the Sit and Forget Sutra. Time passed rather easily.\n\n\u201cIt has been a while since I saw Yanran and Ling\u2019er. I wonder if Ling\u2019er has grown up yet. And I wonder what is going on with Littleflower. Mom and Dad said they wanted to spend some time traveling. I wonder if they have come back yet\u2026\u201d Sometimes, Han Sen would get distracted as he thought about how much he missed his family.\n\n\u201cThe Sit and Forget Sutra is completely different from Under the Sky. One of them is about entering the world, and the other is about exiting the world. Combining them will be hard. And I have never practiced Very High Sense before, so I have to use Under the Sky as a base. If I start from the beginning with my practice, I don\u2019t know how long it will take for me to learn the Sit and Forget Sutra.\u201d Han Sen had no way of accurately predicting when he would elevate the new skill to a usable level.\n\nThe Sit and Forget Sutra and Under the Sky were similar in structure, but according to the theory, they operated on different wavelengths. They were practically polar opposites. Even though he had managed to obtain the alpha\u2019s experience and mind, he couldn\u2019t combine the two techniques.\n\nWhile Han Sen was stewing in his own frustration, a shadow appeared through the mist surrounding the palace. It was an old Very High man Han Sen wasn\u2019t familiar with.\n\nThe old man didn\u2019t speak. He only tossed something at Han Sen, then turned around and left.\n\nHan Sen raised an eyebrow, having no clue what the old man had just done. He picked up the item and looked it over. It was a mini laptop, about the size of a person\u2019s hand.\n\nHan Sen turned on the computer. He couldn\u2019t connect to the internet, but there were many ebooks inside it.\n\nNow Han Sen understood. This was probably Li Keer and Exquisite\u2019s delivery.\n\nHan Sen browsed quickly through the titles, and he realized that ebooks really were the only things that the computer contained. Most of the books were about philosophy and theology. There wasn\u2019t anything about geno arts, at all.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t really expected to find a geno art, anyway. He flicked through the books. With how much his brain had evolved, it was an easy task for him to memorize the exact contents of a book with a million words. He could recall the content perfectly, without forgetting a single word. Understanding it, however, was something else entirely.\n\n\u201cFlush Real Sutra.\u201d Han Sen jerked when he saw the title of one of the books."
