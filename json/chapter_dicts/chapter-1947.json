    "text": "Ordinary people could not withstand the music, and the chiming of the bell was far more grueling.\n\nEven Seven Spirit himself, who had practiced the Buddha geno art and acquired the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha form, was having a hard time under the bell\u2019s oppression. He was losing control of his body.\n\nHan Sen was a Viscount, and yet he had escaped the music. Seven Spirit could barely believe it.\n\nThe ordinary heavenly music and the bell were not physical attacks; they were more like a torturing of the mind. But this was a department where Han Sen excelled. His will was as strong as a deified elite\u2019s, so he wasn\u2019t affected by the Buddha Heaven\u2019s music.\n\nHe pretended to be affected so he could lure Seven Spirit forward and ensure that the Buddha wouldn\u2019t give up chasing him.\n\nNow, Seven Spirit had fallen under the bell\u2019s influence. And that meant it was time for Han Sen to strike back.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s rabbit shoes were moving in a blur, flinging him forward like a shadow. The Ghost Teeth Knife gave off a purple knifelight as it came swinging at Seven Spirit.\n\nSeven Spirit wished to flee, but as soon as he started to do so, his arm and legs flailed in a dance. His legs weren\u2019t following his commands, and he couldn\u2019t move the way he wanted to.\n\nPang!\n\nThe knifelight was broken by Seven Spirit\u2019s hands. The four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body was quite scary.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face did not change. He kept swinging the Ghost Teeth Knife and using Teeth Knife knife skills. His body continued to flash around Seven Spirit.\n\nSeven Spirit stumbled back, using his eight arms to fight against Han Sen. But at various times, some parts of his body would lose all control. He began to make mistakes he wouldn\u2019t have, otherwise.\n\nA moment was all that it took for him to make a big mistake. Even though Han Sen\u2019s body was inferior to Seven Spirit\u2019s, it was through all those mistakes that Han Sen could discern his flaws.\n\nGhost Teeth Knife\u2019s purple knifelight slashed down on Seven Spirit. It created a spark and left a white mark on his golden body. Then, it disappeared.\n\n\u201cWhat a powerful xenogeneic body!\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He didn\u2019t cast Ghost Teeth Knife\u2019s power a lot, but it was still easy for him to kill an Earl. The fact that he couldn\u2019t leave much of a mark on Seven Spirit\u2019s body spoke volumes about just how scary the Buddha\u2019s body was.\n\nSeven Spirit looked furious. His eyes shone gold, and his eight arms tried to generate a spirit to attack Han Sen. Now his body was losing more and more control, though. Too many of his flaws were being exposed. He couldn\u2019t suppress Han Sen as he had earlier.\n\nHan Sen depended entirely on his rabbit shoes for speed. The Red Mink Gloves gave him increased power. With the two, Ghost Teeth Knife continued to hack at the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body.\n\nBut his attacks could only leave white scrapes across the gold body. The Teeth powers could not latch onto Seven Spirit.\n\nSeven Spirit wished to escape Heaven now, but it was too late. He fell back quickly, but the tolling of the bell was rather frequent. It affected him more and more.\n\nBefore Seven Spirit escaped from Heaven, his body fell completely into the dance. He couldn\u2019t stop that strange dance, and he couldn\u2019t get out of Heaven.\n\nHan Sen was so happy, and he kept slashing at Seven Spirit. Using Jadeskin and Mutant Blood, he began to leave shallow marks on the gold Buddha body.\n\nBut that was enough. If he could leave marks, the Teeth power would slowly start to tear Seven Spirit\u2019s body apart. Although it was slow, over time, it\u2019d be enough for him to kill Seven Spirit and his Buddha body.\n\nSeven Spirit kept roaring with his four faces. He wanted to take control of his body and escape the Buddha Heaven, but his body had been hijacked by the music. Regaining control was a very difficult task.\n\n\u201cWhy is he not affected? Impossible\u2026\u201d Seven Spirit Buddha took another hit from Han Sen. His eyes gleamed gold, and he looked angry.\n\nHan Sen wanted to cut him a few more times before he left that place. When he exited, the marks would kill the felon slowly anyway. But before Han Sen could slash him again, Seven Spirit\u2019s eyes suddenly turned gold. Gold fire flared to life, and it burst out to wrap up Seven Spirit\u2019s body.\n\nThe body that had been affected by the music suddenly became still, thanks to that gold flame. He had stopped dancing.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, I said we would meet again soon.\u201d The four-faced, eight-armed Buddha, which was enveloped in fire, opened its four mouths to speak. A scary voice boomed out.\n\n\u201cQing Jun!\u201d Han Sen now knew who it was. The Sky God had been behind everything this entire time.\n\nSeven Spirit\u2019s mind was completely under the control of Qing Jun. And in his true form, he was not affected by the bell. He cruelly laughed as he walked towards Han Sen. He said, \u201cHan Sen, I have waited a long, long time for this. But don\u2019t worry; I won\u2019t kill you. You are a big delicious meal for one such as 1.1 will feast on your fear, your tears, and your death.\u201d\n\nThe voice of utter contempt echoed in Han Sen\u2019s ears. Han Sen felt terrible, but he brought out the red mist orb.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t deal with Seven Spirit, and now it turned out that he was being possessed by Sky God Qing Jun. There was no way Han Sen could triumph now.\n\nHan Sen planned on using Red Mist King for his final bid. Although Red Mist King had barely any juice left in the tank, he\u2019d kill Seven Spirit if he could land a hit on him.\n\nQing Jung looked so mad as he flared with gold fire. His demonic presence was insufferably strong, and it made the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body look even scarier. It was like he was going to eat people.\n\nBoom!\n\nQing Jun lifted his finger and gathered up a swirl of hot flame atop it. The fire gathered up Seven Spirit\u2019s Buddha light and flame powers. He used it only for a second, and Han Sen felt himself burn.\n\nThe four faces looked to be filled with vile hatred. Qing Jun controlled Seven Spirit\u2019s body. His fingers fired a gold flame towards Han Sen.\n\nBut suddenly, a bag was hanging around Seven Spirit\u2019s neck. The bag was incinerated by the gold fire. There was a yellow spell paper inside, and it was scorched.\n\nWhen it burned, a weird light came out of the ash and went to Seven Spirit\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Han Sen heard a scream. The scream came from Qing Jun."
