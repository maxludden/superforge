    "text": "\u201cBao\u2019er, why don\u2019t you go with Little Auntie?\u201d Han Sen asked Bao\u2019er as they stood before the Sky Door.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Bao\u2019er nodded and flew over to Han Yan. She took Han Yan\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cHey, Auntie. Bao\u2019er is going to walk with you.\u201d\n\nBut before they went onto Sky Door Island, one of the Sky guardsmen stopped their approach. He looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cBrother Han, the leader issued a command that only Sister Han may traverse the Sky Path. Bao\u2019er cannot cross it again.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was frustrated by that, but he couldn\u2019t actively go against a decree issued by Sky Palace Leader himself. So, Bao\u2019er returned to his side.\n\nSky Palace Leader was drinking tea at the time, and he murmured to himself. \u201cIf the gourds rumble again, it will reduce the amount of holy air in the vine. If this happens again, the holy vine will be killed.\u201d Sky Palace Leader had good reason to be protective of the vine. That plant was the root of Sky Palace, and it was used to vet and grow the students that the Sky wished to train. If Bao\u2019er was allowed to cross Sky Path every time Han Sen brought someone to Sky Palace, the holy gourd vine\u2019s power would fall precipitously. If that happened repeatedly, the holy gourd vine would end up destroyed.\n\nLast time Bao\u2019er traversed Sky Path, she had received enough blessings for tens of thousands of average students. They had lost a lot that day, and Sky Palace couldn\u2019t afford another hit like that.\n\nThat aside, the rules of Sky Palace only permitted one person to cross Sky Path at a time. Previously, Bao\u2019er had only been allowed to go with Han Sen because she was so small. But that was why they lost as much as they did. Sky Palace Leader wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen again.\n\nExquisite watched the Sky Path from afar. She wanted to know how talented Han Sen\u2019s biological sister was. Perhaps she could learn more about Han Sen\u2019s real gene talent level.\n\nAn eleven armor talent was too scary. It was difficult to believe that it was a genuine result.\n\n\u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t embarrass you.\u201d Han Yan\u2019s entire purpose in life was to catch up with Han Sen. She looked confident in this.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t exhaust yourself. Just cross it.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t want Han Yan to make a scene when she crossed the Sky Path. Making a name for yourself was never a good thing, he had discovered.\n\nTraversing the Sky Path wasn\u2019t that risky, though; when she ascended the stairs that led to Sky Palace, that was when the opportunity to impress the Sky would present itself. If Han Yan performed extremely well there, she could forget about having a quiet life.\n\nHan Yan didn\u2019t know what Han Sen meant. She thought he was saying that to alleviate the pressure she might have been feeling. \u201cSister Han, you can just stroll across. This is just a small crossing,\u201d Yun Suyi said to comfort Han Yan. She didn\u2019t want her to be nervous.\n\n\u201cThank you, Sister Yun. I\u2019m going now.\u201d Han Yan walked through Sky Door Island. The people of Sky Palace watched her traverse the narrow Sky Path.\n\nHan Yan already knew that going across Sky Path might trigger the holy air of the gourds. So, when she walked across the gourd vine, she stared down at the holy gourds.\n\nThe holy gourds were big and small. They were each cute in their own way, but they showed no sign of activity.\n\n\u201cI have heard Sister Yun say that when Big Brother walked across Sky Path, he didn\u2019t receive the gift of holy air. But he made all the holy gourds shake and shiver. Why is nothing happening while I walk across it?\u201d Han Yan frowned.\n\nShe continued to walk, and still, the holy gourds didn\u2019t so much as twitch.\n\n\u201cOf course, without Bao\u2019er there\u2014that naughty kid\u2014the crystallizer couldn\u2019t have triggered the trembling of a thousand gourds.\u201d Han Yan had already walked halfway, and not a single gourd moved. Sky Palace Leader merrily took another sip of his tea. He liked this.\n\n\u201cBrother Han\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t look like she has any special talents. Not a single gourd has chosen to bless her with holy air yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this world, only one Han is known as God\u2019s Daddy. Not every Han of the crystallizer race can earn a title like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is useless to just be a Han. You should strive to become a God\u2019s Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a shame Bao\u2019er was stopped. If she was there, a thousand gourds might move for Han Yan.\u201d\n\nYun Changkong was a bit disappointed. He had never seen Han Yan before, but still, he had agreed to take her on as a student. He made this decision because she was Han Sen\u2019s biological sister and Yun Suyi had asked him to multiple times.\n\nYun Changkong didn\u2019t expect Han Yan\u2019s power to be as great as her brother\u2019s, but since she was his real sister, he expected something more. He had high expectations, to say the least. Even if a thousand gourds didn\u2019t move, she should have at least received some holy air.\n\nBut right now, it didn\u2019t look as if any holy gourd was going to give her holy air. \u201cAlthough they are both called Han, this one is not Han Sen. Are you disappointed, Elder Yun?\u201d Elder Six was smiling at Yun Changkong as he spoke. Yun Changkong had accepted a foreign student as his own. This was the first exception for an elder to take on someone foreign in Sky Palace. So, Yun Changkong had a lot riding on this.\n\nMany people in Sky Palace were discussing these proceedings, and many whispers regarded Yun Changkong\u2019s petty attempts to please Han Sen. It damaged Sky Palace Leader\u2019s image, by extension. Many weren\u2019t happy with what Yun Changkong had done.\n\nElder Six had spoken in a mocking tone.\n\nOf course, it made sense that the other elders were feeling rather sour. Many elders in Sky Palace wanted to build a relationship with Han Sen, but none of them were as close with him as those of the Yun family. When they heard that Yun Changkong had snatched Han Yan as a student, they didn\u2019t take the news well.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s blessing powers alone made many people want to befriend him, and that wasn\u2019t to mention his ownership of the Charming God\u2019s Jian and the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. Everyone wanted the best students possible, and if they had a few deifieds, their reputation would shift. How many deifieds did Sky Palace have? And how many could become primitive deified in the future? That rank alone was enough for someone to become famous.Exquisite had watched Han Yan walk over half of Sky Path, and not a single gourd had moved to provide her with something. This disappointed her immensely.\n\nExquisite\u2019s knowledge of the gourds was that if a person had an eight armor talent or above, quite a few holy gourds of the same element would give out holy air. She hadn\u2019t received any holy air, though. And that meant her talent had to be below eight armor.\n\nIf Han Sen\u2019s sister had only ordinary talent, then it didn\u2019t matter how much the big brother mutated; there was no way he had an eleven armor talent.\n\nSeeing that Han Yan was just about to finish Sky Path with no result, Han Sen thought it was a shame that Bao\u2019er hadn\u2019t been allowed to join her. Han Yan didn\u2019t have a chance to absorb the holy air of a thousand gourds.\n\nBut this result didn\u2019t surprise Han Sen. After all, no holy gourd had given him holy air when he walked it alone. It was only because Bao\u2019er was there the second time that he received something. She had been the reason that all the gourds released holy air for him.\n\nHe had expected that the gourds might refuse to grant Han Yan anything.\n\nHan Yan\u2019s expression remained impassive. She walked all of the way to the end of Sky Path, ready to leave the holy gourds.\n\nBut then, Han Yan suddenly stopped. At the end of the holy vine, she looked back at the holy gourds on both sides."
