    "text": "Around the same time as the girl broke out of the egg, the human stone in the camp melted like ice. But instead of water, a substance that looked like blood emerged from the melting stone.\n\nThe two guinea pigs inside the warehouse witnessed this happen, and they backed away from the stone with wide eyes. They screamed and turned to run, but when their mouths opened, they stopped mid-stride. Their eyes turned red, and a scary presence came out of them.\n\nMore of that red blood oozed from the stone. It began to rise from the ground as a vapor, spreading to fill the surrounding air.\n\nAll the members of Spring Rain and the workers that were nearby fell under the influence of that invisible power. They all leveled up, their power increasing so quickly that it almost seemed like they were cheating. They increased one level, and their genes grew stronger.\n\nAll of the nearby Kings became half-deified, and the half-deifieds actually downgraded to become measly Dukes.\n\nThe creatures that had already been affected by the stone didn\u2019t change again, but other than those few who had already been altered, there was only one anomaly: Ning Yue. He hadn\u2019t been affected in any capacity.\n\nHis little green sword groaned, then flew up and landed in Ning Yue\u2019s hand. It shone green, bathing him in a protective light.\n\nIn Han Sen\u2019s room, Bao\u2019er was still playing games with Falling Leaf. She looked up suddenly, and her face grew worried. She raised her hand and summoned a little gourd. The little gourd shone with a weird light of its own, covering herself, Falling Leaf, and the little red bird.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Falling Leaf asked, having no idea what Bao\u2019er was actually doing. She saw the shining little gourd, but she didn\u2019t notice any of the other powers that were at play.\n\n\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s continue our card game,\u201d Bao\u2019er said with a blink.\n\nFalling Leaf made no comment, and they resumed their game. Meanwhile, in the warehouse, the stone had completely melted. A white-haired man with white clothing had been revealed, sitting exactly where the stone had been. He looked pale, and he smelled musty and ancient. It was as if he had been sitting there forever, watching the days and the moons go by, and the stars themselves fall to darkness. Time must have moved like a river for him. It was like nothing in the world could leave a mark on him. The rise and fall of empires were mere moments to a man like this.\n\nHe let out a sigh. The man opened his eyes, and then he spoke to himself, \u201cAfter all these lifetimes, I just want to get drunk with you. Is there any point living in this world without you?\u201d\n\nThe white-haired man stood up and exited the warehouse.\n\nThe infected creatures of the base, meanwhile, were in the midst of fighting each other. Their levels had increased or decreased, and their eyes had turned red. They became insane and bloodthirsty, trying to kill anyone they could reach.\n\nAll kinds of powers were being used across the base. If the base hadn\u2019t been built out of the sturdy black rock, it would have been reduced to a ruin by now.\n\nThe white-haired man walked through the various pitched battles, but none of the crazed people attacked him. No power dared to land on him. He slid through the base like a ghost, immaterial and untouchable.\n\nThe man walked out of the base camp and turned his grey eyes up to look at the stars above.\n\nThe buildings behind him began to collapse under the ferocity of the fights, and explosions of power bloomed like fireworks. But the man was wholly uninterested, and he continued talking to himself. \u201cThis world is so boring without you.\u201d\n\nThe white-haired man looked at the base, and his eyes drifted toward Bao\u2019er\u2019s room. Then, his calm eyes suddenly looked shocked.\n\nPang!\n\nFalling Leaf and Bao\u2019er were in the middle of playing card games. Suddenly, a booming noise shook the room, and the walls collapsed like the petals of a flower. But not a single piece of debris came near them.\n\nWhen Falling Leaf looked outside, her eyes opened wide. The entire base was little more than a ruin. Spring Rain members and workers were all mixed together, fighting and killing each other like they\u2019d been possessed. Dead bodies and torn flesh were strewn about in pools of blood.\n\n\u201cAre you guys crazy?\u201d Falling Leaf shouted. But the crazed fighters paid no heed to her cry. They continued butchering each other in a frenzy.\n\nAmidst the killing, the white-haired man walked gracefully toward them. He moved effortlessly through the destruction, and the violence fell away from him like oil over water.\n\nFalling Leaf\u2019s heart leaped inside her chest. She flipped her hand and quickly brought out a dagger. She looked at the white-haired man and said firmly, \u201cStop! If you step closer, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\nThe white-haired man behaved as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. He kept walking toward the room, peering at Bao\u2019er, who was atop the sofa.\n\nShe gave three warnings, but the white-haired man didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Falling Leaf had no idea what was going on, but Miss Mirror had commanded that she look after Bao\u2019er and keep the girl safe, and that was exactly what Falling Leaf would do.\n\nShe thrust her dagger at the white-haired man. Falling Leaf\u2019s entire person seemed to connect with the universe. For a moment she was extending her dagger in an attack, and that moment froze, hovering like an afterimage. Then the afterimage vanished, and the only thing left behind was the sinking feeling of watching yellow leaves fall in late autumn, withered and dying.\n\nThat feeling of death flashed by the white-haired man, harmless. Falling Leaf was back where she had started as if nothing had happened. But Falling Leaf\u2019s pupils grew smaller. Her assassination skills were top-notch, and her full power attacks were a threat to even deified elites. But this man had simply ignored her attack, and he was still headed for Bao\u2019er as if nothing had happened.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Falling Leaf couldn\u2019t believe her eyes as she stared at the white-haired man. Her chest constricted with sudden fear.\n\nShe had no idea how the white-haired man might have broken her strongest attack. Although he didn\u2019t look strong, there was a cold feeling in her stomach. Merely looking at the man gave Falling Leaf the creeps.\n\nThe man never looked at Falling Leaf, though. His attention was focused on Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er grabbed her little gourd. Her face looked very dire, and she stared at the man as if he was an enemy.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe little red bird on Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder seemed to feel that it needed to intervene as well. It flew off of Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder, becoming a scary fire phoenix that hovered right beside the girl. It cried at the white-haired man in warning, but it didn\u2019t attack. It actually looked quite afraid of the white-haired man.\n\n\u201cInteresting. Is this a combination of a phoenix and a fish bird? To be able to do this\u2026 This is quite interesting.\u201d The white-haired man finally averted his gaze from Bao\u2019er to look at the little red bird, intrigued.\n\nFalling Leaf was frozen. She had thought the little red bird on Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder was a useless pet. But the scary presence it now exuded told her that it was actually a deified xenogeneic.\n\nThe next second, an even scarier thing happened. The white-haired man simply reached out and grabbed the fire phoenix out of the air. The bird\u2019s fire vanished, and it didn\u2019t even have a chance to resist. It returned to being that little red bird in his hands, and it couldn\u2019t fly away."
