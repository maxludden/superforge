    "text": "The last time he made a wish in Destiny\u2019s Tower, the statue\u2019s eyes had ended up being destroyed. Now, it seemed as if it might happen again. Perhaps it would have the same effect.\n\nBut even if Empty God\u2019s eyes exploded, it wouldn\u2019t help him much. The statue would still have its power, and it would still threaten Han Sen and shorten his lifespan.\n\n\u201cNo matter what wish I make, unless the black crystal armor attacks him, my lifespan is going to be shortened. Why don\u2019t I ask a question I have always wanted to ask instead? Perhaps I can at least learn some useful information out of this,\u201d Han Sen thought. Then, he looked at Empty God and asked, \u201cCan my wish be a question that you will answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. I can do anything. I can answer any question you seek to ask,\u201d Empty God said coldly.\n\n\u201cI want to know, are you and I the same? Are you a creature of this universe, too? Or do you come from someplace outside the universe? Regardless of the answer, I want to know where God was born,\u201d Han Sen said, posing his question.\n\nEmpty God\u2019s eyes flashed. He looked at Han Sen slowly and said, \u201cAre you sure you want to ask me this question? It is useless for you to know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you already that I don\u2019t lack anything. But I\u2019m curious about you. If you must make me compose a wish, I would like to know this answer,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nEmpty God looked at Han Sen and frowned. \u201cThere were three questions. You can only receive the answer for one.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at the Empty God for a long moment, then asked his ultimate question. \u201cPlease tell me, Empty God. Are you a creature of this universe?\u201d\n\nHan Sen had always been suspicious about God coming from the geno hall. Even mighty beings like the Ancient Water God had been killed in a single blow when they tried to enter the geno hall. The power of the beast within that place was far too shocking. Aside from those who called themselves gods, Han Sen couldn\u2019t think of any other being that possessed such power.\n\nBut if Han Sen asked the god where he was born, Empty God could answer by telling him a name that he wouldn\u2019t recognize. If Han Sen had never heard of the place, then he wouldn\u2019t know if it was in the universe or not. So, Han Sen eventually decided to ask the simplest of questions. He needed to confirm if the god was a creature that came from the geno universe. This was the root of all questions he would later want to ask. With knowledge of its origin, he would have a more solid basis for formulating theories and asking future questions. This was very important.\n\nEmpty God didn\u2019t hesitate this time. He answered straight away. \u201cNo. I am God. I come from God Place.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard the answer, he nodded. The way Empty God said it was so vague. He had, perhaps deliberately, twisted the answer. But Han Sen had still received the answer he had wanted.\n\nGod wasn\u2019t a creature that came from the geno universe. This answer was enough for Han Sen to confirm, at the very least, that the god he was facing was something more than a deified elite. This being was even more almighty.\n\nThese guys called themselves gods. But Han Sen thought they were more like devils that had invaded the ordinary world.\n\nHan Jinzhi and Blood Legion had been dealing with scary beings like this for a long time. The effort they had put in was unimaginable for normal people.\n\nWhen Han Sen received this answer, he felt his power start to fade away. His power drained so rapidly that it actually physically pulled him toward Empty God.\n\nHan Sen had already experienced this before, and he knew it was his lifespan being reduced. But this time, it was fading much faster than it had upon his first wish. He could see his lifespan fading away like an avalanche.\n\nEmpty God looked at Han Sen coldly. A weird light shone around the statue, making him look both godlike and insubstantial at the same time.\n\nA moment later, a century\u2019s worth of lifespan had left Han Sen\u2019s body. It made Han Sen feel tired and worn out. The drain didn\u2019t stop, though. Han Sen was now losing years at an even greater speed.\n\nHan Sen was prepared to give up a lot of his lifespan, so he didn\u2019t mind sacrificing a few years. After all, nabbing secrets right from God\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nHan Sen had already received a big boost to his lifespan from the previous god doll. He could accept this kind of loss.\n\nBut the next second, the black crystal armor inside his Sea of Soul reacted. While Han Sen continued to lose years, the black crystal armor\u2019s mysterious presence exploded with energy. That power spread over Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nThe spreading black crystal armor gave Han Sen a unique feeling. It was as if someone\u2019s presence was surrounding him.\n\nHan Sen was quite familiar with this presence. He tried to think it over, and he finally remembered where he had felt that presence before. It was the same presence he had sensed when the black crystal armor blew up the statue of the previous god.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t have time to think. The black crystal armor glowed with a strange godly light. It flew out of the Sea of Soul, then punched Empty God, who was still sitting atop the stone platform.\n\nEmpty God had been blithely sucking in Han Sen\u2019s lifespan without ever realizing that something like this might happen. Plus, he hadn\u2019t even realized that there was a power out there that could harm him. So, he hadn\u2019t remained vigilant against a sudden attack. He had grown lax in his security.\n\nPang!\n\nWhat Han Sen had witnessed before was now happening again. Under the tremendous force of the crystal armor\u2019s punch, Empty God\u2019s body shattered. A massive surge of lifeforce rose from the crumbling statue.\n\n\u201cLifespan +1\u2026 lifespan +1\u2026\u201d\n\nThe announcement of his lifespan increasing repeated over and over. That new power entered Han Sen\u2019s body, stretching out his potential lifespan.\n\nAt the same moment that the god doll was destroyed, in a hall inside an empty realm, Empty God\u2019s eyes blazed with terrible fury. And he said, \u201cSky armor power\u2026 Sky armor god\u2026 I only destroyed your god doll\u2019s eyes, how dare you destroy my god doll! This isn\u2019t over yet\u2026\u201d\n\nHan Sen had no idea, but due to these meetings, he had started a fight between two gods.\n\nThe black crystal armor returned to Han Sen\u2019s Sea of Soul. Han Sen had gained more than a thousand years of additional lifespan.\n\n\u201cOf course, if you\u2019re going to become rich overnight, I guess killing a god is a reasonable way to do so.\u201d Han Sen was delighted by this result. After all, he had just received a big boost to his lifespan and a great deal of lifeforce. His whole body was brimming with a scary presence.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t dare stay in Destiny\u2019s Tower a minute longer. He picked up Li Keer and resumed his flight down the stairs. This time, when he reached the first floor, he encountered the door that would lead him outside. There were no more stairs leading down, keeping him inside a loop.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Li Keer, who had been unconscious up to this point, slowly shook herself awake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really know. That geezer was a bit weird, wasn\u2019t he? After you punched him, you got blasted into a wall and you passed out. But the man was shattered into bits, and he became a pile of rubble,\u201d Han Sen said, lying to Li Keer with a straight face.\n\n\u201cHow could that happen?\u201d Li Keer looked at Han Sen with suspicion. She didn\u2019t believe his story, but she couldn\u2019t be certain from his thoughts whether he was lying or not. She went back into the tower, and at the top floor, she saw a pile of rubble just like Han Sen had described."
