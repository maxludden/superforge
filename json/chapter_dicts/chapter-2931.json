    "text": "Moon Shadow God could saw that her shadow blades weren\u2019t working, so she revealed herself from out of the darkness. She was floating behind the shadow blades. She looked at Han Sen madly and said, \u201cNo matter how strong you are, you must die because of what you did to my son.\u201d\n\nHan Sen coldly said, \u201cMoon Shadow God, I pity you. I do not want to kill you. You should just go.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo? Of course, I will not go. If I cannot kill you, you are not going to escape.\u201d Moon Shadow God said something that did not make any sense. Her shadow blades quickly blended into the dark and disappeared.\n\nHan Sen saw Moon Shadow God leave. He enabled the big goldfish to carry on leading the way. They did not travel for long when they saw a crack in the ground.\n\nIt was unknown how wide the crack was, but the stone lantern\u2019s light could not reveal the other side of it. There was only darkness.\n\nHan Sen looked deeper. It was just darkness. He did not know how deep the crack was.\n\nHan Sen did not want to fly in that place. The danger meter was too high, so he looked to his left. He then looked to his right and decided to walk along the left side of the crack. He wanted to see if he could go around it.\n\nHe walked 10 miles, and the crack next to him had still not ended. It looked like a bottomless abyss. He did not know how far it went.\n\n\u201cWeird. Why do I not see Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others?\u201d Han Sen frowned. Ancient Abyss Grandmaster had not arrived there too long before them. Yet, all this way, he had not seen Ancient Abyss Grandmaster or his friends. That was not right.\n\nWhile he was thinking. Han Sen\u2019s eyes froze. He saw a creature at the edge of the big crack.\n\nThe creature was dressed in black armor. It was like European, medieval heavy armor. The creature was sitting at the edge of the crack. It lowered its head and peered into the crack.\n\n\u201cMy name is Han Sen,\u201d Han Sen said while looking at the armored creature. \u201cI am just walking past here. I apologize if I am disturbing you. I hope you will not take offense.\u201d\n\nThe armored creature gave no response. It just continued to sit where it was with its head lowered.\n\n\u201cIs it dead?\u201d Han Sen used Dongxuan Aura to check the armored creature\u2019s presence. Who would have thought that when Dongxuan Aura touched down on the creature\u2019s armor, the black armor would suddenly shine? It displayed many light symbols across it. When the light symbols flickered, the area around was covered with the light symbol and a bai sema. Han Sen and the others were locked into that bai sema.\n\nThe armor\u2019s light symbol grew brighter. There was some air coming out of the armored creature. It looked like it was there, but it was not there. That air was so strong that it made Han Sen feel scared.\n\nHan Sen clutched the stone lantern and fell back. He threw a punch at the bai sema, but the power he unleashed was repelled by it. It almost resulted in Han Sen being thrown off the back of the big goldfish.\n\n\u201cThe death angel is activated. You are dead.\u201d Moon Shadow God was outside the bai sema. She looked at Han Sen with rage in her eyes.\n\n\u201cAre you saying the death angel was your work?\u201d Han Sen looked at Moon Shadow God.\n\n\u201cI would not dare touch the death angel,\u201d Moon Shadow God coldly said. \u201cIt was the work of Sacred Leader. It is a scary machine that guards the holy garden. I just played a trick to have you stumble into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA machine? It has such a big lifeforce. How can it be a machine? It is a living thing.\u201d Han Sen looked at the armored creature in shock. That mysterious armored creature was now called a death angel.\n\nThe lifeforce of the being was very strong. It did not look like a machine at all.\n\n\u201cYou do not know anything. Sacred Leader knows everything. You will never understand that. It is not just a living machine. If Sacred Leader wants to, he can turn a stone into a living thing.\u201d Moon Shadow God sounded angry. She went on to say, \u201cI just wish I could avenge the death of my son through my own hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you risk so much for that kind of son?\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\n\u201cNo matter how bad he was, he was my son. You killed him, so you have to pay.\u201d Moon Shadow God\u2019s expression looked a little conflicted as she tried to force a look of true decision.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something more, but he saw that the death angel\u2019s back was gleaming with light. Suddenly, giant, big light wings appeared.\n\nWhen the light wings spread, the death angel\u2019s body started to float. It was now facing Han Sen. The eye of the helmet had two light beams. They were like spotlights shining on Han Sen.\n\nThe light symbols on the armor made it look half transparent. With the light wings, it made the death angel look like an angel descending to Earth. That scary presence made people feel a chill. It was like if the death angel moved its light wings, space and darkness would instantly rip.\n\n\u201cWhoever comes to the holy garden\u2026 Die.\u201d The death angel sounded emotionless. It was like a cold and emotionless machine. While it was talking, the death angel rose its right arm above its head. Its arm was like a blade rising. The flames were like they were blowing into the sky. It was like a burning flame slashing a sky light sword, and it was coming down on Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis place does not look like the holy garden.\u201d Han Sen looked around. Aside from the big crack, all he saw were broken rocks. He did not see any buildings, and there was certainly no garden.\n\nEven though the garden was broken, he should have still been able to see the ruins of it. There was nothing of the sort anywhere to be seen.\n\nUpon hearing what Han Sen said, the death angel appeared to be shocked. It lowered its head and thought.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be a machine. It must be a creature.\u201d Han Sen did not think the death angel was a machine. No machine was able to think the way it did.\n\nMoon Shadow God coldly laughed as she said, \u201cYou are happy too soon. That big crack was supposed to be in the holy garden. Where you are standing is the entrance of the holy garden.\u201d\n\nOf course, the death angel only thought for a moment before saying, \u201cThis place is the holy garden. You entered the holy garden, so you should die.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the death angel\u2019s armor carried a strong flame. It was headed toward Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDad, let me do this.\u201d Han Sen wanted to move, but Bao\u2019er suddenly spoke. She jumped off of his back. She was in the air. Her sunglasses flashed. Bao\u2019er\u2019s body started to change. She suddenly looked just like the death angel. The armor on her was very bright, and the light wings were big and white.\n\nPang!\n\nBao\u2019er raised her arm too. She was learning death angel\u2019s position of attack. Two powers collided in mid-air, which created a big explosion. It blew open the death angel\u2019s bai sema. They actually tied, and neither of them was hurt.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible? Who is this girl? How was she able to turn into the death angel?\u201d Moon Shadow God looked at Bao\u2019er. She was in shock.\n\nHan Sen knew it was the power of the sunglasses, but the sunglasses could only morph a person into the shape of a creature. Once the creature was scanned, one could adopt the appearance of the creature. Then, one would also have the power of that creature.\n\nUnfortunately, the sunglass\u2019s scan speed was not fast. It required time, and the scanning changes required a lot of power and energy. It was not just limited by time. One was not able to change into anything one wanted to. There were a lot of limitations."
