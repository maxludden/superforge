She had left Space Garden to practice. She had yet to return. Han Sen wondered where she had gotten to. He certainly did not expect to run into her there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was on a xenogeneic island hunting xenogeneics and met a weird guy. He said I could be his inheritor, and he brought me here.\u201d Dragon Lady paused and went on to say, \u201cHe often brings me rare xenogeneic ingredients I can cook with. This place is not all that bad, so I have not been in a hurry to\n\n\u201cThose two xenogeneics keep referring to a certain lady. Might that be you?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide as he looked at Dragon Lady. He appeared to be surprised.\n\nThe Ancient Gods were always mysterious, and that was especially true of Ancient God King. If that Dragon Lady could inherit Ancient God King\u2019s stuff, perhaps she would be able to become very powerful in the universe and no one would dare provoke her.\n\n\u201cWhat lady? Are you insulting me?\u201d Dragon Lady frowned.\n\n\u201cNot that kind of lady\u2026\u201d Han Sen wanted to explain, but he suddenly heard a booming sound. The one-eyed xenogeneic and the eight-armed black bear xenogeneic came rushing in.\n\n\u201cKid, where are you going to run? Get ready to die!\u201d the eight-armed black bear weirdly shouted. Eight of his pores were shining. They created eight little suns that were lobbed at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cBig dumb bear, what are you doing?\u201d Dragon Lady shouted at the eight-armed black bear.\n\nThe eight-armed black bear heard Dragon Lady\u2019s voice. It made his entire body shake. He made his little suns even smaller. He wished to say something, but the one-eyed xenogeneic spoke first. \u201cMy Lady, this kid stole the ancient spirit seed. We are going to take it back. You should avoid this situation and allow me to reclaim the ancient spirit seed. We can talk all about this later.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the one-eyed xenogeneic and eight-armed black bear wanted to resume the attack on Han Sen. \u201cHow many times must I tell you guys to not call me lady?\u201d Dragon Lady coldly shouted. \u201cPlus, who is allowing you to capture people in my place? Furthermore, he is a friend of mind. If you guys touch one finger of his, I will turn you guys into barbecued pork.\u201d \u201cHe is\u2026 Little Master\u2019s\u2026 Is he your friend?\u201d The one-eyed xenogeneic and the eight-armed black bear were in shock.\n\n\u201cGet out of here before I cook you,\u201d Dragon Lady coldly said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that,\u201d the eight-armed black bear angrily said. \u201cHe still has the ancient spirit seed. If we don\u2019t take it back, the master will scold us.\u201d\n\nThe one-eyed xenogeneic quickly pulled the eight-armed black bear back, smiled, and said, \u201cYou should rest, Little Master. We will leave now.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the one-eyed xenogeneic pulled the eight-armed black bear away.\n\nThe eight-armed black bear looked unsatisfied as it asked, \u201cWhat are you pulling me away for? If we do not bring back the ancient spirit seed, and Master is angry, we are going to be done for.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d the one-eyed xenogeneic said. \u201cThe geno holy fluid is for the Master giving it to the lady. If the lady\u2019s commands were disobeyed, the Master would be even angrier. Then, our situation will be made even worse. If the lady has already told us what to do, then this incident is out of our hands. We should just go and tell Master.\u201d It hastened its departure.\n\nIn the garden, Dragon Lady checked Han Sen out and said, \u201cThat weird man poured blue blood all over you. Your body seems a little different.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see it too? Yes, I am a little different.\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cYour muscles appear leaner,\u201d Dragon Lady said while looking at Han Sen. \u201cThe fat ratio has been lowered. Meat like this is not suitable for cooking. You would do fine as a meatball.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s forehead developed a cold sweat. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like I am food.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Han Sen looked at the Dragon Lady and said, \u201cIt looks like you improved fast. You look like you have improved a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said, that weird guy gave me a lot of high-class xenogeneic ingredients, so I have a lot of high-class genes,\u201d Dragon Lady replied. \u201cI am butterfly class now. He says he is going to get me a geno holy fluid. He said that if I drink it, I can become a true god.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the Empty Dragon King in the wok has been cooked for you.\u201d Han Sen sounded jealous. \u201cWhat Empty Dragon King?\u201d Dragon Lady sounded surprised.\n\nHan Sen explained the whole thing. Dragon Lady sounded a bit angry. \u201cHow could they do this? They really shouldn\u2019t have. Such a cute little baby\u2026 How could they dare to cook it?\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded. The ancient spirit seed on his arm nodded too.\n\nDragon Lady said with seriousness. \u201cRight, for such a superior ingredient, how could it be cooked so randomly? They should have let me cook it instead.\u201d\n\nThe foreheads of Han Sen and the ancient spirit seed on his arm developed some black lines, especially the ancient spirit seed. It looked scared and tried hiding in Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\nHan Sen pointed at the ancient spirit seed and said, \u201cCough, cough. By the way, Dragon Lady, if there are not many effects and there is a replacement, can we not kill it for my sake?\u201d.\n\nThe thing really did look like a human baby. Han Sen did not want to see it become food.\n\n\u201cI am fine with that,\u201d Dragon Lady said while opening her arms. \u201cI just do not know if he will agree.\u201d\n\nplight.\u201d A voice echoed across the giant, underground garden. A God Spirit-looking character broke space and entered the garden.\n\nHan Sen felt a chill. He looked at the God Spirit-like person. In the shiny light, he saw a male body. Because of the rainbow light, he could not see exactly what he looked like.\n\n\u201cMy name is Han Sen. Are you Ancient God King?\u201d Although Han Sen did not feel the power of his opponent, with that atmosphere, he knew he should have been something big.\n\nAncient God King coldly asked, \u201cAre you Dragon Lady\u2019s friend? Call me Ancient Origin God.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you can let him live,\u201d Han San quickly asked. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I can let him go, but without it, Empty Dragon King cannot be cooked in a short period of time. It will delay the time needed to create the geno holy fluid. Unless\u2026\u201d Ancient Origin God did not keep talking. He\n\n\u201cYou can just tell me directly.\u201d Han Sen knew there was something else.\n\n\u201cUnless you can find a replacement. From what I have seen, you are not bad.\u201d Ancient Origin God looked at Han Sen as he spoke.\n\nWhen he said that, Han Sen\u2019s expression changed. He felt sorry for the ancient spirit seed but not enough to trade his life for it. He would not die for it.\n\nDragon Lady stopped before Han Sen. She looked at Ancient Origin God as she said, \u201cHe is my friend. You cannot lay a finger on him.\u201d"
