    "text": "For more than one hundred hours, Han Sen flew the white whale forward across an endless sea cloaked in mist. Still, he couldn\u2019t find an escape route.\n\nThe space powers within the creature\u2019s stomach were layered like a giant space maze. Through various space folds and faults, they couldn\u2019t find a way out.\n\nThe scariest thing was that the cracks in space could do serious damage to the hull of the white whale, leaving large scratches across it despite its incredible resilience.\n\nFortunately, Han Sen had his Dongxuan Area and the Purple-Eye Butterfly. He was able to avoid the space cracks. If he hadn\u2019t been able to, the white whale would have been torn apart, and they all would have died in short order.\n\nEven so, Han Sen still had to face the crisis that had literally swallowed them. The silver lining in all this, however, was the fact that the white whale was repairing itself more quickly than the corrosion was eating it away.\n\nStill, the ship\u2019s recovery processes cost material and energy. If the energy was depleted, then death was the only thing that awaited them. The ship and its crew were depressed. The uncertain fate left everyone feeling nervous. Aside from Bao\u2019er, who was trying her best to make Ning Yue happy, none of the others could raise a smile.\n\nHan Sen was under a lot of pressure to resolve this. He wasn\u2019t worried about his safety, as he could always hop back to the sanctuaries. But if he did that, Ning Yue and Fang Qing Yu would be left to die.\n\n\u201cBrother Fang, can you call the Treasure Identifier Elder? Can you see if he can help us?\u201d Han Sen asked Fang Qing Yu hopefully.\n\nFang Qing Yu pulled out his Wanjie Rubix Cube. The Rubix cube\u2019s squares were all grey and lifeless. It wasn\u2019t picking up any signals.\n\n\u201cI tried already. The Wanjie Rubix Cube can\u2019t function in this place. The Wanjie Rubix Cube is a space treasure, but the Black Hole Spider is also a space xenogeneic. Their powers affect each other.\u201d Fang Qing Yu smiled ruefully.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He continued to guide the white whale forward. There was nothing he could do right now, so he would just have to wait and see what happened next.\n\nThe pirates seemed to be in shock. If it wasn\u2019t for Han Sen, whose lofty power they held in the highest esteem, they would have already had complete mental breakdowns. Without him, God knew what they would have done.\n\nNing Yue didn\u2019t require pressure to break. If Bao\u2019er even teased her, that would get the waterworks flowing. She\u2019d sob like a madwoman.\n\nBut in the eyes of the pirates, she was something else entirely.\n\nThey had watched Ning Yue become a man and kill someone terrifying. Ning Yue might be a vulnerable person that they could push around right now, but no one dared to do it. They didn\u2019t want to incite that slumbering wrath.\n\nNo one spoke, but all of a sudden, Han Sen saw a black shadow in the mist. He couldn\u2019t see what it was, but it seemed to be something very large on the black sea.\n\nHan Sen frowned, but he drove the white whale toward it. Nothing could be worse than what they were currently going through. This might have been a worthwhile opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d When the white whale drew closer to the shadow, some of the other crew members finally noticed it.\n\n\u201cLand\u2026 there is land!\u201d When they were finally able to see what it was, they laughed in delighted relief.\n\nAn unbelievable scene appeared from the black sea. There was a large stretch of dark red land before them. Han Sen could see the crimson sea stacks and reefs surrounding it.\n\nEven from afar, Han Sen could see some weird plants decorating the place.\n\nThese plants were the normal trees or grass or vines that one might expect to find on an island. Instead, they were some mushrooms in many different shapes and sizes.\n\nThe big mushrooms were like Ferris Wheels. Others were the size of a room. A few were as small as beans. The place was colorful, and they all looked very lovely.\n\nPlus, many of the mushrooms glowed. They lit up the black mist and sea.\n\nHan Sen and the others looked at that mushroom land as if they were staring at a fairytale come to life. They looked very surprised.\n\n\u201cIf there is land, does that mean we aren\u2019t inside the stomach of the Black Hole Spider?\u201d Ning Yue looked at the mushroom land, and happiness returned to drive away her tears.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t quite as cheery, though. He had seen many xenogeneic bodies that featured landmasses and palaces. The Black Hole Spider was so huge, having a landmass inside it was not too surprising.\n\nNo matter what, if that land had plants, then it was suitable for life. Plus, the mist didn\u2019t seem to obscure the mushroom land. That would at least keep the white whale\u2019s hull from being further corroded. This was a good thing.\n\nAs he flew the white whale to the land of mushrooms, Han Sen wasn\u2019t in a hurry to land. First, he flew around the mushroom landmass. As he circled it, his eyebrows furrowed.\n\nThe land of mushrooms was very pretty, and the mushrooms covered it in rainbows and splashes of color. But aside from the mushrooms, there was nothing else around.\n\nThere weren\u2019t any xenogeneics, and there weren\u2019t any other types of plants. There were only mushrooms.\n\nFrom Han Sen\u2019s prior experiences, the prettier a mushroom was, the more poisonous it was. Those mushrooms were extraordinarily pretty, so he imagined they were also extremely deadly.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Fang Qing Yu asked, pointing at the forest of mushrooms.\n\nHan Sen looked to where he was pointing, and he saw that inside the mushroom forest was a stone mountain. The stone mountain was very circular, and it was shaped something like a bun.\n\nNext to the small mountain, a small ship was parked. It looked old and broken, so there was no way of knowing who it belonged to.\n\n\u201cCreatures are living here!\u201d the pirates said excitedly.\n\nHan Sen drove the white whale closer to the downed battleship. Before they got any nearer, though, a door opened and a creature climbed out.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw the creature, he felt his eyes open wide.\n\nHe had seen many strange people in his time, but that creature that had just come out of the ship looked odd, even to him. The creature was snow-white, and its body was two meters tall. It was like an angry tiger, but there was a little pink mushroom glowing on its head. It made the tiger\u2019s angry face look rather cute.\n\n\u201cWhat a cute little tiger!\u201d Ning Yue looked at the tiger and clutched her chest. Her eyes were full of stars.\n\nThe white tiger with the little pink mushroom on its head looked at the white whale in the sky. It opened its mouth, walked around, and then let loose a loud, \u201cMeow!\u201d\n\nHan Sen and the others all swapped glances. Ning Yue, in particular, looked as if she was melting. She looked at the white tiger through the white whale\u2019s screen and passionately said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cute!\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nBefore anyone could say anything more, the white tiger jumped, landing on the white whale\u2019s back. The white whale suddenly lurched. An enormous dent formed in the spine of the white whale, and it was pushed down into the canopy of mushrooms."
