Things went wrong upon going there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sunset shook her head.\n\n\u201cWhat? How can you not know? Have you not been to the sanctuaries?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes were wild with a desire to know. If she was truly a member, she would know what had happened, surely.\n\n\u201cThe sanctuaries? Is that the other dimension?\u201d Sunset asked, almost as if she was speaking to herself.\n\n\u201cHow can you not know about the sanctuaries? Upon first spawning in the First God\u2019s Sanctuary, you are given the basics and need-to-knows right away.\u201d Han Sen was starting to believe she was pulling his leg.\n\nSunset looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cFirst God\u2019s Sanctuary? The first? Were more discovered?\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Sunset in disbelief, finding it difficult to determine whether or not she was joking.\n\n\u201cJust tell me about this other dimension, this \u2018sanctuary,\u2019 as you put it. Explain to me as plainly and as concisely as you can,\u201d Sunset asked.\n\nHan Sen noticed her face was quite serious and that this was a genuine question. So, he spared no time in explaining to her what the sanctuaries were.\n\nHe told her how they had been constructed and what the creatures and spirits were like, having adapted to their presence. He explained what he could in a few minutes.\n\nWhen Sunset heard what he had to say, a strange look fell across her face. She then said, \u201cIf what you are saying is true, then this is not the place we found. The Seventh Team did not breach this sanctuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying you found another dimension, separate from the sanctuaries?\u201d Her words were challenging Han Sen\u2019s ability to believe her, and he was starting to think she was a liar.\n\nHumanity came to know about the existence of sanctuaries through the Seventh Team; they were the ones who discovered them. In the years that followed, humanity started to evolve at an alarming rate.\n\nSunset stroked her hair and said, \u201cWhere we went was not the sanctuary you have described. Or at least, it may have been a sanctuary\u2026 just not one that is known to you. When we breached this new dimension, we spawned someplace together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you spawn?\u201d Han Sen harbored many doubts about whatever she was going to tell him, but he still wanted to hear what she had to say.\n\nSunset wore a confused look, and she explained, \u201cWhere we went to, it was like God\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Kingdom?\u201d Han Sen again thought she was referring to the sanctuaries. The sanctuaries could, after all, be referred to as a place of miracles and could believably be described as God\u2019s Kingdom. Han Sen told her, \u201cYes, the sanctuaries are amazing. I wouldn\u2019t be against referring to them as God\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d\n\nSunset shook her head and explained, \u201cYou misunderstand me. I\u2019m talking about God\u2019s Kingdom. I\u2019m talking about the actual Kingdom of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, then what does God\u2019s Kingdom look like?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s curiosity had not lessened, despite the pinch of salt he was carrying.\n\n\u201cI cannot describe it,\u201d Sunset said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s convenient. Then just tell me about the environment there. What did you see?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIf I was able to describe this place and encapsulate it in mortal words, it wouldn\u2019t be a kingdom that belonged to God. The beauty of this place cannot be aptly put into words,\u201d Sunset told him.\n\n\u201cAll right. Well, what did you want to tell me earlier?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t really sure how to deal with this entire situation anymore.\n\n\u201cIf you find Han Jingzhi, you must kill him.\u201d Her words made Han Sen\u2019s blood run cold, and he was unable to lax the instant stiffening of his muscles.\n\nHan Sen recalled his encounter with Qin Huaizhen, and how he had been told to be wary of Han Jingzhi. He had died before he was able to learn more, but now he had met Sunset, who seemed to be on the same level. What she had just plainly told him was in-line with what he had previously learned, too.\n\nAs to why the Ning family said Han Jingzhi had saved their family, he did not know.\n\nAnd the Qin family as a whole respected him. If Han Jingzhi really was not the likable, respected person Han Sen had previously believed him to be, wouldn\u2019t Qin Huaizhen have warned his family?\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t wrap his head around what was going on, so he asked, \u201cWhy should I kill Han Jingzhi?\u201d\n\nSunset looked strange, as if she was not expecting this response. Her words in return were simple, but perplexing. She said, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in something, for sure. I\u2019m not an atheist, but I don\u2019t follow the teachings of any religion in a devout manner,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\nSunset then asked Han Sen, \u201cWould you believe me if I told you we saw the face of God?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, really? What does he look like? I haven\u2019t seen God before, so I\u2019m curious.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure if she should be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cAgain, if I could explain it, it would not be God.\u201d Sunset paused briefly, and then went on to say, \u201cBring this news to the rest of the Qin family; \u2018Qin Huaizhen must be told to kill Han Jingzhi.'\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI see that you possess what is left of Taia, so I can only assume you are from the Qin family. Are you?\u201d Sunset asked.\n\nHan Sen shook his head and said, \u201cNo. I was given Taia as a gift, more or less. But you should know my surname is Han and that my great-grandfather is Han Jingzhi.\u201d\n\nSunset looked at Han Sen in shock, and she exclaimed, \u201cWhat? But he didn\u2019t have an heir! Even if your great-grandfather is called Han Jingzhi, it has nothing to do with him. Them both having the same name is a coincidence, nothing more.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t he have had a bastard son?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Sunset said, with assurance.\n\n\u201cThen at least tell me why he must be killed.\u201d Han Sen felt as if the conversation was going around in circles.\n\n\u201cHe must die because he is blasphemous,\u201d Sunset said."
