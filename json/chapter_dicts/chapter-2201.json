    "text": "Stephen and Sonic Butterfly King kept talking as they completed their registration. Even Kings had to follow the rules of the Thousand Treasures.\n\nThe Thousand Treasures rarely had any conflict with those of other races, but their powers most certainly positioned them in the top ten races of the universe. Many suspected they could easily land a spot in the top five.\n\nStephen and Sonic Butterfly King readied themselves to leave, when suddenly a man and a woman entered the base. With them was a little girl. The two Kings frowned upon seeing them.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t noticed that the man was Han Sen, but they felt the presence of the Jade Drum that Huangfu Jing was carrying. They frowned at her sternly.\n\nSince they had to register their Drums, there was no point in trying to hide what they had found.\n\nAnd in regards to the Thousand Treasures, they wouldn\u2019t help a customer hide their Jade Drum, either. The Thousand Treasures wanted the universe to know every time someone found a Jade Drum on Planet Jade Drum. It would be very good for their business. So Han Sen and Huangfu Jing carried their Jade Drums openly.\n\nSince they were going to register their drums, they didn\u2019t have to hide their identities, either. Every Jade Drum claimed would be advertised. So, Han Sen took Huangfu Jing to register their findings right away.\n\nSonic Butterfly King and Stephen saw Han Sen and Huangfu Jing approach the registration booth. They kept staring at Huangfu Jing\u2019s bag. They could sense the Jade Drum inside, but they knew they couldn\u2019t be 100% certain that\u2019s what it was until they saw it.\n\nWhen Huangfu Jing took her Jade Drum out of her bag, the Kings sucked in a sharp breath of air.\n\n\u201cA Jade Drum\u2026 That\u2019s a Jade Drum!\u201d Those of the other races saw Huangfu Jing reveal a Jade Drum, and many of them couldn\u2019t keep themselves from shouting.\n\n\u201cIt has been a year since the last Jade Drum was found.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at her presence. She is a Marquise at the very most. I can\u2019t believe she was lucky enough to find one of those legendary Jade Drums.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! Is this good luck or bad? It will be difficult to determine. Things don\u2019t always go well for a Marquise who finds a Jade Drum.\u201d\n\nAll the Kings were talking quietly amongst themselves. The workers in the base were just as surprised to see the Jade Drum, as well. But they still registered it to her like it was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nDoing business with the Thousand Treasures was reliable. They had even sold deified treasures before. Nothing bad ever happened in one of their places of business. They wouldn\u2019t try anything underhanded to attempt to secure a Jade Drum.\n\nThey followed their procedures and protocol as was customary. Huangfu Jing handed in her access ticket, then struck her Jade Drum. After the registration was complete, the Jade Drum was confirmed to be an official possession of hers.\n\nStephen could not help himself from walking over to Huangfu Jing and asking, \u201cFriend, are you selling that Jade Drum of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t plan on selling it,\u201d Huangfu Jing said.\n\nShe was just an Earl. A Duke Jade Drum could be very beneficial to her, and it would be much safer for her to explore with it in tow. Killing xenogeneics would be much easier, as well. Huangfu Jing had no intention of selling it.\n\nOf course, that was also because no King planned on attacking her just yet.\n\nStephen frowned, but he wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily. He went on to say, \u201cDo not reject my request just yet. I am Stephen from the Naga. Give me your sum. Name any price. I won\u2019t try to haggle you for a bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Huangfu Jing did not move a muscle, save to give him her quick answer of no.\n\nStephen\u2019s face looked dire. So, Sonic Butterfly King came forward and said, \u201cKid, it won\u2019t be easy to look after a Jade Drum. I can trade you my Duke-class Eight Sonic Butterfly for it. And on top of that, I will keep you safe. What do you say to that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Huangfu Jing\u2019s answer was still the same cold response.\n\n\u201cIf you do not sell it right now, you will regret it the moment you set foot off of Planet Jade Drum. But by then, it will be too late. If you want to sell it, now is your chance.\u201d Sonic Butterfly King\u2019s face did not change during his speech. He smiled.\n\nHuangfu Jing ignored him and stepped away.\n\nSonic Butterfly King started to step closer to tell her something else, but Han Sen walked in front of him and said, \u201cMy friend told you she isn\u2019t interested in selling it. Please ask someone else.\u201d\n\nSonic Butterfly King\u2019s expression turned to stone. \u201cHow dare you interrupt my talk with her?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shrugged silently. He moved to the registry booth and revealed his own Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cAnother Jade Drum!\u201d Everyone in the base was shocked. No one could have expected that two Jade Drums would be found on the same day.\n\nSonic Butterfly King was flabbergasted. He did not expect Han Sen to have a white Jade Drum, as well.\n\nThe workers looked very surprised. They completed the registration for Han Sen, indicating it now officially belonged to him.\n\n\u201cAre you selling your Jade Drum? What I promised her will still apply to you, if you are willing to engage in such a transaction.\u201d Sonic Butterfly King looked right at Han Sen when he spoke.\n\nHan Sen ignored him, which prompted Stephen to follow up. He said, \u201cFriend, if you are selling the Jade Drum, I will pay a high price and keep you safe. You can name your price. Anything you wish.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, but I have made no plans to sell it,\u201d Han Sen answered, rejecting his offer.\n\nSonic Butterfly King looked gloomy, but before he said anything further, his eyes opened wide. He saw Han Sen bring out another Jade Drum.\n\nThis Jade Drum looked very strange. There were some red symbols across it, and it looked very different from the average Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 another Jade Drum\u2026 How is that possible?!\u201d\n\n\u201cD*mn! It looks like they are together. They found three Jade Drums. Did they find a special Jade Drum mine?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis luck is truly crazy. They have managed to obtain three Jade Drums.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat third Jade Drum looks wrong, though. It\u2019s different than a normal one. It cannot be a mutant one, can it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it is a mutant Jade Drum, then it will be worth a lot. We know that normal Jade Drums can become King class, but a mutant Jade Drum might go even higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is extremely lucky. It is too lucky. I\u2019m sure such luck will result in a disaster for them shortly. They look low-level, but they have each earned a Jade Drum. Oof. They are very dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not luck! That is pure danger.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nAs everyone discussed this, Stephen and Sonic Butterfly King stared at the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, seething with greed. They didn\u2019t even blink. The mutant Jade Drum was so exceptionally rare that it wasn\u2019t seen more than once every ten thousand years. They could have been items that were higher than King class. Even King class people treated them like treasures.\n\n\u201cI am sorry, sir. According to the rules of the Thousand Treasures, every creature can only take one Drum with them. You have already registered one\u2026\u201d the worker said to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI know. This Drum isn\u2019t mine. It belongs to my daughter.\u201d Han Sen pointed at Bao\u2019er, and then he passed her the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cThen, we will have to see her play it,\u201d the worker said, clearly not believing Han Sen. The worker looked back and forth between Bao\u2019er and the Jade Drum.\n\n\u201cDoes she have to hit the Drum here?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Those are the rules.\u201d The worker nodded with absolute certainty."
