    "text": "Katcha!\n\nThe green light flashed. Hell King\u2019s head was cut off.\n\nThe strange woman was stunned. She stared at the man who looked so skinny, clutching that green sword. All the other creatures around them were dead.\n\nThe woman squinted, trying to remember exactly what had happened when she came out of the black stone. She remembered that the skinny man had been in the stone factory when she emerged. He would have been the one she killed first.\n\nBut now that she thought about it, she didn\u2019t remember actually killing him; he had been too ordinary to keep her attention. She just tossed some red light his way and ignored him.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t dead?\u201d The strange woman looked at the man, who was smiling as he held the green sword. For some reason, when she saw his smile, the woman wanted to smile with him. It was like his smile was contagious.\n\nThe woman looked at Ning Yue and said, \u201cYou are not bad. If you ally with me, you can use my deified powers. Then, you can become defied as well. Unstoppable. You will become the greatest in the universe.\u201d\n\nNing Yue smiled and didn\u2019t answer. He walked slowly toward the woman.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d The woman looked intently at Ning Yue\u2019s face. She knew she should be wary, but she couldn\u2019t resist that infectious smile. She found herself treating him as a friend rather than a foe.\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Ning Yue said seriously.\n\nThe woman looked relieved. Somehow, what Ning Yue said felt incredibly trustworthy. His words seemed rock-steady, as if whatever he said had to be a universal truth.\n\nThe woman sighed, and just as she was about to respond, Ning Yue used the little green sword to lop her head off.\n\nThe woman\u2019s head rolled across the ground, with her red eyes still staring at Ning Yue as if she couldn\u2019t believe what he had just done.\n\nNing Yue sighed and said, \u201cI believe you can give me power, but I cannot beat the one I wish to with power alone. I need to take this step by step, my way, before I can stand before him.\u201d\n\nNing Yue wiped his little green sword. In his mind, he was still standing in that man\u2019s shadow. Determination flashed through Ning Yue\u2019s eyes. Then they became calm again. He walked up to the bodies of the strange woman and Hell King.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen maintained his claim on the primary root king dragon to absorb the king air. He stayed there for a whole month.\n\nThe blood kirin also absorbed a lot of king air, and over the month of training, he healed fully. Over the same period of time, Han Sen managed to get five hundred Duke genes.\n\nBut The Story of Genes could only open three gene locks before it stopped. As for the rest of the Duke genes Han Sen collected, he used them to open the gene locks of Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nJadeskin seemed to have the same limit of three gene locks.\n\n\u201cOpening the first gene lock grants an astral body. Opening the second gene lock provides a celestial body. Opening the third gene lock provides something above a celestial body. The third body feels different from a celestial body, but I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly what that difference is.\u201d Han Sen was amazed by the results of opening the third gene lock, even if he didn\u2019t fully understand what had happened.\n\nAs he trained, he also earned another reward. He managed to bring his Dongxuan Sutra up to the level of Duke. It had an element, but because he didn\u2019t have any more Duke genes, he couldn\u2019t open up any more gene locks.\n\nAfter The Story of Genes opened its third gene lock, it became difficult to absorb the power of the Kingese in his body. It was like the Kingese had fully merged with Han Sen\u2019s cells, and they could no longer be separated.\n\nHan Sen still wished to stay in King\u2019s Garden to absorb more king air, though. He wanted to open three gene locks for the Blood-Pulse Sutra and the Dongxuan Sutra. His hopes were soon dashed, however, because Bai Ling Shuang eventually showed up.\n\n\u201cBrother Sixteen, I\u2019m headed back to Night Charm Town,\u201d Bai Ling Shuang said in a friendly tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go there myself, but I haven\u2019t gotten an invitation.\u201d Han Sen then thought to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that she\u2019s randomly being nice. What does she want this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have Cher and the drinks ready. I will be the host tonight.\u201d Bai Ling Shuang gave him a lazy smile.\n\n\u201cIn that case\u2026 I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes were full of greed.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t actually want to go, of course. But since Bai Ling Shuang had extended such an explicit invitation, he didn\u2019t think he could turn her down. He would have to go eventually, so agreeing immediately would cast fewer doubts on his identity.\n\nBai Yi\u2019s ardent desire for Cher was well-known. If he didn\u2019t accept the invitation, that would be very strange.\n\nIn the most luxurious suite in Night Charm Town, Han Sen had draped himself over a sofa. He held Cher casually under one arm, and he swirled a glass of wine with his other hand. He looked at Bai Ling Shuang and said, \u201cSister Ten, tell me what it is you really want. You have been very generous with me this evening. Surely this isn\u2019t simply an opportunity for us to hang out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exams for the royal children are coming up soon. What are you planning to do about them, Brother Sixteen?\u201d Bai Ling Shuang asked with a smile.\n\nHan Sen had a sip of wine and squeezed Cher\u2019s butt with a smile. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019m just a first-tier King, and half-deified royal children will be competing. Even some deifieds will participate. What chance do I stand?\u201d\n\nBai Ling Shuang looked like she wanted to roll her eyes, but she still smiled and said, \u201cMaybe not. The exams are something Father has established so that our progress can be reviewed. We don\u2019t need to be number one. We just need to perform well to impress Father. If we do that, we can be rewarded.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing, Bai Ling Shuang said, \u201cI have witnessed your recent progress with my own eyes, Brother Sixteen. If you perform just as well in the exam, Father will notice. You will be heavily rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Han Sen said with an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nBai Ling Shuang looked at Han Sen for a while and said, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to get first place in the exams, I have a way in which we can make money. Are you interested in hearing more?\u201d\n\n\u201cI lack pretty much everything. I have a distinct lack of money, too. Please tell me, Sister Ten.\u201d Han Sen suddenly looked much more alert, and he considered Bai Ling Shuang with interest.\n\nShe smiled and said, \u201cYou know that in the exam, there is a task that sends you to Bone Mountain? Bone Mountain is obscenely dangerous for ordinary royal children. Aside from Brother Four and Sister Three, who are deified, any other royal child that goes there might fail. Even the crown prince. But Brother Sixteen, you are different. You have the Kingese protection. You can surely reach the peak of Bone Mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me what you\u2019re after?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cYou help me to get to the peak of Bone Mountain, and I will give you whatever you want.\u201d Bai Ling Shuang\u2019s smile had vanished, and she looked dead serious."
