Han Sen didn\u2019t extend an offer to the people of Nest Shelter to come along, as they were living a pleasant life where they were, already.\n\nWith everything prepared, Han Sen commanded Moment Queen to begin taking the shelter towards where the creature had been spotted.\n\nAlong the way, though, they stopped by two spots which possessed different types of sacred-blood scorpions. Han Sen was going to kill them along the way to see if he could get a beast soul he could combine with the gem.\n\nThe shelter could be moved only once a day, and after the third move, they arrived before a valley. There, they found many sacred-blood scorpions.\n\nHan Sen bid they remain there, and asked Old Huang to go and hunt them. Queen would accompany him.\n\nThe scorpions were green in color, and their size was comparable to that of a hound. They were called Sinister Scorpions. Their ranks were mostly comprised of primitive creatures, with a few mutant creatures among them. Moment Queen presumed the king of that enclave of creatures would be sacred-blood class.\n\nOld Huang killed a lot of primitive and mutant scorpions, as they could be eaten. That many scorpions would stock the shelter\u2019s pantries well.\n\nUnfortunately, they were unable to find the sacred-blood variant. So, Han Sen and Queen decided to look around. Doing so, they ventured towards a cave they thought the king might be residing in.\n\nQueen had been working hard ever since she had come to the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary and met Han Sen. All she needed now were sacred-blood and super geno points.\n\nNeedless to say, the beast souls Han Sen had given her had propelled incredibly quick growth.\n\nThe cave they ventured into was huge, and it was full of scorpions. But soon after, they noticed most of them were dead.\n\nHan Sen and Queen looked at each other. Old Huang was still fighting outside, so they were unsure why there were mounds of dead ones inside that cave they had not yet taken notice of.\n\nThey inspected the corpses of the scorpions and noticed they had been killed by weapons. If humans hadn\u2019t been out there, then it meant spirits had.\n\nThey followed the trail of bodies deeper into the cave. They ventured down a weaving, subterranean path for four kilometers, up until they came across a light glowing in the dark distance ahead of them.\n\nThere they saw four people having a barbecue. They were grilling the carcass of a scorpion that was around the same size as a car. Han Sen presumed it to be the slain sacred-blood scorpion he had been after.\n\nNeedless to say, he didn\u2019t expect to find humans there. When Han Sen approached them, they quickly drew their weapons, prompting him to say, \u201cWe are humans, too. We came here to slay the scorpions, but it seems you beat us to the punch. Who are you people?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you Han Sen?\u201d One of them recognized him, which prompted them all to put away their weapons.\n\n\u201cYes, I am Han Sen. What is your name?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nIt was difficult to tell the age of the barbecuing quartet, but if he had to guess, Han Sen would say they looked to be around thirty or forty years of age. The man that recognized Han Sen was a mountain of a man, and a spear was slung over his shoulders.\n\n\u201cMy name is Liu Yunhui; I work for Starry Group,\u201d the man introduced himself and the others in his company.\n\nThey were all keen to put their weapons away, as they had each heard a great deal about the person called Han Sen. A man called Wu Tian spoke, \u201cI thought you were disabled, and that your body had been badly injured.\u201d\n\nMany people knew about Han Sen\u2019s condition, but to this, Han Sen smiled and said, \u201cI am recovering. With my partner here to protect me, I do okay. Are there any human shelters around?\u201d\n\nWu Tian said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t. We live in a spirit shelter, the owner of which is surprisingly fair. He allows us to return to the Alliance whenever we wish.\u201d\n\nHan Sen asked them a few more questions, and he learned that the cave they were inside actually led to the spirit shelter they spoke of. There, they had encountered the scorpion king and killed it.\n\nThey told Han Sen he was at the precipice of an underground realm, and that it was massive; their shelter was only a small section of it. The realm could be a hostile place, as it was home to an abundance of wildlife.\n\nThe infamous super creature of the area was a rock rat king. It led an enclave of rats of varying ranks, and their numbers were in the millions.\n\nIndividually, they weren\u2019t a threat, but inciting the ire of its legion would lead to a terrifying counterattack.\n\nAside from the rock rat king and its army, green-scaled snakes were a common bother.\n\nThe underground world there had one large water source, with many rivers flowing into and out of it. All creatures would visit there, someday or another.\n\nAll the rivers connected to an underground lake.\n\nThe green-snakes inhabited that lake, mostly. A green-snake wouldn\u2019t attack someone who wanted water, unless it was mad.\n\nThey said they always saw the snakes there whenever they went to fetch water.\n\nAccording to what the spirit told them, there were a few other creatures that resided within that subterranean domain. And while they believed the spirit, they had yet to confirm the validity of the claim and encounter the creatures themselves.\n\nWu Tian also said there was a giant geno tree far below. It supported the entire structure of the underground kingdom. The spirit told them it was super geno plant. If it ever matured, it\u2019d provide geno treasure.\n\nNot too long ago, the tree exuded a pleasant smell to attract creatures there. It was a sign of the tree soon maturing.\n\nThe presence of all the creatures that were starting to visit the tree was what had compelled them to venture so far in a hunt."
