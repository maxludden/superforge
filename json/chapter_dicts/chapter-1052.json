Xie Qing King had said that he wanted to read some human books, and while Han Sen was happy to oblige, he didn\u2019t have any books he could give the spirit. After all, Han Sen could not risk leaking important human information.\n\nThe deal was still in place, too, in which Xie Qing King would help Han Sen eliminate Holy-Sword Emperor and conquer Holy-Sword Shelter. So, by giving Xie Qing King books as requested, Han Sen thought he\u2019d be in a better mood to assist.\n\nHan Sen tuned into a TV show discussing classic books and composed a list from that.\n\nThen, Han Sen purchased a number of the books, in physical format, and placed them in a box to give to Xie Qing King.\n\n\u201cA separation of race does not abolish the concept of friendship between them. We should treat those of a different species or race with a greater respect.\u201d When Han Sen was done on Skynet, he said this as he returned to the shelter.\n\nHe had only been gone a day, but when he got back, he discovered Xie Qing King had been impatient while he was gone. And through his inability to wait, he had gotten mad and almost destroyed the place.\n\nPeople had become scared of him by this point, and now, most people decided to remain in the Alliance until he was no longer around.\n\nOnly Bao\u2019er was unafraid of the big lug, and she frequently had fun riding around on his head.\n\n\u201cWhat are these things?\u201d Xie Qing King asked with wide eyes, upon seeing the boxes.\n\n\u201cYou will see, soon enough.\u201d Han Sen gave him a smile, but then went on to ask, \u201cBy the way, how do you feel about books? I could bring you some, but I am unsure whether or not you would be able to read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe human language is simple. Compared to the language of spirits, it is d*mn near babyish.\u201d Xie Qing King sounded passive aggressive, but he returned a smile, all the same.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good! I brought you some books, many containing illustrations. Perhaps you can learn more about humanity through them. Humans make excellent storytellers.\u201d Han Sen pushed the box to Xie Qing King and said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s in the box; loads of such books. I can bring you others if you don\u2019t like them, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Xie Qing King was appreciative, and he did like Han Sen quite a bit.\n\n\u201cI am also going to prepare some human food for you. And I\u2019ve actually brought a variety of snacks with me for you try, as well. Snacks are a staple of our culture!\u201d Han Sen then presented a number of snacks and laid them out for Xie Qing King.\n\nXie Qing King thought there was much to like about the human race, and they were composed of good people. Or at least, even if the others seemed weak, Han Sen was decent.\n\nHan Sen had also requested the delivery of a sofa so Xie Qing King could be more comfortable. And while the spirit relaxed, Han Sen got to cooking up a storm. Compared to spirits, he was a master chef. His cooking skills were near-enough divine.\n\nOf course, the primary reason for spirits\u2019 lack of interest in food was the fact that they did not have to eat. All they ever ate were fruits that proved beneficial to their development.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cook. I don\u2019t eat. Just bring me more books,\u201d Xie Qing King said, after finishing all the books that he had just been given.\n\n\u201cBut I have to cook you something. Fine dining is a cornerstone of human tradition. Cooking for others, or relishing the cooking of others, is incredibly important. So, you must try the food I am preparing,\u201d Han Sen explained.\n\n\u201cHmm, all right then.\u201d After agreeing, Xie Qing King watched Bao\u2019er open a bag of chips. Curious, he did the same.\n\nAs Han Sen continued to cook, Xie Qing King developed a fondness for the chips he had just consumed.\n\nA door to a new world had opened before Xie Qing King.\n\nHan Sen, in the meantime, occupied his mind with a plan of attack for how he\u2019d deal with Holy-Sword Shelter. For as long as that place remained active and controlled by Holy-Sword Emperor, he would not feel safe.\n\nSuddenly, Ji Yanran called Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d Han Sen asked her.\n\nAnd to this, Ji Yanran said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can. Not for a long while, leastways. Our discussions with the shura are still ongoing, and we\u2019ve just been talking about investigating a bunch of new crystallizer ruins that have been discovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re co-operating with the shura?\u201d Han Sen was quite shocked to hear this. The truce was still active, but he had thought that the tensions were still quite high. He never would have thought that relations with the shura would have advanced enough to allow a joint archaeology project with them.\n\nBut Ji Yanran explained, \u201cIn some places, the aid of the shura is imperative. We need them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are only just an evolver; why are you leading?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cThey picked me.\u201d Ji Yanran smiled and then went on to say, \u201cTo them, I\u2019m pretty much a princess. They sent a royal shura prince to escort me, so it\u2019s not as if I could have declined their request.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a royal shura with you?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s face became dour.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Human surpassers are also coming with me,\u201d Ji Yanran said, to alleviate his concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Han Sen swiftly said.\n\nBut Ji Yanran responded, \u201cThe people going with me have opened eight of their gene locks. And that aside, only sixteen people can go. There\u2019ll be eight humans and eight shuras.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d\n\nJi Yanran wished to continue their talk, but Han Sen hung up. He then went to contact Ji Ruozhen.\n\n\u201cWhy are you letting your daughter go to a place so dangerous?!\u201d Han Sen said, his voice clearly upset.\n\n\u201cThis is an important matter of the Alliance, and it is a privilege for my daughter to do this,\u201d Ji Ruozhen explained.\n\n\u201cShe is my wife, too, remember? Shouldn\u2019t I have a say in this?\u201d Han Sen did not wait for a response, and immediately went on to say, \u201cIf you want her to go so badly, I\u2019m going with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cEight people is the max. I\u2019m sorry, but we already have the best available people going,\u201d Ji Ruozhen said with a frown.\n\n\u201cYou can either let me go, or I take her away from there.\u201d Han Sen was firm in his stance on the matter."
