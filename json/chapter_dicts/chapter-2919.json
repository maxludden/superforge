    "text": "The way the big goldfish talked about how to get the treasure also seemed strange. Han Sen wondered if the big goldfish was trying to trick them.\n\nAfter considering the big goldfish\u2019s intelligence, the chance that it could make up a complicated story to fool someone was minimal. In the end, Han Sen decided to go and do what the big goldfish said.\n\nHan Sen did not let go of the small goldfish. He still took the small goldfish as a hostage and made the big goldfish lead the way.\n\nIn that endless sea of trash, Han Sen and Bao\u2019er were hidden in an old, space cabinet. They had been looking around their environment.\n\nHan Sen regretted believing the big goldfish. It said he would only have to hide amidst the trash and follow the current of the sea of trash to reach the treasure\u2019s location.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er had not been in the broken space cabinet for long when they saw the sky flash with some purple light substances. They reduced the size of the trash.\n\nHan Sen watched all the purple light substances flicker as they decomposed metal, stone, and plastic. He was afraid he and Bao\u2019er would end up decomposed with the cabinet.\n\n\u201cI hope the big goldfish did not lie to me. Otherwise, I will go back and cook his entire family. I will put in some extra chili when I cook them.\u201d After Han Sen pulled the string of the bow, there was no turning back. Although he was furious, he had no choice but to trust that big goldfish.\n\nHe was holding a fire-looking red scale that the big goldfish had given it to him. He was told to hold it to go through the magnetic stream safely.\n\nThere were more purple light substances. They were like a bunch of fireflies flickering in the sky. They made their way onto other substances. When those had enough purple light substances on them, they decomposed and fell apart.\n\nThe broken cabinet had quite a lot of purple light substances on it. Han Sen hesitated and wondered if he should use some form of defense.\n\nThe big goldfish had said that he should not make use of powers and reveal himself. Otherwise, the xenogeneic that guarded the treasure would find him. If that happened, he would have no chance of obtaining the treasure.\n\nIf the big goldfish was lying to Han Sen, and he did not use defensive powers now, only God knew what would happen if the purple light substance touched them.\n\nWhile Han Sen hesitated, a red light formed on the red scales in his hands. The red light was in the space cabinet, creating a layer of red.\n\nPerhaps it was because of the red layer\u2019s protection, but the space cabinet did not decompose like the other space trash even though the space cabinet was filled with purple light substances.\n\nSeeing the big goldfish scale working, Han Sen felt much safer. The father and daughter hid in the space cabinet. While the magnetic light stream kept floating, they saw more space trash being decomposed.\n\nThere was a small mountain-looking stone palace under the purple light substances. It broke and created numerous big rocks. When the big rocks had a huge amount of purple light substances on them, they became even smaller rocks. The process happened again and again. Everything was becoming decomposed. Finally, the small mountain-looking stone palace decomposed into the big barren system\u2019s white dust that was everywhere.\n\nThis process only lasted four or five days, yet a big palace had been reduced to dust.\n\nIn the time they were floating, Han Sen and Bao\u2019er had seen too much of this scene. Han Sen felt numb to it. Fortunately, the scale kept releasing its weak, red light. It protected the space cabinet and stopped the space cabinet from being decomposed.\n\nIn the beginning, there were not many purple light substances. Now, the purple light substances had created a sea of purple light. Aside from purple, there was nothing else.\n\nIn the space cabinet, a purple light kept rolling by. Fortunately, Han Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Aura was very good at space and universe location. Otherwise, they would not have known which direction they were headed.\n\nBao\u2019er looked out the window of the space cabinet and asked with shock, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave we arrived?\u201d Han Sen moved closer to the window. He saw the purple light stream was like an ocean. It was not where the big goldfish had told them to go.\n\nAccording to the big goldfish, when the purple light stream disappeared, then they would have arrived.\n\nIt was still purple outside. Han Sen was not able to see more than nine feet away. This could not have been the place yet.\n\nIn the purple light stream, Han Sen saw a blurry shadow. It was like some purple light was going up and down.\n\nThe thing was a bit far away. Although Han Sen was barely able to see it, he was shocked.\n\nThe father and daughter had been floating for almost 15 days. Everything they had seen was decomposed by the purple light stream. During the past few days, the purple light stream had become extremely thick. There was no more trash. Aside from the space cabinet, everything that entered the purple light stream had decomposed into the white dust.\n\nNow, that thing outside was like the space cabinet and had not been decomposed. It was going up and down in the purple light stream. It followed Han Sen in the purple light stream.\n\n\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Han Sen and Bao\u2019er were in front of the window. They kept watching the thing outside. They wished it was closer to the space cabinet so that they could see what it was.\n\nIt seemed as if their prayers reached the God Spirits. For a while, the purple light stream waved. The thing was getting closer to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCloser. Closer. I can almost see it now\u2026\u201d Han Sen was excited. After all, they had been inside the space cabinet for many days and were bored. They needed something interesting to do.\n\nBao\u2019er was also excited. She looked at the window and asked, \u201cDad, do you think that is a truck that sells ice cream?\u201d\n\n\u201cSelling ice cream in this place\u2026 You are quite imaginative\u2026\u201d Han Sen wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. He knew Bao\u2019er had been trapped there for many days and had not eaten much food. She wanted to eat good food.\n\nSuddenly, that thing was nearly right in front of them. It was only six feet away. Han Sen inspected the part that was closest to them.\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t\u2026 It is a dead body\u2026\u201d Han Sen clearly saw the body. It looked like a man who was sitting cross-legged. His clothes were still whole, but his face and hands were skeletal. There was no flesh.\n\nIn that very bright, purple light stream, the skeleton looked like jade. Its eyes were purple. The scene was quite bizarre.\n\n\u201cHis body and bones did not get decomposed. It does not look normal.\u201d Han Sen was used to dead people, so he was not afraid. He was more focused on the dead body\u2019s clothes."
