    "text": "But the mushrooms they did break, releasing a rainbow-colored mist. When Han Sen and the others looked closer, they could see a nearly infinite abundance of rainbow-colored spores forming the foggy veil.\n\nThe little red bird was angered. It flew straight out of the white whale\u2019s mouth and flared into its fire phoenix form. Its scary phoenix fire immediately turned the area into a burning hellscape. Many of the mushroom spores were burned to ash, and the white tiger that had assaulted them was surrounded in flames.\n\nThe white tiger jumped to escape the blazing inferno. It hovered in the air, opened its mouth, and fired cannonballs at the red phoenix.\n\nAs the cannonballs approached, Han Sen could see that they were actually mushrooms. The red phoenix opened its mouth and released another torrent of fire, which easily incinerated the incoming mushrooms. They combusted and exploded, and streams of spores erupted from them like fountains.\n\nThe explosions were beautiful, but within a second, the phoenix had reduced the mushrooms and their spores to dust.\n\nThe white tiger fired out many more mushrooms. Each of them was turned to ash by the little red bird. The white tiger started to look afraid of the little red bird\u2019s fire, and it started to believe it had incurred some fairly bad luck. The little red bird gave chase to the now-fleeing felon.\n\n\u201cBird Brother, go get him! Bird Brother is strong.\u201d The pirates could see that the little red bird had gained an advantage. They were so happy for the little red bird, they all cheered loudly and gave the bird their support.\n\nSome of the white tiger\u2019s fur was singed by the little red bird\u2019s fire. It kept meowing pitifully as it fled. Its white fur started to turn black in the heat, and it suddenly lowered its head toward the ground. Like a drill, it dug into the ground and disappeared someplace below.\n\nThe little red bird flew around the area, but it was unable to see the white tiger anymore. So, it flew back in a much happier mood.\n\nThe pirates quickly opened the door and welcomed the little red bird back inside.\n\n\u201cBrother Bird is so powerful\u2026 Brother Bird is like the best bird ever. That crappy tiger p*ssed itself when Brother Bird went out to greet it.\u201d The pirates said, trying to ingratiate themselves with the little bird.\n\nThe little red bird puffed up its chest to look big and cocky, like the big brother it was being revered as. It seemed as if the praise of the pirates had gone to the creature\u2019s head.\n\nUpon seeing it, Han Sen shook his head. \u201cEven a bird can\u2019t ignore sweet talk. The little red bird was once an innocent little thing, but now it has fallen.\u201d\n\nThe little red bird had been a nightmare for the white tiger. The crew needed the bird\u2019s protection, so no one dared to offend him. But when the bird flew back to Bao\u2019er, it made sure to look polite. It didn\u2019t dare to act cocky around her.\n\nHan Sen looked around. Aside from the white tiger, there were no other xenogeneics in the vicinity. The white tiger had been suppressed by the little red bird. So, for the time being, they were safe there.\n\nIf the white tiger had survived on the island, then they should be able to survive there as well. They would figure out how to escape later.\n\nFang Qing Yu and Ning Yue felt relieved. This place was strange, but it was better than the black sea. At least they weren\u2019t in any immediate risk of death.\n\n\u201cI wonder if those mushrooms can be eaten. They do look delicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe better looking they are, the more poisonous they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we are high-class pirates. Why would we be afraid of poison?\u201d\n\nThe pirates talked amongst themselves, but suddenly, one of them screamed. He sounded so scared, and he said, \u201cMush\u2026 mushroom\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is so shocking about mushrooms? They are everywhere.\u201d Another pirate laughed, but everyone still looked at the pirate that had just screamed.\n\nThat pirate looked very shocked. His fingers shook as he pointed, and in a trembling voice, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s a mushroom on your head.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose leg are you trying to pull here? Why would my head have a mushroom on it?\u201d The pirate didn\u2019t believe the claim. But when he touched his head to be sure, his face changed.\n\nHan Sen and the others all looked at the pirate. His head had a mushroom. It was a white mushroom that looked like an egg.\n\n\u201cMy\u2026 my head\u2026 has a mushroom\u2026\u201d That pirate touched his mushroom and screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of? Maybe Brother Bird accidentally dropped it onto your head,\u201d the ex-captain pirate shouted at the distressed pirate. He reached his hand out to pull and tug at the pirate\u2019s mushroom.\n\n\u201cAah! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!\u201d the pirate screamed in pain. The other pirate pulled harder at the mushroom, lifting the man\u2019s entire body, but the mushroom didn\u2019t come off.\n\nThe white mushroom on his head seemed to be attached to his scalp.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He looked at everyone\u2019s head, and he was given a fright.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 your head has a mushroom, too\u2026 and you, as well\u2026 argh!\u201d Everyone\u2019s head now had their own mushroom. The sizes and colors of each were all different.\n\nSuddenly, aside from Bao\u2019er and the little red bird, everyone\u2019s head had a mushroom.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Area to look at the mushroom on his head. It was the size of a fist, and it was pitch-black. It was like a little umbrella. The mushroom cap was quite large, but the stalk was very thin.\n\nThe scariest thing about it was that the roots of the mushroom were inside his head. They were like vines, tangling around his brain.\n\nHan Sen looked at Ning Yue and Fang Qing Yu. They both looked the same.\n\nNing Yue\u2019s head had a fat, pink-and-white capped mushroom. Fang Qing Yu\u2019s head had a rainbow polka-dot mushroom. The pirates all had different mushrooms, too.\n\nBut when Han Sen looked at them all with his Dongxuan Area, the mushrooms were attached to all of their brains.\n\n\u201cArgh! What the hell are these mushrooms?\u201d A pirate tried cutting off his mushroom with a knife. He barely managed to pierce the skin of the mushroom, and even that was so painful that it had him rolling around on the floor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a Mushroom Man!\u201d Ning Yue looked into a mirror. Seeing she had a mushroom, she couldn\u2019t help but weep.\n\nBao\u2019er tried to bring her comfort by saying, \u201cLittle Miss Ning Yue, your mushroom looks quite nice. You could join a mushroom beauty contest for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a Mushroom Man! I don\u2019t want to join mushroom competitions!\u201d Ning Yue cried.\n\nHan Sen tried to pull his mushroom, and when he did, his expression changed. When the mushroom was moved, it was like he was tugging his brain. His will was strong, but it still felt incredibly painful. He almost screamed and his face turned all pale.\n\n\u201cBrother Fang, do you know what this is?\u201d Han Sen asked Fang Qing Yu.\n\nFang Qing Yu\u2019s face turned white. He tried pulling his own mushroom, but he looked bitter. He shook his head and said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what this is. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. There are many xenogeneic parasite mushrooms in this world, but their spores are always breathed into the lungs to enact their parasitic mischief. I\u2019ve never heard of mushrooms attaching themselves to people\u2019s heads.\u201d"
