    "text": "The universe was dead silent. All of the creatures were watching Dollar stroke Golden Growler\u2019s head. They could not believe it was the same Golden Growler who had scared off Very High Leader. \u201cLittle Mountain\u2026 Little Mountain Leader\u2026 What is it doing?\u201d The green-haired beast\u2019s jaw nearly dropped to the floor. After he realized what was going on, he madly stomped his feet and screamed, \u201cHow dare he touch Little Mountain Leader\u2019s head! I am going to destroy his dirty fingers.\u201d\n\nThe woman nearby had only just realized what was going on. She looked at the green-haired beast seriously and said, \u201cWhen you brought Little Mountain Leader back, it already had a lower-race companion. Was that low-race person Dollar?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was a crystallizer. He was of a different race to this xenogeneic. There is no way it was this guy who could level up so quickly. But\u2026\u201d The green-haired beast hesitated.\n\n\u201cBut what?\u201d the woman asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cThat crystallizer is now quite famous in the universe,\u201d the green-haired beast said. \u201cIt was Han Sen, who is in Space Garden now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Sen?\u201d the woman asked with shock. After a deep thought, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d\n\nRight now, the universe was all messed up. The two of them were not able to speak anymore. They had not expected things to take such a drastic turn.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? Why does Golden Growler look like Dollar\u2019s pet?\u201d\n\n\u201cDollar\u2026 Golden Growler\u2026 They must have some sort of connection. I should have thought about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way! The geno god list\u2019s No. 1 is Dollar\u2019s pet?\u201d\n\nIt was not just ordinary creatures feeling this way. Even the old antiques, who had hidden away in the dark, and the higher races all had strange expressions.\n\nThe woman in Sky Palace was also shocked. \u201cWho is this Dollar? Empty Mountain\u2019s Golden Growler is treating him like this\u2026 The Growlers were always very cruel and cold. They never got close to outsiders.\u201d\n\nSky Palace Leader thought, \u201cDollar is very special. He has a god personality armament, law power, and a relationship with Golden Growler. I wonder what faction created such a person.\u201d\n\nIn the Extreme King garden, God watched Han Sen and Golden Growler with great interest. \u201cI did not expect you to be this interesting. You have surpassed my expectations. This was certainly not a wasted trip.\u201d\n\nGolden Growler\u2019s claws came off of Han Sen\u2019s shoulders. It opened its mouth and spat something into Han Sen\u2019s hands.\n\nHan Sen picked it up and had a look. It was a crystal body that had been generated by thunder. It looked like countless lightning bolts were broiling around inside it. It was like a mini thunder universe.\n\n\u201cIs this Ancient Thunder God\u2019s Ancient God Origin?\u201d Han Sen recognized what he had been given. He already had Ancient Water God\u2019s origin. It looked very similar. It was just this new one was a thunder element whereas the other one was water-based.\n\n\u201cRoar!\u201d Little Gold Gold growled at Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen and Little Gold Gold had a special connection similar to Little Angel. They were Han Sen\u2019s beast souls. Their bodies had been rebuilt to become genuine lifeforms that existed independently. Yet, they still had a connection to Han Sen, who could understand their thoughts. Little Gold Gold had recognized Han Sen because of that connection.\n\nLittle Gold Gold was saying he wanted to give Han Sen the Ancient Thunder God Origin so he could pass it on to Little Silver. He said it would help Little Silver a lot.\n\n\u201cSo, this was not for me, after all?\u201d Han Sen felt a little touched. He had not expected Golden Growler to remember Little Silver. He reached out his hand and stroked its head.\n\nIn the eyes of others, this scene had them seeing Golden Growler merrily swinging its tail like a hunting dog having captured prey to give to its master.\n\n\u201cOh my God\u2026 Dollar can\u2019t actually be Golden Growler\u2019s master, can he?\u201d \u201cIf things are really like that, then that is too scary. A pet has suppressed the whole universe and claimed the No. 1 spot on the geno god list.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really does seem like things are that way.\u201d\n\nEmpty Mountain\u2019s green-haired beast was as mad as a lunatic. He kept stomping around. He wanted to kill Dollar and 180 of his generations.\n\n\u201cYou should go now. I will look for you in Empty Mountain.\u201d Han Sen patted Golden Growler on the head and allowed it to exit the space battleground. In that way, Golden Growler was able to keep first place.\n\nGolden Growler shook its head and growled. Han Sen knew what he meant. Golden Growler was going to give first place to Han Sen. Han Sen was going to reject it, but Golden Growler growled at him and lowered its body. It wanted Han Sen to ride him.\n\n\u201cDollar! How dare you!\u201d The green-haired beast yelled. It was like a volcano eruption. He slapped the floor, making Empty Mountain shake. Every other creature reacted by falling to the ground in fear.\n\nEverybody was watching Han Sen ride Golden Growler\u2019s back. Suddenly, Golden Growler ripped space and exited the geno god list. \u201cWhat is going on? Why did they leave the space battleground together? Who lost?\u201d All of the audience was in shock. They had no idea what was going on.\n\n\u201cQuick, look at the geno god list. Dollar is on top. It looks like Dollar won. No\u2026 Dollar won\u2026\u201d People started talking nonsense. Everybody turned to look at the geno god list. The geno god list\u2019s top place was now showing Dollar instead of Golden Growler, which had taken Han Sen\u2019s previous position of No. 25.\n\n\u201cDollar\u2026 He is awesome. He let his pet get first place so he could be given it back\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have what it takes, you can have a Golden Growler for a pet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think only Dollar has what it takes to do that. In the universe, there is no other Golden Growler.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone was talking, Golden Growler took Han Sen out of the geno god list. They did not teleport back to where they were. They were nearby in space floating next to the geno god list.\n\n\u201cy.\n\nEveryone was wondering why Golden Growler and Han Sen had not teleported away. Suddenly, Golden Growler roared to the sky. Its body had a golden light that was like a flood. It went into the sky to tear up space. Under Golden Growler\u2019s power, space had a crack. An old, godly temple appeared. It was the geno hall. \u201cWhat is going on? I do not think the geno god list fights are over yet. Are they giving out the prizes already?\u201d \u201cPrize your ass. Did you not see Golden Growler rip space and summon the geno hall? They are going to the geno hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t! They are going to the geno hall? Can he do that? Ancient Water God failed not too long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gave Dollar first place. It gave up the chance to become a God Spirit. The only chance to become a God Spirit is to enter the geno hall. That is expected.\u201d\n\nWhen the geno hall descended, the whole universe felt like it went dim. Only the geno hall was shining with holy light. It was slowly coming out from space."
