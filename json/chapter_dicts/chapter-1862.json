    "text": "There was no use in watching the livestream now, because the moonlight was like a curtain that obscured everything that lay beyond.\n\nHan Sen stood inside the palace. He could feel the moonlight going into his skin. His bones and cells felt alive, as if they were being thoroughly cleansed by blessed water.\n\n\u201cWeird. The power of that moonlight\u2026\u201d As Han Sen wondered about all this, his Jadeskin started running.\n\nThe beams of moonlight drifted toward Han Sen and landed on him, as if he were their exact target.\n\n\u201cAh! They are the same element. That is why I felt that it was similar to Jadeskin.\u201d Han Sen was very happy about this. When the moonlight came through him, his Jadeskin developed even faster.\n\nWhen the Jadeskin had become xenogeneic, it looked as if it had gone as far as it could possibly go. But now that he had the benefit of the moonlight, it felt like it was going even further. This made Han Sen incredibly happy.\n\nWhen Han Sen absorbed that moonlight, the light wasn\u2019t reduced. In fact, the luminosity only increased. Within the moonlight, Han Sen was also able to see some sort of text that stood out brighter than the rest of the moon\u2019s light.\n\nWhen Han Sen read it, he noticed that it was a geno art.\n\nBut it did not have a title. So, Han Sen kept reading it, until he realized that it was something quite similar to Jadeskin.\n\nIt had not been created by the same entity, but the thought process behind it was surprisingly similar.\n\nThat geno art inside the moonlight was more suitable for the geno universe. Jadeskin was tuned for the sanctuaries it originated from, after all. It was impossible to tell which of the two was flat-out better, and that was because the environment was different.\n\n\u201cI am so lucky. I was thinking about how I could modify Jadeskin, and now I have this. Although I cannot copy it directly, it will be perfect if I can find a way to integrate it with Jadeskin for now.\u201d Han Sen was so happy, and he did his best to memorize the content of the text he could see above.\n\nThere was more and more moonlight entering him, and it almost started to feel like water. It was like a liquid, thickly flowing into Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body was like jade now. He stood within the glow of the moonlight like an ice statue, letting the moonlight penetrate him. His delicate bones were cleansed by the moonlight, making him as squeaky clean as any statue.\n\nMore and more moonlight bathed his body, until his xenogeneic genes started to evolve.\n\n\u201cAm I going to become a Viscount now?\u201d Han Sen was super happy with the prospect of this. Although it was the xenogeneic gene of Jadeskin that was evolving, it was still good enough for him.\n\nRecently, Han Sen had been wondering about how he might make himself a Viscount. And now it seemed that Jadeskin would be the trigger.\n\nHan Sen cast Jadeskin to absorb as much of the light as was possible. He had to make sure that his body received as much as it could. His other body parts were bathed in the moonlight, but what benefitted him most was the xenogeneic body.\n\nHis jade-looking body began to glow with a halo. It was a sign that he would soon become a Viscount. After becoming a Viscount, Han Sen could unleash his xenogeneic powers through smoke, fire, and light.\n\nJadeskin\u2019s power could very well be a light-element one.\n\nOutside of the Moon Palace, moons were rising. Every time a moon rose, the Moon Palace would become brighter.\n\n\u201cI wonder how many moons he will be able to raise?\u201d Yisha was looking at the palace with a fond smile.\n\nShe did not expect that Han Sen would be able to raise many, as he was essentially just there to practice. He was only a Baron, and he only had knife powers. She didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d manage to do too well.\n\nWith the Moon God power, it was very good for an outsider to be able to raise twelve moons. The most a Rebate had ever raised was thirty-six.\n\nHan Sen was not a Rebate, so Yisha would be happy to see him raise ten moons.\n\n\u201cYou can fight to get a higher rank, but not more moons. Twelve moons should be the max an outsider can achieve. Over the past few hundred years, only four or five outsiders have ever been able to raise twelve. The best managed to raise twenty-four,\u201d Icebird Duke said.\n\nThe Nobles and civilians were watching the moonrise keenly. They kept counting, each time a new one rose.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\nThe moons kept rising, and there were now ten of them above the palace. People were shocked.\n\n\u201cHe managed to get ten moons! Han Sen is lucky,\u201d Night River King commented calmly. He was currently playing chess with Black-Moon King.\n\nBlack-Moon King smiled and said, \u201cI think he can do more than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he can raise twelve?\u201d Night River King said, after moving one of his pieces.\n\n\u201cMore than that, even.\u201d Black-Moon King\u2019s smile did not go anywhere.\n\nNight River King was shocked by the assumption, and so he asked Black Moon King, \u201cYou think he can manage to raise more than twelve moons?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Black-Moon King said.\n\n\u201cIn the past few hundred years, only five outsiders have managed to raise twelve. And there are tens of thousands of competitors this year,\u201d Night River King said.\n\n\u201cKnife Queen selected the boy as her student. She had a reason for making that choice. It wouldn\u2019t be all that surprising,\u201d Black-Moon King said.\n\n\u201cHow about we make a wager? If Han Sen can exceed twelve moons, I will give you my Dragon Steel. If he is unable to, you give me the Steel Knife. Black Steel managed to get that Dragon Back Knife, so you don\u2019t need the Steel Knife.\u201d Night River King smiled.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Black-Moon King simply agreed, and then put a black chess piece down on the table.\n\nEleven moons had managed to rise. The next would be the twelfth. To many of the Rebate, that would be the max he was expected to achieve."
