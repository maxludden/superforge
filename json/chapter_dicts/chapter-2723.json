He had also lost a true god item\u2014the Star Gauge Mirror.\n\nHe started to step toward them, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t do anything to Han Sen. He couldn\u2019t take the Star Gauge Mirror back, and Han Sen might even mock him for trying.\n\n\u201cWait here. We are not done yet!\u201d Empty God growled to himself, staring at the father and daughter. He teleported away, still enraged.\n\nWhen Han Sen heard Bao\u2019er yelling for him, he was shocked. A place like Star Tree shouldn\u2019t have some random person moseying about. Han Sen teleported to Bao\u2019er, but he didn\u2019t see the man she had mentioned. But he did notice that Bao\u2019er was holding a small bronze mirror in her hands. She was merrily running toward him.\n\n\u201cDad! Look at this treasure mirror and this gem. A good uncle gave them to me.\u201d Bao\u2019er held out the Star Gauge Mirror and gem toward Han Sen while she spoke.\n\n\u201cWhat good uncle?\u201d Han Sen asked, frowning at the two items.\n\n\u201cI was playing on the Star Fruit earlier\u2026\u201d Bao\u2019er quickly told the story.\n\nAfter Bao\u2019er spoke, Han Sen almost laughed out loud. The man she had met must have been Empty God. Han Sen thought Empty God would go for Exquisite or Li Keer, but he had actually selected Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cOh, Empty God. You were unlucky to select Bao\u2019er. Now you are losing all your treasures. You couldn\u2019t get Bao\u2019er to make a wish, and as you tried, you lost a true god item.\u201d Shaking his head at the thought, Han Sen took the Star Gauge Mirror out of Bao\u2019er\u2019s hands.\n\nGods were allowed to trick people, but they could never lie. If Empty God said that Star Gauge Mirror was a true god item, then it probably was.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mind went to the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, which was a true god weapon. This mirror was of the same level, and according to what Bao\u2019er had said, it would enable him to see the future and the past. Han Sen was so happy about receiving this.\n\nThe black crystal armor was no longer locking down the power in his body, which meant that Empty God must truly have left the vicinity. So, Han Sen cast his Dongxuan Sutra to try and make use of the Star Gauge Mirror. He wanted to see if it was as good as Empty God made it out to be.\n\nAlthough he couldn\u2019t completely activate the power of the Star Gauge Mirror, the Dongxuan Sutra was still able to elicit some response from the Star Gauge Mirror. He tried to use it a few times, but he was ultimately disappointed by the results.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know if his power was too weak to use the Star Gauge Mirror effectively, or if the mirror itself had some restrictions. Either way, the future that the Star Gauge Mirror could display was only a very short scene.\n\nSuch as, when Han Sen used the Star Gauge Mirror to see the future, he could only see a scene. The image flashed across the scene, showing Han Sen sleeping and nothing else.\n\nAnd after Han Sen used it that one time, it took him a whole day to recover the power needed to activate the item again.\n\nHe used it a few times, but the scenes depicting the future turned out to be a pointless waste of time and energy. They were just flashes, after all. He didn\u2019t learn any useful information.\n\nAnd the power to see the past was just as crappy. The Star Gauge Mirror allowed a window into the past, but activating that ability cost a great deal of energy. The further back in time you wished to see, the more power it would cost.\n\nWith Han Sen\u2019s current power, he could only see up to one minute into the past, and the mirror would only show the area within a meter of his location. Using that ability repeatedly would drain his strength at an alarming rate.\n\nThose were the results Han Sen received after rigorous testing. As for the exact rules that governed the use of the Star Gauge Mirror, Han Sen still hadn\u2019t figured them out.\n\nClearly, the Star Gauge Mirror was too high level for him, just like the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. Han Sen\u2019s level and power were not enough to unlock the true power of the item.\n\nBut the mirror\u2019s Mirror Armor was a pleasant surprise. Although Han Sen\u2019s power was limited, the Mirror Armor power didn\u2019t require much energy. He activated the new armor while wearing his Apollo Set, and he found that the two armors reinforced each other. The armor\u2019s defense was as good as a larvae class treasure now.\n\nBut sadly, there was a time limit on the armor. After he activated the ability, Han Sen\u2019s armor would only look like a mirror for a few minutes. Once that time elapsed, he would return to normal.\n\nHan Sen decided that the short duration of all the mirror\u2019s abilities was probably linked to his own lack of power. He just couldn\u2019t effectively make use of a true god weapon.\n\nBao\u2019er wasn\u2019t interested in the Star Gauge Mirror, and she only played with it for a bit before throwing it to Han Sen. Han Sen gladly took it off her hands. The thing would still be useful, and once he became deified, it was bound to be even more useful. After all, the power to look into the past could come incredibly handy once Han Sen became stronger.\n\n\u201cIs there a way for us to get rid of this troublesome Empty God? If he keeps trying to set traps for us, things will turn out very poorly.\u201d Han Sen was a bit annoyed by the man, but he couldn\u2019t think of a way to deal with him just yet.\n\nThe gods kept appearing out of nowhere. They could even come and go as they pleased in a place like Outer Sky. Furthermore, Han Sen didn\u2019t have a way to kill such beings. There was nothing he could do.\n\nHan Sen expected Empty God to return and torment them some more, but over the next few days, the black crystal armor showed no sign of activity. That meant Empty God hadn\u2019t bothered to come back.\n\nThat surprised Han Sen, but only because he was lacking a key piece of information about gods. They could go to any place in the universe freely, but their bodies had many limitations. They couldn\u2019t stay in one place for too long. So, Empty God couldn\u2019t just remain in Outer Sky for as long as he wanted.\n\nBut Empty God was finding a way to deal with Han Sen and his daughter. He first met them through his search for gene protoplasm, but the frustration they had caused him had almost driven the gene protoplasm from his mind.\n\nHan Sen stood by the Star Tree, holding a black crystal. He looked very weird.\n\nThe black crystal armor had released its limitations, so Han Sen could take the black crystal out of his Sea of Soul. Once he had it in his hands again, Han Sen tried to feed the black crystal to another xenogeneic.\n\nHowever, the other creatures that he tested it on didn\u2019t react. It was like the black crystal was now useless.\n\nAnd after Han Sen tried putting his power into the black crystal, he realized that his Dongxuan Sutra no longer did anything to it. But when he activated The Story of Genes inside of himself, the black crystal exhibited some strange changes.\n\nThe black crystal in Han Sen\u2019s hand took on the shape of a miniature Immortal Dragon. Aside from the black color and minute size, it looked exactly like the Immortal Dragon.\n\nHan Sen passed the power of The Story of Genes into the black crystal, and the crystal rose out of his hand and flew down to the ground. It swelled to become a life-size Immortal Dragon. The dragon stared straight at Han Sen, just like the first time they saw each other.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart leaped. The Immortal Dragon\u2019s body released a strong, holy light. It covered a wide area around them. There was a scar in the tree\u2019s surface nearby, which was probably the result of a bug bite. The damage was healed by the Immortal Dragon\u2019s holy light."
