    "text": "\u201cKnight King, the new member you are telling us about is her?\u201d Han Sen looked at Bai Wei strangely.\n\n\u201cYes, Bai Wei is the latest addition to your team. Please co-operate with her.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King smiled.\n\n\u201cKnight King, if there is naught else to discuss, I will return and prepare,\u201d Bai Wei coldly said.\n\n\u201cGo.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King nodded.\n\nBai Wei coldly departed the room. Meanwhile, Han Sen feigned sadness as he spoke again to Ice Blue Knight King. \u201cKnight King, did you see that? She does not even show you respect. How am I supposed to control someone like that? You should give her to another group.\u201d\n\nIce Blue Knight King touched Han Sen\u2019s shoulder before sitting down. He poured out some tea and told Han Sen to take a seat and join him. Han Sen knew Ice Blue Knight King had something to tell him, so he obliged and sat down.\n\nIce Blue Knight King had a sip of his tea and said, \u201cI am not giving her to your team for the purpose of control. She will be with you because I wish for you to protect her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cShe is Queen Bai Wei. You might not have heard of her name before, but you must surely know what it implies,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said.\n\n\u201cA daughter of one of the Extreme King\u2019s kings?\u201d Han Sen immediately understood why she had been so cocky. If she was a daughter of an Extreme King king, then she had what it took to behave the way she did.\n\n\u201cShe has made mistakes, so a king seeks to punish her by sending her here. But the king also wishes for her to practice more. While that must be done, I cannot afford anything ill to befall her, so you must ensure she remains protected. If something happens to her, you and I will both be killed.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King smiled.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find a high-level knight to look after her, then? I doubt there is much I can do to protect her.\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile, and he thought the task was a bad one to receive.\n\n\u201cIf there was a King class fellow protecting her, she would not have the opportunity to practice. Plus, she is full of pride. She would not allow that.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King let out a sigh.\n\n\u201cThe Ice Blue Knights have many backup teams. Surely you need not rely on outsiders like us. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s dangerous to task outsiders with such an important responsibility?\u201d Han Sen looked at Ice Blue Knight King as he spoke.\n\nIce Blue Knight King looked back at Han Sen, and then he spoke in a strange tone of voice. \u201cHan Sen, do you know who I trust the most out of the Ice Blue Knights?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do. Your subordinates,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nIce Blue Knight King shook his head and resumed his gaze on Han Sen. He told him, \u201cIt is you. I trust you the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have got to be kidding me. I have only just met you\u2026\u201d Before Han Sen could finish speaking, Ice Blue Knight King stopped him.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m actually joking about this. You have never been in my position. You would not understand the reasons for me only being able to trust you. And so, I am letting you look after Queen Bai Wei. If she lives, you live. If she dies, you die. You are a smart boy, so I believe you know what to do.\u201d Ice Blue Knight King patted Han Sen on the shoulder and then left the office.\n\nHan Sen did not want to be burdened with the troubles of other people like that, but Ice Blue Knight King had made it quite clear that his problems did not solely rely on renegade xenogeneics. There were troubles stemming from the internal affairs of the Ice Blue Knights.\n\nBut Ice Blue Knight King, after stressing the need for Han Sen to do that which was bidden of him, had Han Sen forfeit reluctance and accept the task.\n\nHan Sen kept thinking all the while he walked back to his room. His heart jumped, and his pupils shrunk when he neared there. All the hairs on his body stood on end.\n\nNo scary power attacked him, and neither did a foreign presence, but Han Sen felt as if he was being watched by a snake. He felt as if he were in danger all of a sudden.\n\nHan Sen looked forward, and there he saw a slender body approaching from up ahead.\n\nThat should have been a pure Extreme King man, but his presence was hidden. Being unable to determine his level, the man looked like the average person.\n\nThe delicate face of the man was like a jade sculpture that had been meticulously crafted by the hands of a genuine master. His blonde hair was smart, and the face carried eyes as deep as lakes that could reflect the world and people they looked upon. It looked nice.\n\nHe was a shockingly perfect looking man. While he seemed very pleasant, Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but internally scream at the potential for danger in his proximity.\n\nHan Sen walked close to the man, and the man stared at Han Sen. Just as they were about to pass each other, the man stopped and said coldly, \u201cHave you seen the secret held by the stone plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. He stopped and looked at him.\n\nThe man smiled at Han Sen, and to a man like Han Sen, that smile was as warm as the sun. It could melt the coldest blocks of ice, and if he was speaking to a woman, that woman would do anything he commanded her to do.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. The man merely smiled and walked past Han Sen.\n\n\u201cEdward.\u201d Han Sen did not look at the man. He just kept going. He walked straight to his room. He had never seen that man before, but he was quick to understand that it was Inspector Edward.\n\n\u201cIt seems as if he knows I am the one that took the stone plate. What an annoying and dangerous guy. If he is an inspector, though, then that means he should be a King,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nEdward walked into a room. There was an Ice Blue Knight there that was looking at a camera recording. The video was playing the encounter between Han Sen and Edward.\n\n\u201cHis reactions are natural. It doesn\u2019t look as if he is pretending. Perhaps we are wrong,\u201d the Ice Blue Knight said.\n\nEdward looked at the video and laughed like spring sunshine. \u201cWe are right, actually. He is the one that took the stone plate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight gazed at Edward with suspicion.\n\n\u201cHe behaved too naturally when he saw me. Not many Marquises can remain that natural upon seeing me. The more natural they are, the more suspicious they are.\u201d Edward stared at Han Sen\u2019s face on the screen. I did not know Knife Queen had selected such an interesting student.\n\n\u201cShould we move?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight did not proclaim his thoughts on Edward\u2019s assessment, so he posed the question.\n\n\u201cNo. Ice Blue Knight King and Mister White are still here. We cannot fight while they are here.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cBut these are the systems of chaos, and so it is not as if he could run. He is interesting, but he is just a Marquise. Therefore, he is weak.\n\n\u201cMister Inspector, do you think he is one of Mister White\u2019s people?\u201d The Ice Blue Knight asked.\n\n\u201cNo. If he was, then Mister White would be the one with the item right now. Do you think Mister White would still stay with the knights and provide us the opportunity to get it back?\u201d Edward looked at Han Sen\u2019s face with interest. \u201cThis guy is funny. If he took the relic, we must get the relic back before the other knights find out. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be annoying.\u201d"
