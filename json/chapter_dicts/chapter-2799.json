    "text": "\u201cEven if I know he is the red-robed child, it will be pointless if I cannot find a way to control it. Even Mister Yin was unable to control it. So, that means I will have to ask the Grandmaster. But the Grandmaster went to the big barren systems, so I do not think he will be back anytime soon.\u201d Bai Wanjie sighed. He quickly thought of someone else.\n\n\u201cI need to get Mister White from the Winter Garden.\u201d Bai Wanjie summoned a servant and gave him a pass. He told him, \u201cBe polite to Mister White. Do not offend him.\u201d\n\nThe servant accepted the pass and departed. Bai Wanjie thought, Mister White has a lot of knowledge. Before he was deified, he had already accomplished many shocking things. After becoming deified, he has only become even better. With his weird powers, we might stand a chance.\n\n\u201cGreetings, Mister Crown Prince.\u201d Mister White went to the crown prince\u2019s manor and bowed before Bai Wanjie.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for such modesty.\u201d Bai Wanjie lifted Mister White and said, \u201cToday, I have asked you to come here because there is something you must understand. I hope you will be able to help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me what it is, Mister Crown Prince, \u201d Mister White gently said. \u201cIf I know how to fix what bothers you, it will be my pleasure to do just that.\u201d\n\nBai Wanjie told him about Mister Yin using Ghost Head Fall on Han Sen and how he ended up dying, but he did not tell him about Han Sen\u2019s story or where he had come from.\n\nAfter hearing this, Mister White thought for a moment. He soon said, \u201cI will need to take a look at the xenogeneic first. Only then can I examine it and give you the accurate answer you seek, Mister Crown Prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do that.\u201d Bai Wanjie took Mister White over to the supergravity cabin that contained Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen saw Bai Wanjie had brought Mister White with him. When he did, he suddenly felt happy. Yet, he did not dare show that happiness on his face. He looked at Bai Wanjie and gave him a look of scornful mocking.\n\n\u201cThat is the xenogeneic, Mister White.\u201d Bai Wanjie did not care. He gestured toward Mister White.\n\nMister White walked in front of Han Sen and checked him out. He reached a hand out to touch Han Sen\u2019s head. On the other hand, he was counting his fingers as if he was calculating something.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face was full of disdain. His heart was jumping, but he did not seek to give him any hints in case Bai Wanjie saw it.\n\nEven if Bai Wanjie didn\u2019t see it, there were cameras. If Bai Wanjie went to look at the cameras, he would notice something. That would only lead to harm upon Mister White.\n\nHan Sen thought, With Mister White\u2019s power, he must be able to recognize me.\n\nMister White did not seem to show any sign of knowing that. His face did not change. He acted as if Han Sen was a total stranger. He touched every inch of Han Sen\u2019s body and returned to Bai Wanjie.\n\nAfter all that time, however, Han Sen did not see any changes in Mister White\u2019s eyes.\n\nDid Mister White not recognize me? Han Sen felt a bit sad about that, but he could not hint at him in any way.\n\n\u201cDid you find out anything?\u201d Bai Wanjie asked.\n\nMister White looked at Han Sen before replying to Bai Wanjie. \u201cWe should talk about it when we\u2019re out of here.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that, Han Sen felt a chill. Did Mister White recognize me?\n\nBai Wanjie understood and gestured for them to exit. He and Mister White left the supergravity cabin.\n\nHe took Mister White to a lobby. After they sat down, Bai Wanjie said, \u201cWe can talk in here. You can tell me anything.\u201d\n\nMister White did not reply. It seemed as if he was trying to find a way to compose what he wished to say. A while later, he said, \u201cFrom what I have been able to tell, Mister Yin should not have used Ghost Head Fall on him. Mister Yin had just become a transmutation class. Even if he was larvae class or even butterfly class, using Ghost Head Fall would have likely resulted in his death.\u201d\n\nBai Wanjie was surprised, so he asked, \u201cOh, why is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have guessed correctly, that xenogeneic came from the Space Garden,\u201d Mister White slowly said. \u201cIs that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know where it came from?\u201d Bai Wanjie was shocked. He had not told Mister White where Han Sen had come from, yet Mister White had been able to guess it. That was unbelievable.\n\nMister White quietly said, \u201cI am good at predicting. It is not hard to see where it came from.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really are a genius, but what is that supposed to mean?\u201d Bai Wanjie now believed Mister White.\n\n\u201cFrom what I have seen, the Space Garden is a plant xenogeneic that is true god class,\u201d Mister White replied. \u201cIts power is very unique. Even if a true god-class elite tried to, it may not enter the Space Garden.\u201d\n\nBai Wanjie saw that Mister White was able to tell the secrets of the place. Thus, he believed him even more.\n\nThe secrets of the Space Garden being a true god xenogeneic was not something many people knew. He had only heard the secret from Bai King once before.\n\nMister White was from a small race that was raised by the Extreme King, yet he knew this secret. Bai Wanjie believed Mister White even more.\n\n\u201cEarlier, I calculated this xenogeneic\u2019s identity. If I have guessed correctly, he is the son of the Space Garden. When the Space Garden raised him, he earned many special abilities. So, he is not just a born-deified. He has two talents. He is a special child that can conquer the universe.\u201d\n\nMister White paused and said, \u201cI believe that something strange must have happened in the Space Garden that made many creatures die. That is what must have happened when he was born. When this special child was born, its lifeforce and genes were scarier than ordinary born-deifieds. He is almost immortal. Other people might be able to kill it, but taking its mind is an impossible task.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that is true, how can I control him?\u201d Bai Wanjie knew Mister White hadn\u2019t gone to the Space Garden, but he spoke like he had been. He had not missed a single part, which made him very confused.\n\n\u201cWith my power, I do not think I can help you,\u201d Mister White said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find the Grandmaster to help? With his power, I am sure you can tame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Grandmaster is out on business, and I am afraid he will not be back soon.\u201d Bai Wanjie could see there was more for Mister White to say, so he asked, \u201cMister White, is there no other way?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not that there is not another way, but it would be very troublesome,\u201d Mister White said.\n\n\u201cPlease tell me, Mister White,\u201d Bai Wanjie said with glee.\n\n\u201cIf you want to control this child, perhaps you can go and make use of the Extreme King\u2019s Overbearing Eye,\u201d Mister White slowly said."
