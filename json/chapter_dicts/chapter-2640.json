    "text": "\u201cWhat should I tell her? Am I just supposed to walk up and tell her that I want to join the Very High despite everything that happened? I would feel so cheap after the fuss I made,\u201d Han Sen thought. He was on his way to the Sky\u2019s Water House. He considered many different ways that he might approach the subject with Exquisite, but nothing he came up with seemed very good. When Han Sen arrived at the doorstep of the Water House, he came face to face with Exquisite. She still looked rather pale. She opened her mouth to speak, but no sound came out.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t jump straight into this conversation. I just can\u2019t,\u201d Han Sen thought, suppressing a wry smile.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Are you looking for me?\u201d Exquisite asked Han Sen, her face completely expressionless. It seemed as if her failure in the fight hadn\u2019t affected her as much as he had expected. She seemed a little tired, but other than that, she looked the same as always.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 Well, I\u2019m here to see if you have recovered yet.\u201d As soon as Han Sen said that, he wanted to slap himself. It sounded as if he was there to rub her loss in her face.\n\n\u201cI have almost healed.\u201d Exquisite didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 that\u2019s great\u2026\u201d Although Han Sen wasn\u2019t eloquent on the best of days, he normally wasn\u2019t this awkward. This time, however, he was lost and fumbling. He didn\u2019t know how to say what he wanted to.\n\nExquisite stared back at Han Sen, allowing an uncomfortable silence to settle between them. Han Sen opened his mouth a few times, but he couldn\u2019t summon the words. In the end, he said, \u201cThen\u2026 I will not disturb your recovery.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen got up and prepared to leave. He felt so nervous. He was unable to tell her what he wanted to.\n\nThen he heard someone giggle.\n\nExquisite suddenly laughed. It shocked Han Sen. He didn\u2019t know what she was laughing about, but she sure looked like a far finer woman when she did.\n\nExquisite saw Han Sen\u2019s glance. She blushed for a moment, and then her face returned to its impassive expression. She met Han Sen\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cSky Palace Leader told me you have thought over the offer. You are now willing to follow me to the Very High. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat old b*stard sold me out again!\u201d Han Sen swore in his head, suddenly looking even more uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t think Exquisite knew why he had come to visit her, but it seemed as if she was expecting him. And there he was, making a fool of himself. No wonder Exquisite had felt compelled to laugh. He could see the humor, though, and he knew that someday, he would look back on this and chuckle.\n\nAt that point, Han Sen realized that being embarrassed wasn\u2019t doing him any good. He relaxed and nodded. \u201cYes, I would like to go to the Very High with you. I hope you don\u2019t mind accepting me, even after everything that has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you change your mind?\u201d Exquisite asked, still not moving a muscle.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons, and I can\u2019t explain them all. What is most important for me, though, are the resources I will need.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s explanation was very vague.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going back to the Very High in two days. You should prepare yourself,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He hadn\u2019t thought Exquisite would be so easy to talk to. She agreed to take him on very quickly.\n\nHan Sen opened his mouth, but again, he wasn\u2019t sure what to say to her. Since the start of this conversation, it had felt as if he had done nothing but say the wrong thing. So, Han Sen just decided to bid her farewell for the time being\n\nWhen Han Sen left, the remote expression on Exquisite\u2019s face evaporated. She suddenly seemed very conflicted.\n\nThere were only two days for Han Sen to prepare. Fortunately, there wasn\u2019t much for him to actually take care of. He only told the people closest to him that he would be leaving soon.\n\nWhen Han Sen told Lone Bamboo, Lone Bamboo quietly asked, \u201cYou still decided on going?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, I won\u2019t be able to get my hands on the Constellation Sea. I must go,\u201d Han Sen said glumly, spreading his hands in a helpless gesture.\n\n\u201cI hope to see you back here alive,\u201d Lone Bamboo ultimately said after a long pause.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it like you expect me to end up dead. I will be back in four years,\u201d Han Sen said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cIf you were going like a normal silkworm, then four years would be a short time. But you have an ulterior motive for signing up. Your trip to the Very High will be dangerous, and your chance of surviving is low.\u201d Lone Bamboo clearly didn\u2019t know much about tact, but what he said was the truth.\n\nLooking for someone wasn\u2019t a crime, but lying about his intentions wouldn\u2019t be taken kindly by the Very High. If he was found out, there was a high chance of severe consequences and punishments.\n\nBut Han Sen was confident that there was a way to stop the Very High from looking into his mind. If he hadn\u2019t been sure he would be okay, he wouldn\u2019t have risked going to the Very High at all.\n\nAfter he got everything ready, Han Sen headed back to Black King City one last time. He said goodbye to the people there, then he went to see Sky Palace Leader.\n\nSky Palace Leader said that he had a method that would keep the Very High out of Han Sen\u2019s mind. Although Han Sen didn\u2019t place much faith in the idea, he did not mind hearing the leader\u2019s technique.\n\nTwo days went by in a flash. Han Sen brought Bao\u2019er and Exquisite to a ship that would take them away from Sky Palace. Exquisite plotted a course for their destination.\n\nMany creatures had been chosen by the Very High over the years, but even now, not many people knew where the Very High actually resided.According to what Sky Palace Leader said, the Very High xenogeneic space could be moved. It wasn\u2019t in a fixed location. Unless someone had just been there, it would be impossible to determine where it was.\n\n\u201cIt is a xenogeneic space that can move.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t think it was all that special. He had already seen Sky Palace use the Chase Star Whip to move Narrow Moon.\n\nHe wagered that if Sky Palace could do it, the superior Very High could very likely do the same. Moving a xenogeneic space shouldn\u2019t have been too difficult for them.\n\nAfter the ship departed Sky Palace, Exquisite enabled auto-pilot for the ship to command itself. She pulled out a little leaf-sized ship. It hovered in the air, then began to swell. It became the size of an ordinary ship. \u201cWe are taking this ship to the Very High?\u201d Han Sen and Bao\u2019er looked over the second ship with curiosity.\n\n\u201cOnly this ship can take us back,\u201d Exquisite said. She got onto that new ship and sat down in the front.\n\nHan Sen brought Bao\u2019er onto the small ship. After they sat down, Exquisite tapped the surface of the ship. The rowboat-shaped ship suddenly started flying. In one moment, the ship broke space and slipped into subspace. When Han Sen saw the Very High\u2019s xenogeneic space, he was awestruck.\n\nThe Very High\u2019s xenogeneic space seemed to reside in subspace. Before this trip, Han Sen never even would have imagined that it was possible to maintain a landmass within subspace. Han Sen was flabbergasted. He was numbed by the vista.\n\n\u201cDo anti-matter worlds really exist?\u201d Han Sen murmured to himself, gazing out the viewports of the ship. \u201cActually, this place is a buffer zone between the real world and anti-matter worlds. This isn\u2019t a true anti-matter world. You can call it subspace, but we call it Outer Sky,\u201d Exquisite explained. \u201cHas this land always existed here, or was it moved here?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at the heavenly landmass in front of him."
