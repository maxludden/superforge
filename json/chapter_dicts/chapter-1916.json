    "text": "Without the plants, the red mist had smothered the entire cave. Fortunately, Han Sen had his Dongxuan Aura to help him see things clearly.\n\nAfter they entered the cave, the minks returned to where they were born. Then, they started digging with their little paws. They wanted to burrow through the stone. The little minks had just been born, however, and they were only Baron class. They were still very weak, so they could only leave small scratches across the rock.\n\nHan Sen commanded them to fly back inside his pocket. Then, he pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and activated his Jadeskin light. Then, he got to digging the ground in their stead.\n\nAll seven of the minks popped their heads out of his pocket. Their fluffy heads all lined up to watch Han Sen dig through the stone.\n\nHan Sen, after a little while of digging, had created a pit that was two meters deep. Suddenly, there was a dong noise. He wasn\u2019t sure what the knife had hit, but it sounded like it had struck metal. And furthermore, whatever it was did not sound broken.\n\nHan Sen examined the bottom of the pit and saw something of a grey and white color. Han Sen dug up the stones around it, and he realized it was a bone. Only one inch of the bone was showing, but it was obviously much larger than that. What the bone might have belonged to, he wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nSo, Han Sen swung his Ghost Teeth Knife and resumed digging. When he unearthed not one but multiple bones, he was given a shock.\n\nIt appeared to be a complete skeleton that was more than four meters long. It was that of a creature with four legs. It looked like the skeleton of a Red Mist Mink.\n\nIt was dead, of course. And there it was, with only the bones remaining. The Ghost Teeth Knife was incapable of breaking the bones, and only faint marks were left on them. You could tell that its level must have been quite high before its passing.\n\nHan Sen examined the bones for quite a long, but he found no source of xenogeneic genes. This was surprising.\n\n\u201cWeird. Did someone kill this xenogeneic and take its xenogeneic materials?\u201d Han Sen thought that was incorrect, though. If it had been killed, why would the bones show zero signs of damage?\n\nHan Sen did not know what to do, so he allowed the seven little minks to hop out of his pocket. Han Sen thought their purpose here was to check out these bones, but when they entered the pit Han Sen had dug, they went into a specific corner and kept on digging.\n\nHan Sen was not a patient fellow, and he had no interest in waiting for them to complete the task of digging. So, with Ghost Teeth Knife, he took over the spot they were digging. He dug out two feet of stone before he came across something else.\n\nA red mist started to ascend from it.\n\nBefore Han Sen could see what it was, the seven little minks jumped inside. They all ran into the red mist and disappeared.\n\nHan Sen looked closer, and there, he noticed an orb that was around the size of a grapefruit. It looked very clear, as if it had been made of crystal.\n\nBut the red mist there made Han Sen believe it wasn\u2019t real. And now the minks had vanished.\n\nHan Sen dug out the orb and took a look. He was given another shock.\n\nInside the orb, amidst the mist, there was a red palace. It looked like a suitable habitation for a god.\n\nFor some reason, the seven minks had gone inside the crystal orb. They appeared before the red palace, and then resumed trying to scratch their way in. They were trying to dig into the palace. There were no gaps in the walls, though. They were too weak, and they could not push open the doors to the place.\n\nHan Sen looked at the nameplate of the palace. There were three words on it, but Han Sen could not read them. They weren\u2019t of a language belonging to the humans or the crystallizers, and neither were they from a language that existed in the geno universe.\n\n\u201cHow did they get inside there?\u201d Han Sen was playing with the crystal orb, trying to activate it. Nothing he did seemed to work.\n\nIf this was a treasure of some kind, it might require a very special element to activate it.\n\n\u201cIf those seven little minks could enter the orb, that must mean that their power is the same as the orb\u2019s power. I can cast powers with my Dongxuan Aura. Perhaps I can simulate the lifeforce of the little mink and get it to work,\u201d Han Sen thought.\n\nHan Sen was wondering how to get the seven minks out first, though. It was then that he realized the mist inside the cave was starting to fade. The spring was on the precipice of erupting.\n\nHan Sen quit his stalling, put the crystal orb in his pocket, and ran out of the cave.\n\nThe valley\u2019s mist was starting to fade. Something was sucking it all away.\n\nHan Sen followed the subsiding flow of the red mist until he reached a place where the red mist was going into the ground. There was a big hole there now, and the red mist was drifting down into it.\n\nThe mist around him was getting thinner and thinner, and it was then that Han Sen heard the sound of fighting. It must have been the Viscounts, rushing into the valley.\n\nNothing was coming out of the spring, though, so Han Sen stood there as if he was guarding it. He waited for a flow to begin.\n\nNot long after, Sword Know made it deep into the valley. The red mist in the valley was almost all gone, and that was when he saw Han Sen. He coldly laughed, \u201cHan Sen, it is useless, even if you did come early. You still have to wait for the spring!\u201d\n\nMany Viscounts were approaching behind Sword Know. Many xenogeneics were on their way, as well. They were all fighting hard.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t be bothered to talk to him, so he just sat down to wait.\n\nSword Know was next to the eye of the spring. He found a decent spot, and he got to killing the xenogeneics around him. Whenever the xenogeneics came within ten meters, he\u2019d kill them quick.\n\n\u201cEarl!\u201d Han Sen frowned. Sword Know had not used spirit power, but his swordlight power was better than that of a Viscount.\n\nHan Sen reviewed the documents and read that only Viscounts could come.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here if you are an Earl!\u201d Han Sen shouted over to Sword Know.\n\nSword Know hummed and said, \u201cI was a Viscount when I came. Am I not allowed to level up?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Sword Know looked at the other Viscounts sent by the other Kings. Then, he coldly laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who became an Earl here.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked around. He saw a few Viscounts that were stronger than what Viscounts should have been capable of. He also saw Moon Wheel King\u2019s daughter Rebecca.\n\n\u201cYou guys have really worked hard for this,\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\n\u201cStay away from me, in case I hurt you by mistake. You know I have only just leveled up to Earl, so I can\u2019t really control my newfound powers all that well,\u201d Sword Know said threateningly."
