    "text": "Barr was a primitive deified elite. With his full power, he could devastate a planet with a single punch. But he couldn\u2019t resist those branches that reached out and began to wrap themselves around him. The branches tied him up like a cocoon, with only his head poking out above the leaves.\n\nBarr wasn\u2019t the only one to be caught; even the transmutation class Elder Nader was unable to escape. He released his power in a massive surge, but under the force of the branches, his power was like snow melting under a spring sun. His attempts to protect himself dissolved into nothing, and then the branches bound him firmly.\n\nNo creature upon the plank bridge was exempted from this. They were all tied up in cocoons of various sizes, and soon they were all dangling helplessly from the bridge.\n\nAs Han Sen looked at them, he was struck by how much they looked like caterpillars. He had often found those insects hanging from the trees near his old house. They would hang from the branches, motionless unless a wind caught them and waved them back and forth. The sight before him was eerily similar.\n\nHan Sen kept observing the captured creatures, falling back as he did. Even Elder Nader had been unable to resist the ensnaring branches. Han Sen didn\u2019t think he was much stronger than Elder Nader. If he got close, he might end up suffering the same fate. He didn\u2019t want to end up snared by the branches, too.\n\nDragon One and Bao Lian seemed to share his opinion. They all made sure to retreat with haste.\n\nThe squawking of a bird sounded clearly throughout the sky. Within a second, Han Sen felt a very frightening presence descending on the strange realm. It rushed down from the sky in a blur, moving too quickly for them to react. It was like watching a plane crash. Although the bird itself remained in the sky, the weight of the bird\u2019s aura hit the ground, instantly crushing anything on the surface.\n\nHan Sen found that his body had been slammed down into the dirt, and he couldn\u2019t get up. The scary pressure was slowly pushing him into the ground like it was made of quicksand. His face had almost been crushed. He couldn\u2019t get out.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face was on its side, trying to discern where the sound of that bird came from. Far away, up in the sky, he saw a large bird burning with a white flame. It was soaring through the air, and the very scary pressure came from its body.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t be certain what kind of bird it was. It looked elegant, proud, gorgeous, majestic; it was like a god from the sky. It was like the legends that described the god phoenix. But Han Sen had never seen a real phoenix before, so he couldn\u2019t be sure if he was seeing one now.\n\nThe big bird was soaring casually over the mountain. Wherever it went, the landscape beneath it came back to life. Every tree, bush, and blade of grass was brimming with lifeforce once more.\n\nThe big bird flew in slow circles, and it seemed like the whole world was following it, hoping to be given a lifeforce again. The green trees were repopulated with leaves. Flowers were popping up out of the ground. Wherever the bird went, new life followed behind. The deserted wasteland was turning into a tropical paradise.\n\n\u201cA phoenix\u2026 It really is a phoenix\u2026\u201d Bao Lian was lying on the ground next to Han Sen. He stared up blankly, seemingly at a loss for how to react.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so unlucky recently. I entered an undeveloped xenogeneic space and found a true god class xenogeneic phoenix. The chances of that are lower than winning the lottery,\u201d Han Sen grumbled in his heart.\n\nFortunately, the phoenix wasn\u2019t flying toward them. It flew to the plank bridging the Two Ape Mountain. It glided slowly forward on its huge wings until it reached the bridge.\n\nAfter circling the bridge three times, the phoenix with its white flames descended onto the wood. The fire on its body didn\u2019t harm the wood. It actually seemed to be forcing more lifeforce into the plank, and it made the branches grow even faster.\n\nThe phoenix then lowered its head to look at the creature nearest to it. The creature looked like a golem from what Han Sen could see through the cocoon of branches. Only the golem\u2019s head was clearly visible.\n\n\u201cAnswer a question for me. If the answer satisfies me, then I will forgive you for offending me.\u201d The phoenix didn\u2019t physically speak, but everyone who could see the phoenix could hear its voice in their minds.\n\n\u201cI will answer any question you would like me to. What do you want to know?\u201d the golem-like creature said.\n\n\u201cOne day, you and your partner encounter danger. One of you has to die for the other to be saved, and you have the power to decide\u2026 Do you choose to die for your partner to be saved? Or would you prefer that your partner perish so that you could live?\u201d\n\nThe voice of the phoenix rumbled, shaking their minds as it spoke.\n\nEveryone was shocked. They had expected the deity to ask about some ancient secret. They never expected a question like this.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t seem like the question had a single correct answer. Different people would respond in different ways.\n\nBut since the phoenix had already asked, the golem couldn\u2019t refuse to answer. It swallowed and replied, \u201cI would sacrifice myself to save my partner so that she could live.\u201d\n\n\u201cHypocrite.\u201d The phoenix\u2019s voice played in everyone\u2019s head. It sounded disdainful.\n\nThe next second, Han Sen and the others watched the phoenix lower its head. It opened its beak in the golem\u2019s direction.\n\nBut the phoenix didn\u2019t bite down. Rather, it made a sucking motion, as if it was drawing in a breath. A weird power came out of the golem\u2019s body and vanished into the phoenix\u2019s mouth.\n\nAfter that strange power was taken away, the golem\u2019s head looked like a dried-up husk. Then, the entire creature turned into sand and scattered across the wind. No trace of the being was left to see.\n\nEveryone stared at the place where the golem had been in silence. Although the golem was just a King class creature, its power had been drained until it was nothing more than dust. It was a bit too scary to fully comprehend.\n\nThe phoenix didn\u2019t seem to think that what it had done was a big deal. Ignoring the sand that was still leaking from the now-empty cocoon, the phoenix moved to the next cocooned creature like it was walking down the aisle in a grocery store.\n\nThis creature\u2019s head looked like it belonged to an octopus or squid. Han Sen recognized this one. This being had been following Elder Nader, so it had to be one of Elder Nader\u2019s students.\n\nThat creature turned pale when the phoenix looked at him. And then, he heard the phoenix\u2019s voice sound again. Once more, it was in everyone\u2019s head. \u201cOne day, you and your partner encounter danger. One of you has to die for the other to be saved, and you have the power to decide. Do you choose to die for your partner to be saved? Or would you prefer that your partner perish so that you could live?\u201d\n\nThat creature was terrified, but it noticed that the question was exactly the same as before. He was so happy.\n\nThe golem had already given one answer, and that answer was wrong. So, the squid creature assumed that the other answer must be correct.\n\nThinking of that, the creature hastily shouted, \u201cI would choose to save myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cObscene.\u201d Before the creature could explain why he had chosen to save himself at his partner\u2019s expense, the phoenix\u2019s angry voice rumbled in everyone\u2019s heads.\n\nThe phoenix lowered its head and drew in a breath. The creature\u2019s power was ripped out of it, and the body turned into dust. The wind carried it away.\n\nA chill sank into the hearts of all the onlookers, and goosebumps flared all over their skin. They thought that giving a different answer to the question would allow them to live. But now, it seemed as if the question posed by the phoenix had no correct answer. It all depended on the phoenix\u2019s mood."
