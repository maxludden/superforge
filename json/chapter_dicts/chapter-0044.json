    "text": "Han Sen could tell that Yang Manli did not like him. When he was ready to go, Yang Manli answered a comlink call and Qin Xuan\u2019s holographic image popped out.\n\n\"Manli, come to my office right now.\" Qin Xuan saw Han Sen there and said, \"Bring him with you.\"\n\nHan Sen followed Yang Manli to Qin Xuan\u2019s office and saw Qin Xuan watching a video from the Skynet.\n\n\"Manli, come see this video.\" Qin Xuan replayed it.\n\nStanding on the side, Han Sen secretly thought, \"This is the video of me taking the physical test! Someone paid to record this. People must have found out that I\u2019m Dollar.\"\n\nThere were so many halls in the test center, and it cost money to watch others taking the test. He thought no one would care about a nobody like himself and did not expect this to happen.\n\nIf Son of Heaven knew Dollar was Han Sen, he would be in a lot of trouble. Starry Group was powerful in the Alliance, and there was no way Han Sen could compete with them.\n\n\"Dollar? You know who he is?\" Yang Manli was somewhat surprised to see the golden figure in the video.\n\n\"No. The video only covered the robot channel, and he was wearing beast soul armor the entire time. Couldn\u2019t tell who he is.\"\n\nQin Xuan's words suddenly sent Han Sen from hell back to heaven. He secretly wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.\n\n\"I have to be more careful. This time I got lucky, next time there may really be a leak,\" Han Sen secretly warned himself.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Yang Manli only said one word after watching it.\n\n\"Son of Heaven told me about this video. After watching this, we can be certain that Dollar\u2019s armor is a sacred-blood beast soul, and he must be from a prominent family because he is definitely practicing an advanced hyper geno art. Another clue was that he took the test on Planet Roca. We must find him. He can be of great value to us,\" Qin Xuan said.\n\nYang Manli thought about it and said, \"There are no prominent families on Roca. Maybe he was just passing by and has left by now.\"\n\n\"I agree. Let\u2019s give it a shot. He\u2019s worth it,\" said Qin Xuan.\n\nHan Sen was frightened that Qin Xuan and Yang Manli might find out the truth. Han Sen cleared his throat and said, \"Dollar was just relying on his sacred-blood beast souls. He had no real skills. There\u2019s no need to look for him.\"\n\nYang Manli gave Han Sen a hard look and said, \"What do you know? The ability to get the beast souls is enough proof of his ability. Also, those beast souls can be of great use to Bullseye.\"\n\n\"What ability?\" Han Sen thought. \"It\u2019s just pure luck.\"\n\n\"Manli is right. His armor brings amazing defense, and bloody slayer has strengthened his physical strength and speed. Coupled with his practice of advanced hyper geno arts, he must be able to contain most sacred-blood creatures, and that\u2019s very useful to us,\" said Qin Xuan.\n\n\"If we have him in our gang, we won\u2019t have to collaborate with Son of Heaven and Fist Guy anymore to hunt sacred-blood creatures,\" Yang Manli said with great hope.\n\n\"Wow. You just wanted me to risk my life as your tank. How vicious!\" thought Han Sen, drinking from a cup to cover up his fear.\n\n\"Agreed. So, do your best to find him,\" Qin Xuan nodded.\n\n\"But since he\u2019s from a prominent family, even if we find him, he may not be willing to join us,\" Yang Manli sighed.\n\nQin Xuan blinked and joked, \"I know you like a strong man like him. Try to seduce him.\"\n\n\"Ahem!\" Han Sen choked on the water he was drinking.\n\nYang Manli gave Han Sen a fierce glare, and Han Sen quickly took another sip from his cup.\n\n\"I don\u2019t mind seducing him. I\u2019m only afraid he isn\u2019t man enough.\"\n\n\"Ahem!\" This time, Han Sen choked so hard that he was almost in tears.\n\nYang Manli looked at Han Sen with disgust, \"Fortunately, Dollar won\u2019t be a scum like him.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" yelled Han Sen. Yang Manli shut the office door and completely ignored him.\n\n\"Stationmaster, your minion is too arrogant. I\u2019m your guy and she shouldn\u2019t talk to me like that,\" Han Sen said with anger. \"Transfer me to another team. I don\u2019t want to be in Bullseye where she is the leader.\"\n\nHan Sen was a little worried that Yang Manli would see that he was Dollar if he stayed close to her for a long time.\n\nQin Xuan patted Han Sen on the shoulder, \"You were a scum, but you can change. Follow Manli\u2019s lead. Although you may never be like Dollar, you could stop being a scum. There is still hope.\"\n\nSending Han Sen out, she did not give him a chance to speak again.\n\nHan Sen left the teleport station, went back home and checked out the video on the Skynet. He then found out that the video had more than a hundred million hits.\n\nHan Sen made sure that he couldn\u2019t be identified from the video and felt relieved. Seeing the compliments under the video, he was quite pleased with himself: \"Looks great indeed.\""
