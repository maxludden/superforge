However, in that time, Han Sen\u2019s Crystal Furnace reached beginner level. After all, it was a geno art for crystallizer children. It wasn\u2019t very difficult to come to grips with. And having crystal blood made it even easier to learn.\n\nHumans were the offspring of crystallizers, so crystallizer geno arts were quite compatible with human physiology. It only took Han Sen a few days to learn the geno art, and he produced some good results to boot. Now, Han Sen was able to eat twenty to thirty King xenogeneic genes a day. And that was just at the beginner level of Crystal Furnace. If Consume, Big Destroyed, and Crystal Furnace all reached peak performance, he calculated that he could eat at least 110 xenogeneic genes a day.\n\n\u201cCrystal Furnace isn\u2019t bad. I need to teach it to Bao\u2019er and Ling\u2019er, too.\u201d When Han Sen thought about his baby daughters, it felt as if he took an arrow to the heart.\n\nBut escaping the fortress wouldn\u2019t be easy. In the past, he would have tried to escape using his super god body. Because Wan\u2019er was in his Destiny\u2019s Tower, however, he couldn\u2019t use his super god body for very long. Making his escape would take longer than he could maintain his invincible form.\n\nHan Sen sat down and rested. He brought out one of his Alliance beverages and had a couple of sips. But after he did, the little Crocodile God ran over to him and stared at the bottle of wine. It seemed very curious.\n\nHan Sen raised an eyebrow. He pulled out a cup and poured some wine for the small Crocodile God.\n\nThis time, the little crocodile didn\u2019t smack the cup away with its tail. It rolled out its tongue and tentatively approached the cup.\n\nHan Sen was so happy. At first he thought that the little crocodile enjoyed drinking, but instead, the Crocodile God used its tongue to lift the cup and splash itself with the contents.\n\nIts scales were very high in temperature. The creature had tried to lower the heat of its scales, but when the wine touched its body, the liquid flashed into steam.\n\nThe small Crocodile God looked unsatisfied. So, it used its tongue to snatch the entire bottle of wine this time. It upended the bottle over itself.\n\nAs he watched the wonderful wine boil away, Han Sen\u2019s heart ached. It was a bottle of the wine that Ji Yanran had prepared for him. It was a century-old, and it could no longer be purchased anywhere. It was a very rare item.\n\nBut the small Crocodile God seemed to really enjoy it, and its body reeked of alcohol.\n\nThe little Crocodile God made an inquisitive rumbling noise as Han Sen mourned the loss of his wine. It turned out that the crocodile wanted more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any more wine. If you want, I can go back and get you some more,\u201d Han Sen offered to the small Crocodile God.\n\nThe little creature nodded and gave a low roar, as if it was hurrying Han Sen to go and fetch the wine.\n\n\u201cYou will let me go back? If that\u2019s true, then I will leave.\u201d Han Sen didn\u2019t really believe that the creature would let him go so easily.\n\nIf people left the core area, they would return to the same spot that they had left. Unless they never entered the core area again, they\u2019d be trapped.\n\nBut Han Sen was different. Because he had four self-cogwheels, he could show up in four different locations. He didn\u2019t need to return to this location. If he could leave, he would be set free.\n\nThe small Crocodile God hurried him to leave and bring back wine. So, Han Sen generated the power to open the door to the core hall. He said to the small Crocodile God, \u201cI really am going.\u201d\n\nThe core hall\u2019s door was open, and the small Crocodile God made no effort to stop him. And neither did the big Crocodile God. For all intents and purposes, he had permission to leave.\n\nHan Sen was so happy. He hadn\u2019t thought that he would ever be able to leave that place so easily. So, he quickly hurried through the hall\u2019s door.\n\nThe small Crocodile God made no effort to stop him, and so Han Sen successfully managed to leave the core area. He returned to the safety of the white whale. His exit was so smooth that he could barely believe it.\n\n\u201cDad, you were gone for so long. Next time you go on such a long trip, can you take me with you?\u201d Bao\u2019er jumped into Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to that place.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t take people or creatures there, and even if he could, he wouldn\u2019t dare do it.\n\nIf a child entered the core area, they would have to be King class. And that meant people, upon seeing a small child enter, would go crazy.\n\nSeeing Bao\u2019er\u2019s smile, Han Sen\u2019s heart felt warm. He used Glasses to analyze Bao\u2019er\u2019s genes.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to find out how much potential Bao\u2019er had. He wanted to know what Bao\u2019er\u2019s race was. Bao\u2019er\u2019s race had always been a mystery, so maybe the glasses could help to resolve it once and for all.\n\nThe data scan of the glasses kept scrolling. A while went by, and the analysis cycled on and on. It gave Han Sen a bad feeling.\n\n\u201cLack of data\u2026 Cannot analyze\u2026 Cannot analyze\u2026\u201d When Han Sen heard those words, he was disappointed.\n\nBut no matter what race Bao\u2019er was, Han Sen didn\u2019t care. As far as he was concerned, she was his genuine daughter.\n\nHan Sen was going to let Glasses stop, but then he heard a voice. \u201cAnalysis complete. The genes are unstable. Gene level cannot be confirmed. Gene potential cannot be confirmed. You are her parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSh*t! This thing really is for kids. It isn\u2019t reliable,\u201d Han Sen thought in annoyance. After half a day of waiting, that was the result he got.\n\nHan Sen used Glasses to look at everyone on the white whale. Aside from Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, who came from the sanctuaries, the others were analyzed in great detail and with an impressive amount of accuracy.\n\nElysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng had the same results as Han Sen. Their genes were unstable, and they couldn\u2019t be analyzed.\n\nHan Sen tried using Glasses to analyze the little red bird. He didn\u2019t have much hope for success, but he was presented with something interesting.\n\nTarget: Phoenix (51%) and Fish-bird (49%) female\n\nGene class: Original Deified\n\nGene potential: 10 stars\n\nThere were many detailed pieces of information being analyzed, and it all shocked Han Sen. He hadn\u2019t expected the little red bird\u2019s blood to be that powerful. Its 10-star gene potential practically guaranteed that it would become a true god.\n\n\u201cHis gene blood is that strong?\u201d Han Sen curiously asked Glasses.\n\nGlasses answered, \u201cPhoenixes and fish-birds are true gods. It has the blood of both, and while its growth speed might be slow, there is a high chance it can become a true god. Its chances of failure are practically zero, but it will require a lot of materials to become a true god. It has a higher chance than a creature that is born purely a phoenix or a fish-bird.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen heard this, he closed his eyes in exhaustion for a long moment. He had been growing the little red bird all this time, and upon hearing this, he now knew he would have to gather a lot more resources for the bird in the future.\n\nHan Sen looked at the others in the white whale and assumed that the information on them was accurate. Then, he looked at Wan\u2019er who was asleep in Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nGlasses had to run longer for her than it did for the little red bird, but only one word was presented as a result: Sacred.\n\nThere was nothing more than that. It analyzed the race, but the only result was a name. There were no details or other content."
