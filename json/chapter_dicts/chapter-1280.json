When the blinding light dimmed, the statue\u2019s forehead was revealed to now contain a brand-new spirit stone. This one possessed the image of a snake.\n\n\u201cI thought this was a doll type beast soul. Hmm, so why did it just become a spirit stone?\u201d Han Sen was confused.\n\nAs he mulled the oddity, he noticed another image inside the spirit stone. It was hazy, like little more than a reflection, but its faint outline suggested the shape of a human.\n\n\u201cBlood River King?\u201d Han Sen was quickly given a shock, as the human image cleared to reveal it was actually Blood River King.\n\nIt was different, however, and it seemed to be a replica of the spirit that used to preside over the shelter. But it was a replica built from copper, and it had a texture that mirrored the Serpent Throne itself.\n\n\u201cMaster, I am Serpent Throne.\u201d The copper Blood River King appeared before Han Sen and knelt, as if in service.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t sure what to respond with, as this was all new to him.\n\n\u201cMaster, I am a copy of Blood River King\u2019s genes. I am his replica, a doll in his image and being. I possess his powers, to their full extent. I am him in every way, save mind,\u201d the Serpent Throne elucidated the curious happening.\n\nHan Sen asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ll look like this forever?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put me inside any statue. Do so, and I will reflect the image of the last spirit to occupy that shelter,\u201d Serpent Throne said.\n\nHan Sen was delighted. It was a powerful berserk super creature. This meant, even though it could make use of Blood River King\u2019s powers, the output would be greater than the original spirit\u2019s.\n\nAnd what\u2019s more, it was a beast soul. There was no danger or fear of betrayal; it would do Han Sen\u2019s bidding without question.\n\nHan Sen needed to take down Saint Fan\u2019s Shelter, and now he couldn\u2019t help but imagine the prospect of having a Saint Fan copycat bow before him.\n\n\u201cCan you resurrect like a spirit?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI am just a clone. Even after death, I can produce another copy of your chosen spirit, but it can take a while. That is the only restriction,\u201d Serpent Throne said.\n\n\u201cVery good.\u201d Han Sen escorted the doll to the battleground so he could test its strength.\n\nIt really did have Blood River King\u2019s powers, just at a greater level. For all intents and purposes, it was now a faster and stronger Blood River King.\n\nHan Sen was now dying to locate an emperor shelter he could take over, so he could have a copy of an emperor. The copy had no fixed power limit, and the power of the shelter was what dictated the power of the copy.\n\nHan Sen currently had Thunder Hell Shelter for an emperor shelter, but first, he wanted to try it out in his underground shelter. Han Sen was super duper curious who the last master of the underground shelter was.\n\nAlthough it was not able to copy the mind of the previous lord, he\u2019d at the very least like to get a good look at their appearance.\n\nHan Sen went to the underground shelter\u2019s spirit hall and summoned Serpent Throne. It entered the spirit stone\u2019s slot, like before. However, generating the doll took much longer this time.\n\nAfter a while, a copper light was cast into the hall right before Han Sen. The image was materializing.\n\nHan Sen examined the doll with great curiosity, as its image was completely different than Blood River King\u2019s. This new presence was quite astonishing.\n\nIt was a female spirit; one with horns and draconic wings. She had armor scaled like the hide of a dragon, and she looked like a Valkyrie.\n\n\u201cWho is this spirit?\u201d Han Sen asked, with his jaw agape.\n\n\u201cApologies, but I only copied the genes that form their person. Identities and former knowledge are impossible to replicate,\u201d Serpent Throne said.\n\n\u201cThen, how many gene locks do you have opened?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cTen,\u201d the Serpent Throne answered.\n\n\u201cThis really is an emperor-class shelter.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t very surprised. With the abilities the shelter possessed, it was difficult to believe it could have once been owned by anything less than an emperor. It was unique and special and far beyond any other shelter they had seen before.\n\nAfter this, he took the Valkyrie doll to the battlegrounds, keen for a showcase of her powers. He expected great things from an empress that once ruled his OG shelter in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nAfter entering and readying themselves, Han Sen expected to be greeted by a multitude of explosions and flashy lights. What actually transpired subverted his expectations, and all he could hear was a low rumble, accompanied by the formation of what could best be guessed to be a black hole.\n\nBut soon after, the head of a black dragon appeared out of the dark, swirling vortex. It came out of the fierce pit, roaring with its intimidating teeth on full display. Drops of saliva accompanied the visible exhaust of breath, which was, admittedly, not the sweetest smelling\u2026\n\nAnd then, the body and wings of this magnificent beast emerged. Valkyrie then leapt atop the glorious beast and rode it as if she was a Dragon Knight from an old storybook.\n\nStrangely, it didn\u2019t look as if she herself could fight, though. Instead, she just rode the beast, commanding it to attack in her stead. She had to be some sort of summoner or beastmaster; Han Sen imagined her to rely solely on the support of a creature in her command.\n\nThe black dragon\u2019s power was not too different than that of the fish, all in all, in terms of might and strength.\n\nWhile this wasn\u2019t what he expected, Han Sen was still happy with the results. All-in-all, this just meant Han Sen had acquired the service and powers of another emperor that had ten of its gene locks open.\n\n\u201cMaster, can you allow me to display to you the full extent of my might and strength? I believe it will be to your liking,\u201d the doll asked with a bubbly attitude, as if eager to impress her master.\n\n\u201cWait, you mean you can do something aside from summoning and riding a dragon?\u201d"
