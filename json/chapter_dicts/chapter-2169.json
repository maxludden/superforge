    "text": "\u201cKnife Queen is the Cold Palace Guardian. She has been summoned to the Extreme King. It is only expected that her student should take her place,\u201d Black Moon King responded evenly.\n\n\u201cOnly the best of the Rebate has been given the mantle of a Cold Palace Guardian. If Knife Queen is no longer able to do it, another King should be selected to replace her. A Marquise like Han Sen should be out of the question.\u201d Night River King looked at their boss, Moon Weel King. \u201cMister Moon Wheel, do you think we should select a King to replace Han Sen in Cold Palace?\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King quietly said, \u201cRight now, Knife is still in charge of its guardianship. It would be poor form to overrule her decision now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we? The guardian should be a King. Han Sen is just a Marquise. What if something happens? To safeguard the future of our entire race, no one of low rank should take that responsibility,\u201d Night River King said.\n\n\u201cThat does make sense,\u201d Shadow King said.\n\nFlower King did not say anything. He had receded into thought, and that was where he remained.\n\nBlack Moon King laughed coldly. \u201cNight River, you are in too much of a rush. Han Sen is temporarily filling in for Knife Queen. If you force a change now, and she returns, how will you explain the switch?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Night River. I am not scared of anyone. I only focus on what\u2019s best for the Rebate. Even if Knife was here right now, I\u2019d be trumpeting the same thing.\u201d Night River King boasted.\n\n\u201cReally? Then why did you not object when Knife first made the suggestion?\u201d Black Moon King bared his teeth in a grin. \u2018You really think Knife will never return from those chaotic systems? Is that why you are talking so boldly right now?\n\nDo not forget that there is every chance she will not be killed. If she returns, she will return deified. And if she returns deified and sees that you have again mistreated her student, you know what her fiery personality will spur her to do. You will be well and truly doomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only care about the matters themselves, not the people involved. Black Moon King, do not speak to me so condescendingly.\u201d Night River King continued to argue, but he sounded a lot weaker now.\n\n\u201cIf Han Sen is Knife\u2019s replacement, the least we can do is let him try. If he does a bad job, then one of you can swap with him. What do you think?\u201d Moon Wheel King looked at Flower King and the others.\n\nFlower King smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion. If Han Sen fails as a guardian, I\u2019m not letting it be my fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Shadow King said.\n\nBlack Moon King did not have an opinion, either.\n\nNight River King looked gloomy, but he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nTwo days after Yisha left, Han Sen arrived on Planet Blade. Snowbird Duke was in charge of the place with Yisha absent, and she had been instructed to serve him.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw Snowbird Duke, he was shocked. Snowbird Duke looked almost exactly like Icebird Duke, right down to her cold expression.\n\nIcebird Duke was still locked up in Purgatory Heaven where Han Sen had left her. He kept her there to prevent his identity from being leaked and to stop the secrets surrounding Purgatory Heaven from getting out. So, he had no choice but to leave her imprisoned.\n\nSeeing Snowbird Duke standing before him now was very strange.\n\nSnowbird Duke was very sensitive to such emotions, and she immediately noticed Han Sen\u2019s discomfiture. But she misunderstood what was making him uncomfortable. \u201cStop wondering. Icebird Duke is my little sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. That is why you two look so similar.\u201d Han Sen then went on to ask, \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never seen you before?\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore Knife Queen accepted you as a student, I was sent away for work. I returned only a little while ago, so of course we haven\u2019t met.\u201d Snowbird Duke didn\u2019t seem too interested in talking with Han Sen. She simply stood up and said, \u201cFollow me. Queen told me to escort you to Cold Palace.\u201d\n\nHan Sen, noticing her brusqueness, did not respond. He simply followed Snowbird Duke to the backdoor of Cold Palace.\n\n\u201cCold Palace is not in the palace?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Snowbird Duke answered emotionlessly.\n\nThe question had been rhetorical. Han Sen sighed and continued following Snowbird Duke until they reached a mountain behind the palace.\n\nHan Sen was wondering where Cold Palace was when Snowbird Duke stopped just short of the mountain slopes.\n\n\u201cThat is where you need to go. I do not have permission, so my guidance must stop here.\u201d Snowbird Duke pointed up the mountain to a waterfall. Nestled beside it was a small stone house. It looked to have been built from rocks, and it was surprisingly short, probably two meters tall at its highest point.\n\nLooking at the stone door, it seemed that Han Sen would have to bend double just to avoid bumping his head.\n\nThe old stone house made Han Sen confused, though. \u201cIs that Cold Palace?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought that this little shack surely couldn\u2019t be the palace he was supposed to guard, but there was a sign over the door frame that read Cold Palace.\n\n\u201cQueen said that you must come here on the first and fifteenth of the month to guard the entrance of Cold Palace. You must protect it for a whole twenty-four hours. Aside from those times, you may do whatever you please. But do not be tardy when you are expected to guard here.\u201d After that, Snowbird Duke turned and left.\n\nHan Sen had no choice but to hike up to the waterfall alone. The waterfall was pretty, and it was very wide. It felt as if an entire galaxy was descending from the space high above. The sound of surging water was deafeningly loud, but despite that, it carried the wonderful fragrance of trimmed grass.\n\nWhen he neared the stone house, however, Han Sen noticed the temperature drop. It didn\u2019t affect him, but it did seem fitting for the title of Cold Palace. It was a sharp contrast to the humidity and heat of the rest of Planet Blade.\n\nHan Sen looked at the stone house, but he did not see anything too strange about it. Aside from the lower temperature, it looked like a fairly ordinary house. It looked old and rarely-visited, but other than that, it was unremarkable.\n\n\u201cWhy was a stone house like this built here with not even a fence around it? What could it contain that\u2019s actually worth protecting?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nBut today was neither the first day nor the fifteenth, so there was no point in him being there. He looked back over the way he had come to memorize it, then turned to leave.\n\nBut just as Han Sen was about to walk back down the mountain, his heart jumped. His body tensed as he looked down the mountain path.\n\nSomeone was coming up that path, and while he seemed to be meandering along, the power he carried was like a tsunami. Every step he took felt intimidating. It felt like the ground was rumbling beneath him."
