Its head was peculiar, almost like a lionhead goldfish.\n\nAs it swam towards Han Sen, its tail wagged and fluttered behind it merrily.\n\nHe scanned the creature and could not detect the presence of a strong lifeforce. If he didn\u2019t know any better, it could have very well been an average fish.\n\nHan Sen backed away from it, but it followed him across the pool.\n\nAlthough he was wise to exercise caution, he knew the fish wasn\u2019t aggressive. If it had been, it would have bitten him already.\n\nThe goldfish swam behind Han Sen and circled the Phoenix Sword he was carrying on his back.\n\n\u201cThere is more to this goldfish than meets the eye. It is here, of all places, and in a pool formed by the tears of a phoenix. And what\u2019s more, it is showing interest in my Phoenix Sword. The feather of its composition might actually have belonged to one of those phoenix\u2019s, too.\u201d Han Sen had a lot to think about lately.\n\nThe lionhead-like fish continued to swim around and around the sword with keen interest.\n\nHan Sen decided to tap the goldfish with his finger to see how it would respond. His finger prodded the creature, but it didn\u2019t pay any mind. It continued to circle the sword, showing no fear at his presence or attention.\n\nHan Sen decided to grab the whole goldfish and see if he could detect a lifeforce by bringing it out the water. He did this, but could not detect anything. Queer behavior aside, it really did seem like an ordinary goldfish.\n\n\u201cCan a run-of-the-mill goldfish really live in a place like this?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nBao\u2019er decided to jump back into the water and swam over to Han Sen with haste. She had seen the goldfish in Han Sen\u2019s hand, and she wanted to touch it herself.\n\nWatching the playful baby approach, the fish wriggled its way out of Han Sen\u2019s hand, hopped back into the water, and swam behind him for cover.\n\nBao\u2019er looked angry after seeing its behavior, and so she tried to swim around and grab it. Fortunately for the fish, Han Sen stopped her.\n\n\u201cGo play someplace else.\u201d Han Sen pushed Bao\u2019er away.\n\nThe fish was an interesting little thing, and so Han Sen didn\u2019t want her to kill it. If there was a benefit or purpose to this fish, he\u2019d rather discover what it was before it died. A needless death would be a waste.\n\nBao\u2019er gave a stern look to the goldfish and then swam away.\n\nHan Sen scooped the fish back up in his hand to give it another look. He couldn\u2019t espy anything special about it, and he didn\u2019t think it was a sacred-blood creature in disguise, either.\n\nBut appearances were often misleading, so Han Sen\u2019s wasn\u2019t so quick to believe it was just an average goldfish.\n\nHan Sen placed the fish down just outside the pool. In a weird display, the fish did not simply flop around like he suspected it would. Instead, it transformed into a little red bird.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide, for this was the first time he had seen something like this. It most certainly caught him off-guard.\n\nHan Sen picked up the bird and returned it to the water. When submerged, it transformed into a fish again.\n\n\u201cWow, that is very weird.\u201d Han Sen watched in disbelief as the lionhead goldfish-bird-thing returned to swim around his sword.\n\nHan Sen turned to look at Xie Qing King and noticed his eyes were still closed. It seemed as if he was still unaware of what was going on.\n\nHan Sen decided to take the goldfish back out of the water. Like before, it transformed into a bird. But strangely, it did not fly. He suspected that the bird was too plump for proper flight, as all it did was take a strong hop up onto his shoulder. When there, it pecked the Phoenix Sword on his back.\n\n\u201cThis thing must be special. I wonder if I can bring it with me?\u201d A streak of greed flashed across Han Sen\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe bird seemed resistant this time, as if it did not want to leave the shoulder nearest his sword.\n\nRemaining in the pool for seven hours would take a long time, and while he did not mind waiting, he didn\u2019t want Xie Qing King to find out about the goldfish-bird he had discovered.\n\nBut suddenly, a sharp cry echoed across the sky.\n\nHan Sen raised his head in response, and when looking up, he saw a raven circling the skies above them.\n\n\u201cSo noisy,\u201d Xie Qing King said, before the raven exploded in a messy puff of feathers. A weird spectacle, considering the spirit did not even move.\n\nHan Sen thought that would be it, but more ravens came.\n\nThe bodies of these ravens were on fire.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Dongxuan Aura had mostly recovered by now, and he was able to feel them approach before they actually did.\n\nHe could also tell that these ravens were mostly mutant class, but were stronger than the sheep he had encountered earlier. Furthermore, there were at least a thousand of these black, fiery birds.\n\nXie Qing King looked annoyed by the raucous cawing of the ravens that had suddenly appeared overhead. He stepped out of the lake and flew up into the skies in a rage to begin murdering the murder.\n\nHe pummeled them into oblivion, and blood and feathers rained down around him.\n\nThe strange situation only became stranger. When the blood and feathers reached the water, an invisible force pushed the mess away, to avoid polluting the place. Nothing spoiled the tears of the lake.\n\nHan Sen donned his armor and flew up as well, to aid Xie Qing King in killing the birds.\n\nAs he had expected, the announcement confirmed that they were indeed mutant creatures. Their official name was \u201cFire Raven,\u201d and like the other creatures he had killed in this weird location, they were inedible.\n\nHan Sen suddenly heard the cry of another raven. This screech was different from the others he had heard, so he looked around to see which bird had made the noise. And when he turned around, the sky was ablaze with a fierce red fire."
