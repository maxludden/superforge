    "text": "Stay Up Late looked at the officer sadly. Without moving an inch, he said, \u201cOfficer, it was you who taught me to never fall back. It was you who taught me to always do my job. I will never forget that\u201d\n\nThe officer moved his eyes and then stopped. He responded by saying, \u201cIf you must be like this, then excuse my cruel deeds.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the officer swung his white metal sword. But before Stay Up Late could see how it moved, he groaned in pain. He now had a wound on his chest that was deep enough to reveal his ribs.\n\n\u201cThat was a warning strike,\u201d the officer said to Stay Up Late.\n\nStay Up Late looked at the white metal sword and said, \u201cThe Western King Sword and the Southern King Wings are so powerful. No wonder they are legendary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only used 10% of my power!\u201d the officer said.\n\nStay Up Late looked down on the wound on his chest and calmly said, \u201cNext time you strike, and I don\u2019t dodge, please just leave my body here. A special ops operative that doesn\u2019t complete their mission should not return home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you so stubborn?\u201d The officer sounded a bit angry.\n\n\u201cThese are my principles. You taught them to me!\u201d Stay Up Late said.\n\n\u201cGood. I will teach you another lesson, then. You need to think on the fly,\u201d the officer said and moved his Western King Sword again. He did so faster than last time.\n\nBut this time, Stay Up Late moved. It was like he moved with the Western King Sword, except he was a little ahead of it.\n\nStay Up Late grunted, and another wound appeared on his body. This wound was lighter than the last, however, and the damage wasn\u2019t so grievous.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you can teach an old dog a new trick.\u201d The officer frowned. The sword had not performed as impressively as he had expected, especially after he put even more strength into the second swing.\n\nStay Up Late laughed and said, \u201cI learned that from Han Sen. Humans are weaker, and their lifespans are shorter, but their creativity far exceeds ours. The skills they create are far more ingenious than what the crystallizers developed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are falling!\u201d the officer grunted. He waved his fire wings and swung his Western King Sword.\n\nStay Up Late\u2019s movements were similar to Han Sen\u2019s, but not exactly on the mark. He was borrowing some techniques and skills, but he was adding them to his own. He was still using mostly his own talents.\n\nStay Up Late dodged the deadly attack, but he was too weak to escape it all. His body was wounded again. He was beginning to look like a bloodman.\n\nThe officer, with armor from two crystallizer kings, was faster and stronger than Stay Up Late.\n\nSeeing Gugia get killed by Golden Growler, the officer had lost all his patience. He waved his Western King Sword and prepared to unleash all his power.\n\nStay Up Late had managed to avoid getting killed by the previous three strikes, but he had still been hit by each. With the wounds incurred, he wouldn\u2019t be able to evade the fourth. The sword was on its way, arcing down towards his chest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d Stay Up Late sighed. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it, and he knew his body would be cut in half.\n\nBoom!\n\nSuddenly, a light came from the sky. It hit the Western King Sword with the power of a small sun. It shocked the officer and his sword, and the sword missed its target, buying Stay Up Late time.\n\nStay Up Late\u2019s body moved fast, and he avoided the strike. He looked to the sky in shock.\n\nThe officer\u2019s face changed and he looked up, too. There was a shadow up there, moving quick. And there was a light coming down on the officer.\n\nThe officer kept swinging his Western King Sword to try and break the light, but he then saw a giant beetle land.\n\nHan Sen had finally come back to Roca, and he saw Stay Up Late was going to get killed. He used the unicorn beetle\u2019s weapon systems to save him.\n\nSeeing the person use a sword to break the beetle\u2019s light, Han Sen was shocked. The beetle\u2019s light was not as good as geno armor because the mobility wasn\u2019t up to scratch.\n\nThe officer saw someone appear, and he didn\u2019t want to waste any more time with the unexpected. So, he had to finish his task before Zagu was killed.\n\nHe flapped his wings and teleported to the beetle. He slashed towards the beetle and cut a three-meter-long crevice through it.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, so he quickly recalled the beetle. The unicorn beetle could not move fast to evade attacks. He was afraid it could very easily be destroyed if that continued.\n\n\u201cHan Sen!\u201d The officer was shocked when he saw Han Sen emerge from the machine. He used his Western King Sword against him, trying to slash him like he had never slashed before.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face changed and he tried to dodge, but his fitness could not save him from those swipes.\n\nBefore he could move, the glove on his right hand became an armorset that shielded his entire body. Then, the fist aligned itself with the arc of the Western King Sword.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe fist hit the sword, and it created an explosion in the sky. It was far worse than the detonation of an atom bomb. The impact turned the ground into an ocean. The city became a ruin.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s body fell back a few thousand meters. He was rather shocked that he didn\u2019t fall over.\n\nHe knew the immense power of the glove, but even so, he was still sent flying. His chest fell awful, but his opponent hadn\u2019t moved an inch. That was a testament to the sheer power he wielded.\n\nHan Sen did not know Western King Sword, Southern King Wings, and the glove were all on the same level. The officer was simply stronger than Han Sen, which made the glove appear weaker.\n\n\u201cNorthern King Glove. I did not expect one of the four crystallizer kings\u2019 armors could be found here. Let me take the Northern King Glove and the Eastern King Crystal Shoes, then I can get moving.\u201d The officer looked excited, staring down at Han Sen in the jade armor.\n\nHe flapped his wings alongside his sword. The officer looked completely murderous, and he wanted to kill Han Sen for the glove.\n\nHan Sen used The Story of Genes and let his energy combine with the armor to assimilate with it."
