    "text": "At almost the exact same time the announcement played, Han Sen heard an angry shout saying, \u201cStop it!\u201d\n\nHan Sen suddenly saw a murderous beast, which looked completely red, roar in the sky, which was very dark and burning red. It was heading toward Han Sen and looked murderous. It spat some red light out at him. The red light was not a flame. It was like a laser. It suddenly doused Han Sen in red light.\n\n\u201cRed Ghost, you are still alive\u2026\u201d Nine Thousand King screamed with shock. In the next second, he flashed in front of Han Sen. The eyes on his green armor opened. He released a green light that fought against the red light. He kept fighting Red Ghost\u2019s red light while screaming, \u201cRed Ghost, do not hurt Mister Han!\u201d\n\nRed Ghost looked at Nine Thousand King and coldly asked, \u201cWho is this? Is it you, the servant Thousand Eye? Did you, servant, not die but found a new master?\u201d His tone of voice was riddled with disdain.\n\n\u201cShut up! The master asked me to protect Mister Han. Do not dare try anything.\u201d Nine Thousand King spoke angrily, but people could tell he was afraid of Red Ghost. He did not dare attack it.\n\nRed Ghost laughed dimly. \u201cThousand Eye, don\u2019t do anything here. How old is he? When the master was here, his great-grandad\u2019s grandad was not even born yet. Did you say the leader asked you to protect him? Pah. You are talking way too much crap.\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King wanted to explain, but Red Ghost kept madly shouting. Some metallic sounds were heard that rumbled like thunder. The red light turned into darkness. The Red Ghost angrily looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cStop talking crap. I do not care if you have found a new master, you old servant. Have your master hand over the holy spirit. Otherwise, you and your new master can die together.\u201d\n\nAfter that, a red light emerged from its mouth. It tried coming for Han Sen, but Nine Thousand King stood before it.\n\n\u201cRed Ghost, do you really think I am going to be afraid of you?\u201d Nine Thousand King gnashed his teeth and did not stand down. His body flickered with a green light. The angry ghost shadow appeared. He used One Second Is a Thousand Years.\n\nWhen he used One Second Is a Thousand Years, Nine Thousand King barely managed to block the red light.\n\n\u201cOne second is a thousand years, and one thousand years is a second,\u201d Red Ghost said. \u201cAre you willing to use that many years of your lifespan for this moment? Let\u2019s see how long you can last.\u201d Its mouth was still full of red light as it kept attacking Nine Thousand King.\n\nNine Thousand King\u2019s body\u2019s green light had the buffs imparted by One Second Is a Thousand Years. Through it, he managed to stop the red light\u2019s attack. His face kept getting older, and his hair kept getting whiter.\n\nNine Thousand King kept blocking the red light as he shouted, \u201cYou should leave, Mister Han!\u201d\n\nHan Sen was surprised. He did not expect Nine Thousand King would go to such lengths to protect him. It did not look like he was just pretending either.\n\nHe wanted to say something, but he saw something coming over from out of the dark clouds. It was circling them. It evilly asked, \u201cGo? Go where? If you do not leave the holy spirit behind, you will all be killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFish Bird? You are still alive!\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s face looked even more horrid.\n\n\u201cIt is not us those who are alive.\u201d A very cold female voice sounded from the black. A very attractive woman came forward out of the darkness.\n\nOn the other end, an eyeless beast crawled out. The four scary-looking creatures blocked the bright lanterns around. They blocked Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others, who were on the verge of leaving.\n\n\u201cNo Eye\u2026 Demon Girl\u2026 You guys are still here\u2026\u201d Nine Thousand King was shocked. He looked at the four creatures.\n\n\u201cYes, we are here, and we are in charge of maintaining the holy palace. The holy palace is still here. How can we die?\u201d The demon girl rolled her eyes. She looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cYou are a servant, yet you are also still alive. It looks like you have a new master too. That is surprising.\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King kept blocking Red Ghost\u2019s red light while shouting, \u201cI have not betrayed the master! The master asked me to protect Mister Han.\u201d\n\nOld Vulture coldly asked from the air, \u201cHow can you still be so stubborn? I will kill you, the servant, first. Then, I will deal with the kid that dared to steal our holy spirit.\u201d It quickly spat out some black smoke.\n\nThe black smoke was not very strong, but it was weird. It was like a black, toxic snake heading straight for Nine Thousand King.\n\nNine Thousand King tried his hardest to block Red Ghost\u2019s attacks. He did not have spare power to fend off the black smoke too. He looked scared, but he still did his best to block it.\n\nSuddenly, Nine Thousand King felt as if his shoulders had been pulled back by a certain power. He dodged the black smoke and left the red light\u2019s attacks.\n\nHe turned his head. Nine Thousand King saw that Han Sen was in front of him. The red light and black smoke were headed for Han Sen.\n\n\u201cCareful, Mister!\u201d Nine Thousand King was shocked. He wanted to go up and help Han Sen block it, but he felt as if space around had some weird changes. The red light and black smoke started to strangely slow down. They could not get close to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTime Ghost\u2019s Time Area!\u201d Red Ghost and Fish Bird sighed with shock. They put away their powers and stopped attacking.\n\n\u201cTime Area is not that good,\u201d Fish Bird coldly grunted. It wanted to flap its wings and go straight for Han Sen.\n\n\u201cOld Vulture, stop it,\u201d Auntie Mei, the demon girl, said. She stopped Old Vulture from proceeding.\n\nOld Vulture rolled its weird eyes and asked Auntie Mei, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet rid of these others who are disturbing us, and then we will get rid of him,\u201d Auntie Mei coldly said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Old Vulture rolled its weird eyes. It flapped his wings and spat out black smoke. It was going toward Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the other three Extreme King deifieds.\n\nThe big eyeless beast on the other side was moving its giant body. It rolled toward Sky Palace\u2019s first seat.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster\u2019s body rose like a cloud, but he was unable to block Old Vulture\u2019s black smoke. He kept falling back while shouting, \u201cStop it! I have something to say!\u201d\n\nThe three Extreme King deified elite were not as strong as Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. The power inside their bodies was shattered by the black smoke. It was like they had lost their souls as they dropped to the floor.\n\n\u201cIf you have something to say, say it in hell after you have died,\u201d Old Vulture spookily said. It flapped its wings and flew toward Ancient Abyss.\n\nThe big eyeless beast was like a rolling knife going toward Sky Palace\u2019s first seat. He saw Sky Palace\u2019s first seat clap his hands. The direction in which the big eyeless beast was rolling changed. It turned 180 degrees and rolled into the dark.\n\n\u201cMy Name is Sky Palace\u2019s First Seat Elder. We are not here to offend anyone. Can you please hear us out?\u201d Sky Palace\u2019s first seat was very strong but did not dare say something reckless there. He was being polite.\n\nNo one cared about him. The eyeless big beast emerged from the dark again. It was headed for Sky Palace\u2019s first seat."
