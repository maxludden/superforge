    "text": "Han Sen held an orb that was around the same size as a man\u2019s fist. It shone like a miniature sun. If you looked at it closely, you could see there was something gold swimming inside it.\n\nDeified Beast Soul: Sun Raven (Gem Type)\n\nAs he fiddled with the orb, he considered it.\n\nHan Sen had obtained a few gem type beast souls in the past. Not many of them existed, as they were quite rare. But they could be used to bring other beast souls up to the same level as the gem beast soul.\n\nThis was a deified gem type beast soul, and that meant all Han Sen would have to do was find another beast soul of a compatible element. If he did, he could bring it up to a deified class.\n\nHan Sen had a few different beast souls, but nothing like a firebird beast soul. That meant he could not use the deified gem type beast soul at this point in time. Han Sen returned it to his Sea of Soul, and then he looked at the ledger for the base.\n\nThe base\u2019s shortage of manpower kept them from producing much, but something very nice did happen soon after the crisis was averted. A young woman with ordinary geno armor had a second evolution. She became a Baron.\n\nGu Qingcheng guessed it might have had something to do with the gold raven mark. Perhaps the energy that melted into their bodies was what prompted the second evolution.\n\nThe geno armament she received was a fire type.\n\n\u201cIf the gold raven mark can make people evolve, does that mean all these women and kids could end up becoming xenogeneics or Nobles?\u201d As Han Sen mulled that thought over, he realized he was quite happy about it.\n\nAny Nobles he developed could become Han Sen\u2019s loyal army, and he could be more confident about using them.\n\nOf course, it still depended on when they could all become Nobles.\n\nOnly Black Steel and Captain Wood knew of the events that occurred in the Raven palace. It had been many days since then, and yet word had not gotten out. The news had been suppressed by all survivors, it seemed.\n\nIt did not matter much, anyway, even if word was to get out.\n\nThere were fewer Nobles in the base right now, at least, and that made things easier for him to manage. This also provided Han Sen with more time to practice and hunt xenogeneics. Even so, he was still unable to level up and become a Viscount.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, how are your skills coming along?\u201d When Yisha finished practicing, she finally called up Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThings are going swimmingly,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\nYisha, upon hearing Han Sen say that, smiled. Icebird was behind her, but she hadn\u2019t said a word.\n\nBecause Yisha had told her to review Han Sen\u2019s current situation, she knew he had lost many Barons and Viscounts. He always hunted alone, and he didn\u2019t focus on his practice.\n\n\u201cGood. The Moon God Festival is coming. All the elites and their heirs will be going. You should think about joining us. There\u2019ll be a test,\u201d Yisha said coldly.\n\n\u201cMoon God Festival?\u201d Han Sen looked at Yisha with a modicum of confusion.\n\nYisha signaled for Icebird to step forward and explain. \u201cThe Moon God Festival happens every forty-nine years. Only the Rebate who are born within those forty-nine years are able to join. Because there are many outsiders within the Rebate society, especially over the past few centuries, they are also allowed to join. That is, if they are able to qualify.\u201d\n\nIcebird explained it to Han Sen, so he\u2019d know a bit more about it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t random that it happened every forty-nine years. Every forty-nine years, on the main eleven planets, a moon altar would appear. Creatures that were born within those forty-nine years could enter the altar to Moon Palace.\n\nThe Moon Palace was in the center of Narrow-Moon, but it was different from the Gold Raven Hall. There was no sun. There were just the planets and Moon God Palace. It was usually cold, and hidden in the dark. Not even deified elites could sneak in.\n\nDuring this time, the planet would appear, and the Moon God Palace would open up. Anyone who could make it past the altar and reach the palace would be blessed by the Moon God. This was a big thing for the Rebate, and the event would even be livestreamed. The first person to be blessed would receive a big reward from the Rebate.\n\nNo one knew what the reward would be, though; it was something that was decided by the elder, and the elder hadn\u2019t announced what the reward was going to be yet.\n\nBut Han Sen was more interested in the blessing than the physical reward. The Moon God might have been present, but there were no statues or creatures around the palace. The creatures that entered Moon God Palace looked awfully cold. The blessing was to be bathed in moonlight, it was said, and no actual god showed itself.\n\nThere was no advantage to going to Moon God Palace early. Once the palace opened, you could be blessed at any point until the palace closed again. The amount of blessing you\u2019d receive was random, and didn\u2019t depend on timing either.\n\nSometimes, the last person to go would receive the most blessings. Sometimes the earlier arrivals would receive the greatest blessing. There didn\u2019t appear to be a reliable rule for how the blessings were distributed.\n\nAfter many Moon God Festivals, it was deduced that the strength of the blessing depended on the person.\n\nNormally, the actual Rebate received the strongest blessings. Outsiders rarely ever had a chance to join in, and there was a fairly obvious bias.\n\nYisha let Han Sen go, but Han Sen didn\u2019t think he\u2019d receive much of a blessing. She just wanted him to witness the new elites that showed up every forty-nine years. In the festival, showing off your power was far more important than earning first place. Aside from receiving a bonus from the elders, you\u2019d receive nothing special.\n\nMost Rebate and xenogeneics just wanted to use the festival to gain fame. Han Sen was Queen\u2019s only student, and he would definitely be challenged. That was why she mentioned there would be a test for him.\n\nForty-nine years was not a short amount of time, and there were a few Viscounts that had joined. An Earl had taken part, as well. Ordinarily, they wouldn\u2019t kill anyone. But even so, Han Sen was a Baron, and it was difficult to say if he\u2019d pull through.\n\nAfter they ended the call, Icebird said, \u201cWhat if too many people realize that you are letting him join? You taking him as a student has soured many of the younger ones. I am afraid they will try to teach him a lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good for the young ones to suffer failure.\u201d Yisha smiled."
