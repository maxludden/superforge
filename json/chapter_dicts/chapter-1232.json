It was different from normal lightning, and the end of the bolt seemed to be stemming from something solid. It was a blue stone.\n\nThe blue stone was like crystal, and he could see lightning inside and out of it.\n\nThe lightning was strange, though. Each flash only illuminated a small portion of the area around the stone. Outside of its immediate proximity was darkness and nothing more. If Han Sen had not been led as close as he was now, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it out in that stifling darkness.\n\nWater Fairy had generated a bubble for Han Sen to sit within, so he could breathe and talk underwater.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Han Sen asked as he pointed towards the lightning stone.\n\nThe lightning stone was very large, around the size of a house. Curiously, there were many holes in its exterior that could provide Han Sen access.\n\nWater Fairy entered the bubble and took Han Sen\u2019s arm, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is, but it sure seems to be brimming with power, don\u2019t you think? Be careful going close, though, as the holes occasionally beam with the lightning. It won\u2019t leave the confines of the crystal as long as its undisturbed, thankfully. You most probably heard the sound of thunder outside, did you not? It was that. Like an explosive exhaust of lightning and thunder.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me how to trigger the lightshow,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nWater Fairy nodded and waved her hand, then a wave of water went towards the stone.\n\nWhen her water touched the stone, blue lightning spat out from its holes. The lightning lashed out like hungry vines, which then wrapped around the exterior of the stone and produced a thunderous roar.\n\nWhen the water came into contact with the lightning, the wave was broken.\n\nWhen the water was gone, the lightning began to calm and go back to its simmering status as if nothing had transpired.\n\nHan Sen looked at the stone with a hearty mixture of surprise and fervent inquisitiveness. It was strong, but it did not show signs of possessing a lifeforce. The lightning seemed to be genuine.\n\nIf it was just lightning, though, why would it have the awareness to prevent something from approaching?\n\n\u201cYou said the water wouldn\u2019t allow the presence of dirt, so how is this stone here in the water?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nWater Fairy frowned and said, \u201cNormally, Sky Pure Water cannot contain dirt. And if an item that is unclean is present, the Sky Pure Water displaces both the unclean item and the water surrounding the item. It really is strange, even to me, that this lightning stone is here in the midst of the water.\u201d\n\nHan Sen observed the stone a bit more and then told her, \u201cTake me closer.\u201d\n\nWater Fairy responded to this with shock, and she quickly exclaimed, \u201cBut that lightning is so strong, I don\u2019t think we can withstand it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI only want to get a closer peek, that\u2019s it. Take me there, and if I can\u2019t withstand it, then you can pull me back.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d Water Fairy said with renewed confidence. She looked happy, and then she took the bubble closer to the danger zone.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to simulate Thunder Hell Emperor\u2019s black lightning, wanting to see if he could get right into the stone.\n\nThere could be a treasure inside, one that belonged to Thunder Hell. If that was the case, Han Sen thought the lightning would only acknowledge the presence of the now-deceased spirit, and a simulation of his power would be the next best thing.\n\nWhen the bubble got closer, though, the stone began to spew blue lightning to seal off each point of entry possible.\n\nThe bubble connected with one whip of lightning and immediately broke. In response, Han Sen turned and struck the blue lightning with the black lightning he now commanded.\n\nPang!\n\nThe reaction was not what Han Sen expected, and he was literally shocked. The electricity that coursed through him was excruciatingly painful, and it sent him flying backward. Fortunately, Water Fairy managed to catch him with another bubble. If she hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have been blasted back out of the well.\n\nHan Sen looked at his hand, noticing the presence of blue lightning flickering across it. The black lightning was no match, it seemed.\n\n\u201cStrange. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any association between the blue and black lightning. Was it just my simulation that failed? Did the stone fail to recognize me as Thunder Hell?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHis hand still jolted with the presence of lightning that was still there, and every time it sparked, a new mark was left. It started to make Han Sen feel numb.\n\nOpting to try something else, Han Sen decided to simulate the silver fox\u2019s lightning. He was intrigued by the stone, and he really wanted to get rid of the blue lightning that was inhibiting his examinations and possible treasure collection.\n\nAnd with the silver lightning, the breakthrough he was looking for was achieved. The blue lightning moved away from Han Sen. It seemed as if the cords of blue were afraid of the silver lightning that Han Sen had created.\n\n\u201cMaster, the blue lightning is retreating! It is returning back to the stone, as if it is afraid of something,\u201d Water Fairy said,\n\n\u201cTake me back to the hole again.\u201d Han Sen hadn\u2019t expected the silver fox\u2019s abilities to have such far-reaching positive effects.\n\nHan Sen did notice that Thunder Hell\u2019s lightning was different than the silver fox\u2019s. Thunder Hell\u2019s lightning was all about pure destruction and the taking of lives; the silver fox was about saving lives instead. It could be used to heal others, after all.\n\nThe blue lightning was afraid of Little Silver\u2019s lightning, or at least, that was what Han Sen guessed.\n\nWater Fairy delivered him to the stone as he had requested, and when Han Sen reached it, the hole had already begun building up a discharge to lash and keep him away. In response, Han Sen summoned his silver lightning again, which made the blue lightning retreat.\n\nHan Sen was delighted, and this really was the result he was looking for. He told Water Fairy to wait where she was, while he jumped into the hole that the silver lightning had opened."
