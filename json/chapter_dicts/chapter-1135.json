Old Han carried that thing around with him, just as you do. Knowing your great-grandfather was Han Jinzhi, I went to learn as much about you as I could. Memories of yore kept me staring at it, I suppose. I didn\u2019t mean nothing by it, and I didn\u2019t suspect you\u2019d find out from the occasional gaze.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not say anything, as he wanted the man to continue talking.\n\nUncle Bug sighed and said, \u201cThe reason why I know it is there, truthfully, is because I can feel its existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can feel its existence?\u201d Han Sen looked rather confused. The Nine-Life Cat pendant did not exude any particular force. The only remotely remarkable thing it had done was reacting when Han Sen began learning the Blood-Pulse Sutra.\n\nHan Sen could only assume that Uncle Bug\u2019s ability to feel the existence of this pendant was because he was a member of Blood Legion. There didn\u2019t seem to be another likely alternative.\n\nBut all Uncle Bug had said about his past was that he was an Interstellar Pirate. He had made no mention of an association to Blood Legion.\n\nUncle Bug then pointed towards Han Sen\u2019s chest and asked, \u201cCan I take a look?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was a little dubious about whether he should show it to the man, but he did so anyway.\n\nUncle Bug gently took hold of the pendant, and his eyes fluttered as if he was in remembering something far in the past. He said, \u201cThis necklace\u2026 it was found in an old ruin. I\u2019m the one who gave it to Old Han, you know.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was delivered another shocking revelation. He had always believed the pendant to be a relic of Blood Legion, and that Han Jinzhi had been a member.\n\nWhat Uncle Bug had told Han Sen surprised him a great deal.\n\nRecalling those past memories, Uncle Bug looked painfully nostalgic. He said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t gained any fame at that point, but I did have a modicum of infamy. I was once a thief, after all. Old Han invited me to poke about and explore an old ruin. It was an experience that changed my life. That is where I found the Qi Gong I mentioned. The Qi Gong and the pendant were both found there.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug then smiled and said, \u201cThe Nine-Life Cat and Qi Gong were together, but we became separated at one point. When I found the items, I kept the Qi Gong for myself and only gave the Nine-Life Cat to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was because of that Qi Gong I became stronger. I became a renowned pirate because of it.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug gave back the pendant to Han Sen and he said, \u201cThe Qi Gong has some association to that pendant, in some way or another. If it isn\u2019t too far away, I can feel it.\u201d\n\nHan Sen put the pendant around his neck again and asked, \u201cAnd what about the ruins? What was so remarkable about them? Did he only go there for the pendant?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a city that had been buried beneath a mountain. Perhaps it was a city from ancient times. I think the reason Old Han went there was for the pendant exclusively, as he made explicit mention of it. Just the pendant, too. He said he had to bring it back with him or something,\u201d Uncle Bug further explained.\n\nHan Sen frowned. Uncle Bug\u2019s answers were disappointing, as he had not yet elucidated the relationship between Han Jinzhi and the Nine-Life Cat.\n\n\u201cBy the way, there is one more thing I must ask. Why did you think it was impossible for Han Jinzhi to have an heir?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMany people had found it difficult to believe Han Jinzhi had an heir for some reason, so Han Sen was eager to find out.\n\nIn that era, infertility wasn\u2019t an issue. The technology to create babies existed, even if it was only done through the artificial combination of two people\u2019s genes. It was extremely rare for someone to be unable to create a baby.\n\nIf people were so sure Han Jinzhi could not make a baby, he had to have some sort of problem.\n\nHan Sen wanted to know why, to ensure he really was an heir to Han Jinzhi.\n\nUncle Bug gave a wry smile, saying, \u201cI am telling you for sure: you are not Old Han\u2019s heir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen needed a firm reason to believe this claim.\n\nUncle Bug said, \u201cThat was once a secret. But since he is gone, maybe now I really can tell you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen perked his ears up, eager for the answer he had been awaiting for so long.\n\nStrangely, Uncle Bug ended up asking, \u201cAre you a human?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was immediately taken aback in confusion. He exclaimed, \u201cOf course I am human!\u201d\n\nUncle Bug responded, \u201cThat is right. You are a human; he was not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what was he? A shura?\u201d Han Sen was shocked, and he did not expect that answer.\n\nIt was then that Han Sen remembered Han Jinzhi was said to be the last human with a master Qi Gong, and he was a commander of the Blueblood Special Forces. But if he was a shura, how could he be allowed such a position?\n\nHan Sen stared at Uncle Bug, wanting even more answers.\n\nBut to this, Uncle Bug shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what his race was, but he was certain when he told me himself: he was not human.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must have been something to differentiate him from other humans. Did he have a horn or something?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cHe walked, talked, and looked like a human, but his blood was blue,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\n\u201cHe was a commander of Blueblood Special Forces and he had blue blood. Is that a coincidence?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nUncle Bug then provided Han Sen with a scroll, and he said, \u201cThis is the Qi Gong I took. It is pointless for me to have this now, so take a look for yourself. If you\u2019re interested, take it with you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen accepted the scroll and thanked him. They then went on to chat about other things, but they weren\u2019t of importance."
