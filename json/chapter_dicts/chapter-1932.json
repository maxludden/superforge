    "text": "Everyone looked towards the cup that the Viscount was holding. They heard a cracking sound, then the cup shattered. The pieces and the water splashed down to the table.\n\nRebecca and the others saw it shatter, and then their eyes widened. Amidst the broken shards of ceramic, there was a moon-like thing. It was still floating where the cup had been.\n\nDu Lishe was simply frozen, and could not speak.\n\nRebecca\u2019s face changed, and she asked the Viscount, \u201cDid Han Sen really use that teacup?\u201d\n\nThe Viscount said, \u201cYes, I was sitting next to him. I saw everything he did, and that cup has not been touched since.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he has been gone for half an hour. How can the Moon still be there, and how could it have broken the cup? That surely isn\u2019t Moon.\u201d Kriman looked at the sisters with confusion.\n\nThe reflection in the water was the beginning of Moon. Putting light in the water wasn\u2019t something that was supposed to last, as it didn\u2019t physically exist. It would fade away quickly without a source of power to keep pumping into it.\n\nHan Sen had been gone for half an hour, and the shape in the water still remained. That meant it wasn\u2019t just an illusion. The light was something solid. It had broken the cup, which no illusion could do.\n\nRebecca stood up and walked over to Han Sen\u2019s seat. She looked at the light, examining it with a strange expression.\n\nThe others came over to surround it, too. Kriman said, \u201cRebecca, is this Moon? That guy isn\u2019t playing a trick on us, is he?\u201d\n\nRebecca looked down at the bright moon and said, \u201cIt is. And it is much better than what Du Lishe and I can do. It has the secrets of Moon Wheel in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe secrets of Moon Wheel?\u201d Everyone was shocked.\n\nWhen Rebecca mentioned Moon Wheel, it got everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nRebecca pointed at the light and said, \u201cDo you see? This is a solid light. This isn\u2019t just a mere shadow. This is not a reflection. It is a real moon. But it should be impossible for a solid moon to enter the water without at least causing ripples. Everything that touches water should deform it, unless you had the extremely gentle touch of something like Moon Wheel.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebecca, you and Du Lishe can do something like this, yes?\u201d Sad Night asked Rebecca.\n\nRebecca shook her head, \u201cMy Father practiced Moon Wheel to a half-deified status. This skill stems from Moonlight, so it is easy to learn, but difficult to practice. Not everyone can bring it up to its highest tier. Du Lishe hasn\u2019t practiced Moon Wheel at all. I have practiced it, but I am far from gentle enough to do this. You would have to be a Duke or a King to avoid disturbing the water.\u201d\n\nEveryone\u2019s faces changed. Kriman\u2019s face looked particularly bad, and he asked, \u201cIs it really that hard? Han Sen did not practice Moon Wheel, and he is just a Viscount that practiced Moon. How could he do such a thing? Look closer. He might have tried to trick us or something.\u201d\n\nRebecca peered into the light for a while, before giving up with a wry smile. \u201cThis is Moon, yes. I don\u2019t know how he managed to do this. I have only seen a casting of such quality from my father. Maybe he really did leam something from the Narrow Moon Knife.\u201d\n\nWhen everyone heard that, they were struck with speechlessness. Kriman\u2019s face was twitching, and it burned.\n\nDu Lishe blushed. She had been so cocky about her generation of three moons, but now, she realized her performance wasn\u2019t anywhere near the same level.\n\n\u201cHow can such a genius exist here in this universe? By just looking at a knife and hoping to learn a geno art? This is something most people might never accomplish if they spent their entire lifetime on such an endeavor,\u201d Sad Night said in a frustrated tone.\n\nRebecca responded simply, \u201cIt is easy to discern the truth. The Moon has been here for half an hour. The power is still here. That tells us he has a very strong, but gentle, power. If this moon can remain here for a few days, he must have learned the secrets of Moon Wheel. The light I can cast only lasts a day at the most. And on top of that, the water would be disturbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait here for a few days,\u201d said the Viscount that moved the cup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he could have learned the secrets of purity and gentleness from that knife. My father should still be around. We should seek him out and have him take a look. Then we will know the truth.\u201d Du Lishe stood up and looked for Moon Wheel King.\n\nEveryone wanted to know whether or not Han Sen possessed the talent to be so pure and gentle. They did not stop her. Rebecca and Black Steel also went out in search of Moon Wheel King.\n\nMoon Wheel King was talking with a few other Kings. He felt something, and Black-Moon King said, \u201cLet them in.\u201d\n\nDu Lishe and the others entered and bowed before the Kings.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you guys think we old farts are boring? What are you doing here?\u201d Black-Moon King smiled.\n\nDu Lishe hastily explained what had occurred to the Kings. She grabbed Moon Wheel King\u2019s arm and said, \u201cFather, come take a look and help us understand what Han Sen did.\u201d\n\nReally? Let me come and take a look.\u201d Moon Wheel King and the others looked shocked. They followed Du Lishe to the garden.\n\nWhen they returned to the garden, Du Lishe pointed to the light and said, \u201cThis is it! Do you think this is Moon, Father?\u201d\n\nMoon Wheel King had seen the light from all the way across the garden. He sighed and said, \u201cHan Sen\u2019s skills are the best. He examined the leftover power I used to activate the knife, and from it, he was able to learn that much? This is very rare.\u201d\n\nHearing Moon Wheel King say that shocked Du Lishe and the others. They no longer harbored any doubt.\n\n\u201cFather, how gentle is Han Sen?\u201d Rebecca asked.\n\n\u201cI will say thirty percent. I would be glad if you possessed that level of skill when you reach a Duke. It is acceptable to only achieve it upon reaching King class,\u201d Moon Wheel King said.\n\nEveryone was so shocked, they could not speak.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame he has such good talents, but even so, he wasn\u2019t able to become a Viscount without consuming two to three hundred waterdrops. He had to swallow a Red Mist Soul to get this geno art and strength. If Yisha gave him everything, he\u2019d be lucky to reach Duke. There is no way he can reach King at this rate,\u201d Night River King growled.\n\nAfter hearing that, the young ones felt better. Han Sen\u2019s talent was so scary, it was hard not to be disturbed by it."
