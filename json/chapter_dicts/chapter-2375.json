It looked as if she had returned to being a young woman.\n\nThe Siren Elder swung her fishtail, and waves surged out behind her as she swam away from the blood altar and went toward Han Sen and Lan Haixin. She laughed haughtily. \u201cAs long as I possess the holy bottle, anything I desire is within my grasp.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the Siren Elder waved her hand. A rainbow light fired at Han Sen and Lan Haixin. Her powers were now very different than her original abilities, and her attack was similar to the blurry rainbow lights that were visible inside the Siren Bottle.\n\nThe blurry rainbow lights came down, transforming into crystal bottles around Han Sen and the others to trap them.\n\nHan Sen had seen the Crystal God Conch use an almost identical power, and now he knew for sure that the power had come from the Siren Bottle.\n\nBut the Siren Elder was weaker than the Crystal God Conch had been. She generated a substance chain power, but it was very weak. It wasn\u2019t solid like the Crystal God Conch\u2019s substance chains.\n\n\u201cIt looks like she can\u2019t really control the power of the Siren Bottle, but how did the Crystal God Conch wield the Siren Bottle\u2019s power so well? It couldn\u2019t have activated the Siren Bottle. And it didn\u2019t have the Siren blood necessary to perform the sacrifice, either,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nLan Haixin\u2019s power struck the crystal bottle, but the attempt was futile. Her attack struck the surface of the bottle with King class power, but it wasn\u2019t enough to even rattle it on the spot.\n\n\u201cHaha! It is useless! This is the Siren Bottle\u2019s power\u2026 Allow me to take your blood so that I may use it on the Siren Bottle. When I control it in its entirety, I will achieve even more power, and then I can start my own race that will exist all across the universe. I will become an alpha!\u201d A maniacal grin split the Siren Elder\u2019s face, and the rainbow colors that enshrouded her became even brighter.\n\nThe glass bottle grew smaller as the Siren Elder applied pressure to it. She wanted to squash the people inside it.\n\n\u201cLittle red bird.\u201d Han Sen understood how the Siren Elder was making use of the Siren Bottle, but he didn\u2019t hesitate to summon the little red bird.\n\nThe little red bird fluttered over to Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder, then it hopped onto Han Sen\u2019s finger and chirped at him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about done here. Get rid of this old hag, but leave her final few breaths to me. I want to finish her off myself,\u201d Han Sen commanded the little red bird.\n\nThe Siren Elder looked as if she had heard a funny joke, and she laughed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end yet, and you are already going crazy.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nThe words had barely left the Siren Elder\u2019s mouth when the little red bird took flight. Flames began to lick around her body as she rose from Han Sen\u2019s finger. Suddenly, the little red bird turned into a gold fire phoenix.\n\nThe phoenix wings gave a couple of powerful beats, raising swathes of fire that charred the walls of the glass bottle. The substance chains that composed the crystal walls were like paper. The flames danced across them, and they were incinerated into ashes in a flash.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Siren Elder\u2019s power is far inferior to the Crystal God Conch\u2019s. This is like a fake deified\u2019s power,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cDei\u2013deified xenogeneic\u2026 No\u2026 Impossible!\u201d The Siren Elder\u2019s eyes were wide, filled with utter disbelief at what she saw.\n\nLan Haixin couldn\u2019t believe it, either. She stared in amazement at the little red bird that had turned into a fire phoenix.\n\nThe two Sirens were familiar with the little red bird already, as Bao\u2019er played with the creature every day. And she especially liked to bully it. Lan Haixin sometimes felt sorry for the little thing, but it had never seemed to mind getting bullied by Bao\u2019er. It continued to follow her at all times.\n\nThat little red bird was actually a deified xenogeneic. The thought was mind-boggling.\n\nBut the truth couldn\u2019t be denied. The fire phoenix that the little red bird had turned into was now flying towards the old Siren woman. And when it reached her, it spat out a golden fireball.\n\nThe Siren Elder screamed, her voice thrumming weirdly around them. Her body was shining, and that light became a glass bottle that tried to encase the little red bird, but it turned to dust the instant it came close to those fires. The flames lashed wildly towards the Siren Elder.\n\nThe Siren Elder was unable to dodge. She gathered up her angelic god light to block the attacks with her hands, but when her hands touched the fire, they started to burn. And then, her whole body was aflame.\n\n\u201cArgh, no! This is impossible! I want to be an alpha\u2026 I want to receive this holy bottle\u2026\u201d the Siren Elder screamed angrily as the cruel fire consumed her. Not long after, her burned body was turned to ash.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a real deified power, huh? It looks like her methods were riddled with flaws. Bai Yi and Lan Haixin\u2019s blood have to be combined to control the Siren Bottle.\u201d Han Sen pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife. He walked forward and cut off the dying Siren Elder\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cMutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Siren Lady. Mutant xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen killed the Siren Elder, the fire continued to burn. The Siren Elder\u2019s body turned into ash. A blue gem that must have been her xenogeneic gene sat amidst the grey.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t get her beast soul!\u201d Han Sen grabbed the gem and held it in the palm of his hand.\n\nHan Sen placed the blue gem into his chest pocket, then approached the altar.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen tried going to the altar, but the blurry rainbow stopped him short.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He simulated the Siren Elder, but he still couldn\u2019t access the altar.\n\nLan Haixin bit her lips and said, \u201cIt looks like you have wasted your efforts here. You won\u2019t be able to get the holy bottle, after all.\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored her. She looked at the Siren Bottle for a while and suddenly said, \u201cIt is you, right? The Sirens\u2019 final holy virgin, Bai Yi\u2019s mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a clever kid.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice came out of the Siren Bottle. The blurry rainbow in the bottle came into focus, turning into a beautiful Siren woman who hung at the entrance.\n\nShe had white ears and white scales. Her skin looked like jade, and it was even smoother than Han Sen\u2019s Jadeskin.\n\nHer hair was long and black, and it reached down to her waist. Her eyes were like obsidian. Her face was very attractive, and a soft smile warmed her expression.\n\n\u201cHo\u2026 Holy Virgin\u2026\u201d Lan Haixin stared at the woman by the Siren Bottle in shock. She didn\u2019t know how to compose herself at that moment.\n\nAll the things she thought could never happen had transpired in such an incredibly short time. Lan Haixin felt like her entire lifetime hadn\u2019t contained as many unexpected twists as the last ten minutes."
