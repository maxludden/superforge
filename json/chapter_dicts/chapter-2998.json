    "text": "Han Sen knew the kill sky hammer\u2019s radius of attack was scary, but there was nothing he could do about it. That thing was very powerful, but no one was able to control the radius of that power.\n\nLuckily, the closer to the center of the shaking point someone was, the more shaking power there was. They were quite far away, so the shaking power they felt was quite weak. If it was like Moment God\u2019s power. When facing the kill sky hammer face-to-face, one of those attacks would have probably nearly killed Sun Moon God Ape.\n\nMoment God saw where the kill sky hammer came from. She knew that the power of the hammer could break every other power. She ignored Bao\u2019er. She flashed above Golden Growler, put her hands together really fast, and made a weird symbol. It was heading for Golden Growler. There was a wave headed for Golden Growler, so it opened its mouth. The gold door only exited its mouth halfway. The door was frozen there. All of that happened in just one moment. At the same time, Golden Growler stopped moving. Moment God flashed away. She dodged Bai King\u2019s knife sword, which was crazily slashing. She appeared in front of Han Sen. She carried the time light. Her hand was reaching out for Han Sen\u2019s light scissors.\n\nHan Sen knew Moment Goddess was afraid of the golden door that came out of Golden Growler\u2019s mouth. Even if her power could not kill Golden Growler, it could trap it. If she could kill him, she would have done it already.\n\nMoment God moved to take the light scissors away so that Golden Growler could not be set free again. \u201cAn Annihilation class God Spirit is hard to deal with. I wonder how scary a Reboot class God Spirit is.\u201d Han Sen used the time area. The time element did not have much of an effect on Moment God. Instead, Han Sen was affected by Moment God\u2019s time god power effect. His movement was very slow. He could not dodge her and prevent her from stealing the scissors.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s body flashed. She was suddenly above Han Sen\u2019s head. The hammer was striking toward Moment God\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Moment God had no reaction. Han Sen, Bai King, Sun Moon God Ape, and Space Spirit screamed. Their faces looked black.\n\nEarlier, Bao\u2019er had waved her hammer a few times, which almost shook them to death. Their bones almost cracked. Now, it was about to come down near their bodies. It was going to kill them.\n\nUnfortunately, it was too late for anything. The hammer in Bao\u2019er\u2019s hand had already hit Moment God\u2019s hand.\n\nHan Sen knew this was going to be bad. He flashed backward and raised the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze to try and protect his body.\n\nBai King used his spirit body to raise a shield and protect himself as he quickly retreated.\n\nSun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit were running away as fast as they could. Their foreheads were dripping with cold sweat.\n\nBoom!\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Han Sen and the others screamed. It was like a television show in which they were blown away. The four of them blew up, flew, and rolled away. All the God blood spilling out was like it was for free.\n\nHan Sen and Bai King were faring a little better. Only their bones and organs were ripped. Sun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit only had half their lives left. That was especially true of Sun Moon God Ape. His limbs were soft, and he was twisted like a pretzel. He was going to be disabled. \u201cBig God, please stop shaking me\u2026 Cough\u2026 Cough\u2026 Moment God still hasn\u2019t touched me\u2026 Cough\u2026 Cough\u2026 I am going to be killed by you\u2026\u201d Sun Moon God Ape was speaking and throwing up blood at the same time. He was going to cry. \u201cShut the hell up! You\u2019re only a little bit hurt, yet you are crying. Are you a 3-year-old child?\u201d Bao\u2019er lifted her lips. She then lifted her finger, enabling a giant lotus light to come out of it. The petals had a holy light. The body of Sun Moon God Ape was covered in that holy light. The wounds were healing fast. It was at an unbelievable speed. The lotus light was the true god beast soul Han Sen had claimed from the Light Well Lotus. It had a powerful healing bai sema. Han Sen had given it to Bao\u2019er. If Bao\u2019er was in danger, she could use the lotus to save her life.\n\nSuddenly, Sun Moon God Ape and others saw their severe wounds healing. Sun Moon God Ape was very happy and said, \u201cDollar Big God, you really can do everything.\u201d \u201cStop talking crap! Give me your time and space power!\u201d Bao\u2019er shouted. She was holding her little hammer and going toward Moment God.\n\nSun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit were busy gathering their powers. They buffed Bao\u2019er so that she could catch up with Moment God.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe power of the kill sky hammer struck Moment God\u2019s time god power again. Bao\u2019er used her kill sky hammer to fight Moment God face-to-face and not lose. It was bad for Sun Moon God Ape. Although there was the Light Well Lotus healing bai sema for protection, the bai sema could only heal. It could not block the damage.\n\nSun Moon God Ape was being shaken again. Everyone was spitting out blood and healing. Their bones broke and healed and healed and broke. Their organs ripped and healed and healed and ripped. It was like they were suffering absolute torture. It felt absolutely awful.\n\n\u201cDollar Big God really is the strongest in the universe. He can fight Moment God without losing.\u201d \u201cDollar Big God is so overbearing and strong. Go and kill Moment God and bring the creatures of the universe some dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDollar Big God is invincible.\u201d The creatures from every race started to speak like Sun Moon God Ape. They added the two words after every mention of Dollar\u2019s name. No one thought it was an unworthy title.\n\nMost of the creatures in the universe thought Dollar was the big universe\u2019s first strongest elite. The other true gods were too weak before Dollar. Calling him a big god was to separate him from other elites.\n\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d Human King squinted his eyes. He watched Bao\u2019er battle Moment God. His eyes looked weird for a second.\n\nThe red-clothed woman stood behind him and said, \u201cI think this Dollar has an even higher chance of breaking that level, yet Han Jinzhi wants us to assist Han Sen. Are you sure he is not just showing bias?\u201d\n\nHuman King laughed and said, \u201cDollar is strong, but he is depending on his god personality armament. He has the evil lotus bai sema and sky bone knife armor too. That hammer, if I am not mistaken, is Kill Sky God\u2019s god personality armament. I bet Kill Sky God descended to kill him, and he killed him. That is how he got that Annihilation class god personality armament.\u201d\n\n\u201cKill Sky God possessed someone and descended?\u201d the red-clothed woman asked. \u201cIt would have been so much weaker. Even so, killing Kill Sky God would have been an almighty task. He did not have the kill sky hammer at the time.\u201d\n\nHuman King nodded and said, \u201cThis kid is very rare. I do not know who created this monster. His genes are complex. They are more complex than a creature from the sanctuaries.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone was talking, Han Sen approached Golden Growler with his light scissors. He knew Bao\u2019er did not have much time. He had to finish the fight to save Golden Growler.\n\nIn that massive fight, Bao\u2019er might not have been able to last an hour before she spent all her power."
