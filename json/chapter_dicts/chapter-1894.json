    "text": "Not much later, the Rebate Noble heirs were beaten. Their armors had been broken, and their faces were all swollen. They fell to the ground, crying their eyes out.\n\nSpeechless, No Flower, and Black Cliff were all in shock. It was unheard of, for a nameless Viscount to beat down so many Nobles. Xie Qing King seemed terribly overpowered.\n\nAnd he was nothing more than a guard in Han Sen\u2019s roster. It was a scary thought.\n\n\u201cIt looks like solo, or even in group fights, you guys are all weak. None of you can fight,\u201d Xie Qing King said simply, and then returned to the entrance.\n\nHe returned to standing at his station like a proper guardsman, and he paid them no further attention.\n\nSad Night picked himself up off the ground. His face was completely swollen, stained with blood and dirt. His eyes were bloodshot. He wanted to go and hide.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t mind losing to Han Sen, but he and the other Rebate had been beaten by an insignificant Viscount. This wasn\u2019t just embarrassing to them; this was an embarrassment to their elders. Everyone would be laughing if news of these events ever spread.\n\nThe worst thing about it, though, was that Speechless and No Flower had seen it all.\n\n\u201cBlack Cliff, what do you think?\u201d Sad Night looked at Black Cliff. Sad Night was not going to continue fighting, as that would just lead to greater embarrassment. But Black Cliff was different. He was the oldest son of Black-Moon King, and he was a Duke. If he struck, it was unlikely anyone near Mirror Lake could withstand the blow.\n\n\u201cI am only here to see Han Sen\u2019s Knife Blank. The rest of this is none of my business,\u201d Black Cliff said with disinterest.\n\nSad Night\u2019s face went red. He looked at Black Cliff, then left. He was way too embarrassed to stay now. A few more of the Nobles drifted away, and then the rest got up and said goodbye to Speechless and No Flower.\n\nSpeechless and No Flower didn\u2019t want to leave yet. They were happy to wait outside with Black Cliff.\n\nAfter half an hour, Han Sen exited the base.\n\nHan Sen looked at Black Cliff and the Buddhas. With a frown, he said, \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Black Cliff, from Planet Black-Moon. I have heard you are in possession of a mystic Knife Blank. I would like to borrow it. The conditions are yours to decide,\u201d Black Cliff said, looking at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAre you related to Black Steel?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cBlack Steel is my fourth brother,\u201d Black Cliff answered.\n\n\u201cIf you are a sibling of Black Steel, please come inside.\u201d Han Sen welcomed him inside.\n\nBlack Cliff was willing to comply, and he let one of the Kate lead him forward.\n\n\u201cWhat do you two need?\u201d Han Sen looked at Speechless and No Flower.\n\n\u201cAmitabha. I am No Flower of the Buddha. This is Speechless Buddha Lady. I have heard Knife Queen accepted a genius for a student, and so we have eagerly looked forward to meeting him.\u201d No Flower bowed.\n\n\u201cWell, you guys have met him. You can go now.\u201d Han Sen turned around and walked back into the base.\n\n\u201cHang on\u2026\u201d Pang! Before No Flower could speak, Han Sen had closed the gate.\n\nSpeechless and No Flower had seen a lot in their time. They had seen many people express all sorts of different tempers, but Han Sen was unique amongst all they had seen.\n\n\u201cThe student of Knife Queen is special.\u201d No Flower had a wry smile.\n\n\u201cNever mind. If he doesn\u2019t want to see us, then we\u2019d best depart.\u201d Speechless looked strange as she made the decision. \u201cThat is the only way, I suppose.\u201d No Flower nodded.\n\nThey left the base and flew off in the aircraft. Speechless was thinking to herself, \u201cKnife Queen wouldn\u2019t just accept any student. We haven\u2019t yet found out why she selected him, but seeing how strong his followers are, it might suggest he is hiding something. I need to force him to talk to me sometime.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen went back into the base, he went to the meeting room to discuss things with Black Cliff.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to see my Knife Blank?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe Knife Blank was not an ordinary item. If Black Cliff hadn\u2019t been Black Steel\u2019s brother, Han Sen wouldn\u2019t have let him in, regardless of his rank. He certainly wouldn\u2019t let him see the Knife Blank.\n\nBlack Cliff said, \u201cThe Black family forges weaponry, and I am quite skilled at the process. I have been doing this for fifty years, but even now, I have yet to be able to forge a King class knife. And that\u2019s all because I\u2019ve never been able to get my hands on decent materials. Only fine materials can make what I seek to create. I have heard the Knife Blank you found inside Knife Grave is a good item. So, I was hoping I might borrow it. And if not, I hoped I could make an offer to purchase it outright.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on selling it. And you do know that because it came from Knife Grave, it cannot actually be forged?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cThe weaponry from Knife Grave can be forged; you just have to know how. It\u2019s okay if you do not wish to sell the material, but if it does work, I can forge it into something of your choosing, all for free. I\u2019d even be willing to pay. You will still keep ownership of the knife, too.\u201d Black Cliff looked excited.\n\nHan Sen thought that was a worthy bargain. The Knife Blank was only a Knife Blank. He couldn\u2019t utilize its powers, so it would be great if it could be forged.\n\nIt\u2019d be free, and it\u2019d also come from the best blacksmith of the Rebate. That was a very good deal.\n\nHan Sen did not need to worry about Black Cliff destroying the weapon. This was Narrow Moon, and he wouldn\u2019t do something like that unless he was genuinely crazy.\n\nAnd Black Cliff did not look like a crazy man, so Han Sen was not worried.\n\n\u201cOkay, please wait here.\u201d Han Sen asked someone to bring the Knife Blank. But just as he was about to hand it over, he felt that something was wrong.\n\nWhen Black Cliff saw the Knife Blank, he froze. It looked as if his eyes were on fire. The fire did not really exist, but Han Sen could see it. It looked very familiar.\n\n\u201cKing Jun.\u201d Han Sen immediately recalled where he had seen this before.\n\nThe gold sunbird that Han Sen had killed, and the being called King Jun that named himself Skygod, and the fire he used\u2026 What Han Sen saw in Black Cliff\u2019s eyes reminded him of all that.\n\nHan Sen was going to hand the Knife Blank over, but right before he did, he pulled it back.\n\n\u201cKnife Blank. Knife Blank.\u201d Black Cliff was acting as if he had been possessed. He mumbled over and over, as he tried to grab the Knife Blank from Han Sen.\n\n\u201cF*ck! King Jun is behind this!\u201d Han Sen immediately reacted. Unless Black Cliff was stupid or just plain mad, he wouldn\u2019t have come here to try to steal the Knife Blank. Even if he stole it and killed Han Sen in the process, he couldn\u2019t have owned it.\n\nBut that seemed to be exactly what Black Cliff was doing. The man\u2019s mind seemed to be scrambled. And it reminded Han Sen of King Jun Skygod."
