That\u2019s fine by me!\u201d Yaksha was now getting infuriated with Han Sen. He and Disloyal Knight had wasted too much time already, and Yaksha knew now that he had to take them out.\n\nYaksha\u2019s wings were strong, but he could not remain at that speed the whole time.\n\nHe flapped the wings and appeared in front of Han Sen with a whooshing sound.\n\nYaksha tried to grab Han Sen but he failed\u2014Han Sen had dodged it.\n\nYaksha\u2019s face curdled like sour milk and he barked, \u201cThat must have been a coincidence! How could you evade my Yaksha speed?!\u201d\n\nHan Sen was delighted at what he had just managed to do. Han Sen was indeed much slower than Yaksha. But he had opened his fifth tier of the Dongxuan Sutra. His ability to read the minds of others was really coming into its own.\n\nYaksha wanted to eliminate Han Sen with a burning desire. It was a simplistic notion, and it was reflected in the workings of his mind. Han Sen knew exactly what he was thinking in this endeavor.\n\n\u201cI am going to dig his heart out.\u201d Han Sen heard his mind speak these words and reacted before Yaksha even made a move.\n\nAlthough Han Sen could not entirely dodge the next attack, he managed to get away with only a slight scratch.\n\n\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got, Yaksha?!\u201d Han Sen yelled and started laughing at his humiliation.\n\nYaksha was as shocked as he was angry. The fact that Han Sen\u2019s evasion had worked twice made it seem unlikely that he was just getting lucky.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t catch up with my Yaksha speed.\u201d Yaksha used the same move to attack again.\n\nAnd like before, Han Sen heard exactly what he proposed to do and when he proposed to do it. With effective judgment, he managed to dodge it.\n\nWith the magic of the Dongxuan Sutra and phoenix techniques, plus the Blood-Pulse Sutra and Disloyal Knight\u2019s power, Han Sen did not even have to cast super king spirit right now.\n\nQueen was in shock, watching them fight like so. She said out loud, \u201cWow, he\u2019s that strong already?! I have my work cut out for me if I hope to keep up!\u201d\n\nAfter watching for a while, she began to feel depressed.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s skill was on a whole different level than hers, and it made her feel useless. She almost felt as if she didn\u2019t deserve to be at his side.\n\n\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d Queen watched Han Sen with a complicated expression.\n\nBut Queen was still Queen, and her will to improve and go on did not falter. In fact, after witnessing all this, it only grew. The fire of her heart was stoked with an even bolder flame.\n\nQueen continued to watch and observe Han Sen\u2019s movements. She recalled how she used to teach Han Sen Heavenly Go, but now, it was almost the other way around. She viewed him intently, learning how to perform phoenix techniques as he did.\n\nQueen was a very talented person, and when Han Sen used phoenix techniques, they inspired her greatly.\n\nWhat Queen considered to be the most valuable of Han Sen\u2019s abilities were his skills of prediction. She had no clue how Han Sen managed to dodge half the attacks he always did, particularly so now, with the frightening foe that was Yaksha.\n\nBecause Han Sen was much slower, which was plain to see, she thought it\u2019d be impossible for him to dodge and evade in the manner he was doing. The only way he could stay ahead was if he knew what the attacker was going to perform beforehand. How Han Sen might have done so enthralled her.\n\nAnd every time, in succession, Han Sen did indeed dodge with success. It was an excellent show.\n\nQueen did not know Han Sen had learned the Dongxuan Sutra, though. She just thought he was a brilliant guesser. Queen was a very talented person, as well. Even Huangfu Xiongcheng told her she was perfect for the learning of Heavenly Go.\n\nBut now, as she watched Han Sen, she believed herself to not be half as good. She thought she was lame, in comparison.\n\n\u201cIf my talents are as rare as others say, then what does he have that I or others don\u2019t? What magic propels him?\u201d Queen was in shock and awe over his display.\n\nQueen was not one to concede or throw in the towel, though. The better Han Sen was, the better she wanted to be. And that was an admirable trait.\n\nHan Sen did not know this was the way Queen felt. The Dongxuan Sutra was the reason he could fight as he was.\n\nHan Sen was currently fighting like a dragon, and with Disloyal Knight by his side, he was only getting better and better against his nemesis.\n\nHe was used to predicting the moves of his enemies, and his talent with this was only getting better. Yaksha was moving extremely fast, and although he delivered the occasional scrape, it was happening less and less often. Han Sen was being dealt less and less damage.\n\nWhile Han Sen fought, a power came from someplace to the side. He blocked it with his arm.\n\nCha!\n\nA grey spear pierced through his arm and cut through his bone.\n\nHan Sen looked to where the spear might have come from, and he noticed it was the rat king that was stood atop the pillar. It was laughing, and then it turned into another spear and flew towards Han Sen.\n\nWith the rock rats now joining the fight, seeking to stop Han Sen, things were about to go very bad.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the rat king looking to join the fray, either. The toad king, cricket king, and other creatures all took aim at Han Sen.\n\nSeeing the creatures all wanting to kill him, Han Sen understood what was going on. All the super creatures there wanted Xiang Yin to fail so they could dine on her flesh. Just like Yaksha, none of them wanted her to succeed."
