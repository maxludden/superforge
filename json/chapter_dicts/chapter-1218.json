What it was, he could not yet tell. It was human in shape, hovering horizontally as if it were lying down. It was a Lynchian sight; one that unnerved him.\n\nAs he stared down at the crystallized ground, he heard a katcha sound. Then, the crystal underfoot began to web with cracks. The cracks spread across the peak as if they were netting it, like the keen silkworks of a spider. Eventually, it all shattered and left a deep hole in the ground.\n\nOnly the tower remained firm and standing. Everywhere else was suddenly tossed into ruin and dusty chaos.\n\nHan Sen and Little Angel had taken flight and watched the scene unfold from the sky.\n\nThe hole seemed bottomless, and what might have resided way down in the pitch black depths of that place, Han Sen could not tell. There was only one place they could see that was unaffected.\n\nThere was a floating purple platform perched above the black abyss that had just formed. Atop it stood a handsome man clad in purple armor. His eyelashes were very long, and he was a drop-dead gorgeous man to look upon.\n\nHan Sen had seen many handsome shura and spirits in his time, but they all paled in comparison to this person. The strangest thing was the fact that Han Sen was detecting a human energy radiating from him.\n\n\u201cIs he human?\u201d Han Sen asked himself, as he looked at him.\n\n\u201cWas he trapped here by the skeleton?\u201d Han Sen continued to wonder.\n\nThe human opened his eyes to reveal black pits, painting him as an even more mystic and enticing person. The skeleton had stopped reading the scroll at this point. He put it away before walking forward to approach the man on the platform.\n\nWhen the skeleton had nearly reached the platform, the man still hadn\u2019t moved. He still looked a little unconscious, lying down as if in peaceful slumber.\n\n\u201cHe must have been trapped by the skeleton; he had to have been!\u201d Han Sen unsheathed his swords and rushed forward to attack the skeleton. He didn\u2019t want the man to get hurt.\n\nLittle Angel and Disloyal Knight accompanied Han Sen in the assault. But when the skeleton saw them coming, it quickly re-opened the scroll and prohibited their advance.\n\nHan Sen finally saw the scroll and what it contained when the skeleton used it again. The words upon the scroll were gold, and it was written in an ancient language of the Alliance.\n\nHe could recognize this due to his study of languages in his time away from the sanctuaries.\n\nDong!\n\nThe Phoenix Sword and Taia, the Angel Sword, and Disloyal Knight\u2019s fist were thrown forward to break the scroll, but none were effective. Following this, a fight erupted, and not even the combined might of the three had what it took to tackle the skeleton.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, seeing how the scroll could block them all. Little Angel had ten gene locks open, which made her the strongest of the three. So, it was frightening to think what power the skeleton might have truly possessed if it was able to repel and subdue the trio.\n\nThe green flames that surged inside the skeleton\u2019s sockets raged, and they flared as if the skeleton was angry about their disturbance. It started to enshroud itself in a black smoke of sorts, and it didn\u2019t take long for the smoke to cover its entire body.\n\nThe smoke eventually took the form of armor, which suited up the skeleton. With the fire that followed it, the skeleton looked like the reaper geared up for war. The skeleton, in its dark armor, gave off a terrible, frightening aura. Sensing the power its scrawny body actually wielded, Han Sen\u2019s face turned grim.\n\nSnowball was hidden in Bao\u2019er\u2019s chest as this happened. Bao\u2019er had already brought out the gourd, but for some reason, she did not yet use it.\n\nHan Sen rarely encountered foes that filled him with such a sense of dread or that exuded such power. Such enemies were few and far in-between, but without a shadow of a doubt, the skeleton was one of that prestigious few. It was up there with the likes of Big Mara in the Ancient Devil Shelter, Xiang Yin who went to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, and Sky King of the Sky Tree.\n\nThey were beings that had opened ten gene locks, and this skeleton\u2019s energy was just like them. It was just as powerful.\n\nHan Sen would have liked to run, but the area he was in had been cordoned off with the transparent, purple walls.\n\nSeeing the skeleton now approach him, Han Sen planned to use his super king spirit mode to attempt an escape alongside Little Angel. But then, curiously, the skeleton stopped in its tracks.\n\nThe skeleton turned its attention back to the platform, as the person in slumber woke up.\n\nThe man yawned, as if he really had been roused from a long, deep sleep. After he stretched, he looked at Han Sen with much surprise.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe black-armored skeleton ran to the purple platform. With its speed, it really must have been an emperor.\n\nHan Sen shouted to the man, saying, \u201cWatch out!\u201d\n\nWhat transpired in the next second, though, shook Han Sen to his very core. It left him speechless and motionless. He stared at the man on the platform in disbelief. He thought he must have been dreaming, to witness something such like that happen.\n\nThe skeleton in black armor did not try to attack the man, it just knelt before him like a knight in a king\u2019s service.\n\n\u201cIs he really a human?\u201d Han Sen looked at the platform in deep contemplation."
