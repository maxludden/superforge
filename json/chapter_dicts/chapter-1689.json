    "text": "Five crystal-looking fingers were held against the box like the keys of a piano.\n\nThe thing started to climb out of the metal box in a strange manner, and as it left, the light inside the container dimmed. When the hand came out of the metal box, Han Sen and Old Cat were both shocked seeing it.\n\nThey thought some monster would climb out, but when the hand came out, it was just that It was just a hand with nothing else attached.\n\nThe hand was like jade, and it was connected only to a small portion of arm. There was nothing else after. The back end was like a rocket, though, exuding a fountain of light\n\nThe inside of the metal box was now empty, and the light was gone.\n\n\u201cYou said there is geno armor inside. What is that thing?\u201d Han Sen asked, pointing at the jade hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 do not know\u2026\u201d Old Cat looked at the hand, seeming confused.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but before he could, the hand bounced up. It clenched into a fist and shot forward with the light propelling it from behind. It was firing at Han Sen.\n\nIt was so fast, Han Sen was surprised. Evading it was difficult, even with the armor he was wearing.\n\nHan Sen dodged the fist. He couldn\u2019t figure out what the hand was, and he most certainly didn\u2019t want to touch it.\n\nThe hand was like a living creature. It turned around and came for him again.\n\nHan Sen kept trying to dodge, but the speed of his armor wasn\u2019t enough to keep up with the fist. He had to use his dongxuan movements and Heavenly Go to escape the hand.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. The last thing he wanted was to touch it. The hand was far too weird, and he had no clue what it was.\n\n\u201cOld Cat, come and help!\u201d Han yelled, looking at the Old Cat after another quick dodge.\n\nOld Cat didn\u2019t like Han Sen\u2019s suggestion, so he jumped atop the tablet and watched.\n\n\u201cCalm down! What\u2019s the rush? I\u2019ll observe it and learn its weakness. When I discover what it is, I\u2019ll come and save you. Okay?\u201d Old Cat did not move, and he just waved his tail while he spoke.\n\n\u201cWhen are you going to find it? Hurry up now and take it. Maybe it\u2019s a treasure, and you can have it!\u201d Han Sen tried to entice Old Cat to give him aid by making that promise.\n\nOld Cat was not buying it, though. He continued to lay on the tablet, squinting his eyes. \u201cIt depends entirely on fate. If the treasure belongs to me, none can take it\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you helping me or not?\u201d Han Sen felt disheartened.\n\n\u201cI want to, but I have no clue what this is. Please, allow me to observe,\u201d Old Cat said calmly.\n\n\u201cIf you keep observing, I will be killed. And then you will be next.\u201d Han Sen felt severely pressured. The hand was so fast, it was like light. It almost seemed like there were many fists attacking him at once.\n\nHan Sen kept on dodging. If he didn\u2019t figure something out soon, he\u2019d have no choice but to block it\n\n\u201cYou look so handsome, it\u2019s no wonder why it likes you. I really envy you. I can just stand here and be completely ignored. D*mn!\u201d Old Cat squinted his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou can go to hell,\u201d Han Sen said, then gathered strength in his own fist to combat the other with a punch.\n\nThe fist\u2019s speed was too fast now, so he couldn\u2019t dodge it, anyway. He could only try to go up against whatever power the fist held.\n\nFirstly, though, Han Sen tried to lead the hand to the cat\u2019s position. But the hand didn\u2019t care for the feline. It went right past the cat, straight for Han Sen.\n\nOld Cat looked at Han Sen and the hand. He didn\u2019t strike, because he wanted to see how strong the hand was, too.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fist came into contact with the hand, and he used all of the power he could muster, alongside what the geno armor could provide.\n\nIt was only sixty percent, but it was shocking enough it could probably sunder a mountain.\n\nBut when Han Sen\u2019s fist hit the hand, he couldn\u2019t punch it away. There was no shockwave, either.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s fist came right against the hand, and the hand deflated like a balloon. It struck itself to Han Sen\u2019s fist.\n\nThe next second, the hand was shining with a bright light. The disconnected part gloved Han Sen\u2019s right hand.\n\nHan Sen was shocked, and he desperately wanted to get rid of it. It was too late for that now, though. The jade hand had gloved Han Sen\u2019s right hand.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen\u2019s geno armor disconnected. It went back into his Sea of Soul, as if it was afraid of something.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. His fitness was low, and the geno armor was something he absolutely required. Now that it had disconnected, its protection was no longer available. This was bad news.\n\nHan Sen wanted to summon Destiny\u2019s Tower, but when he looked at his right hand again, he was shocked.\n\nThe jade-looking hand was gloved around his right hand, but in a different way than Han Sen had first thought.\n\nWhen the hand gloved Han Sen\u2019s right hand, it turned into a gauntlet that looked like jade, but it wasn\u2019t jade. It looked like bone, but it wasn\u2019t bone.\n\n\u201cIs this thing like those crystal shoes? Is it a glove?\u201d Han Sen thought of this possibility.\n\nBefore Han Sen could think any more, a strange power from his right-hand started pulling him forward. He couldn\u2019t keep his body from suddenly getting pulled into darkness.\n\n\u201cSh*t! This thing is just like those motherf*cking crystal shoes.\u201d Han Sen was struggling to stop the process. It didn\u2019t work, though, as the glove was much stronger than him."
