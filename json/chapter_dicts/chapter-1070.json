The greatsword\u2019s power was almost as strong as Han Sen, it just fell a touch short.\n\nHan Sen used his gold raven for the pursuit and evasion. Nothing else compared to its advantages there, but it did prevent him from using a multitude of other skills. The abilities he frequently used in battle were off-limits, so using the gold raven for actual combat was fairly pointless.\n\n\u201cHumanoid Shapeshifter beast souls are better; I\u2019d do well to find one of those,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBut for now, Han Sen blazed through the streets like a phoenix. When choosing to engage with Holy-Sword Emperor, he struck from a dizzying array of different angles.\n\nWith the speed at which Han Sen came for Holy-Sword Emperor, the spirit could do little to fight back, and so he was forced onto the defensive, using his greatsword to block each attack.\n\nWhen the time for him to attack did come, though, each hit was like a wave against Han Sen. Fortunately, he was able to slice and deflect each attack with his wings.\n\nHe then used Dongxuan Aura to scan the shelter. Aside from Holy-Sword Emperor and the two super creatures, there really was nothing else living there.\n\n\u201cWhere has everything gone? Has he evacuated the shelter of its inhabitants, in the knowledge he was going to die?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nWith his fight against Holy-Sword Emperor starting to look like a stalemate, Han Sen decided to fly off in search of the spirit hall.\n\nThe shelter was very large, but at the speed his transformation allowed him to travel, locating it would not take long at all.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s blood-wings burnt everything in their path, and if he wished to look inside buildings, he simply sliced the roofs of houses off.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s gleeful destruction of the shelter infuriated Holy-Sword Emperor all the more, and while the spirit tried to pursue his feathery nemesis, he could never catch up.\n\nAfter a few miles of flying, Han Sen found a hall which contained a peculiar statue. In its chest was a sword-shaped spirit stone\u2014undoubtedly Holy-Sword Emperor\u2019s, Han Sen thought.\n\nDelighted with his quick discovery of it, Han Sen made his way over.\n\nA look of shock came over Holy-Sword Emperor\u2019s face, and realizing he had no other option, he brought out the item he had taken from the treasury vault. He said, \u201cIf you won\u2019t allow me to live, then we can die together.\u201d\n\nHan Sen paid no heed to what was spoken. With the spirit stone directly in front of him, he wasn\u2019t willing to give it up now.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor, seeing no change in Han Sen\u2019s course of action, destroyed the item in his hands.\n\nThe item was black, and it was shaped like an egg. Upon breaking it, something came out.\n\nIt was like a black liquid, and it gushed out from the remains of the impossibly small, egg-shaped item. Quickly, it began to dye the entire hall black.\n\n\u201cThe spirit stone is mine!\u201d Han Sen suddenly saw black, as if something had turned off every light in the world.\n\nThis was unexpected. Even in the darkest of nights, Han Sen could see fairly well. He tried scanning the vicinity but found nothing. Strangely, he then began to feel something pulling his body.\n\nWhen Han Sen regained control, he was able to see clearly again. He was still in front of the statue, as if nothing had changed.\n\nBut when Han Sen raised his head, he was frozen.\n\nHan Sen saw a giant face in front of him that was bigger than the palace itself. It smiled as if it were a Buddha.\n\nBut its facial features most certainly weren\u2019t like that of a Buddha. It was a woman\u2019s face, curtained by long, delicate strands of hair. The woman\u2019s face looked as if it could swallow Han Sen whole at any second.\n\nStrangely, though, it wasn\u2019t alive. It was just a statue, one that had been made from copper.\n\nHan Sen tried not to think too much of its sudden appearance, so he leaped back up and grabbed the spirit stone before doing anything else.\n\nHoly-Sword Emperor, seeing his stone taken, stood there saying, \u201cI was going to try and grab Xie Qing King, too. But you have been a thorn in my backside for as long as he has. You will do. See you in h*ll, squirt.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Holy-Sword Emperor\u2019s sword gleamed before his body exploded in a haze of light.\n\nThe moment he exploded, the spirit stone shattered in Han Sen\u2019s hands.\n\nAll Han Sen could present was a wry smile, as it had been a while since he had last seen a spirit kill itself.\n\nAll of a sudden, Han Sen\u2019s figure returned to that of a human again. He floated upwards to get a look at his surroundings. Judging from what Holy-Sword Emperor had told him, nothing good looked set to happen.\n\nWhen Han Sen reached the sky, his face became glum at what he saw.\n\nA large portion of the shelter had been torn away, as another part of the shelter was lifted into the sky by the statue\u2019s hand. The statue was unbelievably massive.\n\nAnd now, Han Sen could what this statue of a woman looked like in full. She was clad in armor, and she possessed wings. A strange light glowed around the statue, with a skirt of black mist around that."
