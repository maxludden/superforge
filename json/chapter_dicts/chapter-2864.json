No matter how powerful they were, they should not have had the power of a god.\n\nSky Armor God was damaged by the Extreme King. Now, he was damaged by Han Sen. He was furious. He activated his god personality to try and kill Han Sen.\n\nWhen the god personality raged, Sky Armor God used his power to the max. Han Sen clearly saw the universe had a universal cogwheel. The light Sky Armor God\u2019s outside skeleton armor was dyed purple. It had the same color as the skeleton armor. All of the universal cogwheels that connected to the substance chains were being affected. Han Sen tried to use his Dongxuan Area to control the purple universal cogwheels, but he noticed he was unable to do anything about them. It was like the universal cogwheels formed an independent operation mode. It was like they were not getting affected by the Dongxuan Area.\n\nBzzt!\n\nSky Armor God continued his approach. The flickering, purple lights of the universal cogwheels made them spin faster. It made the substance chains move faster.\n\n\u201cDestiny\u2019s knife armor bone is like jail. God\u2019s sky armor.\u201d Sky Armor God\u2019s voice boomed like thunder. The purple light was spreading in front of his chest. It became a purple light knife. It suddenly trapped Han Sen\u2019s body inside it.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s Sky Radish God Lance exploded with a scary green light. It swept across the purple light knife, but the Sky Radish God Lance touched the purple light knife. The purple light knife did not break. It was not shaken away. It stuck to the Sky Radish God Lance.\n\nKa-ka\u2026 ka-ka\u2026\n\nHan Sen saw the purple light knife sticking to the Sky Radish God Lance and realized it was a layer of purple bones. The purple bones were stuck to the Sky Radish God Lance. It was like Sky Radish God Lance had a bone lock shell, and every bone was stuck to it. Han Sen felt the Sky Radish God Lance become heavier. In the blink of an eye, Han Sen was almost unable to hold the Sky Radish God Lance.\n\nAt the same time, the purple light knife was shining at Han Sen from all angles. Han Sen dragged the Sky Radish God Lance, wanting to use his Space Teleportation to leave. He noticed that the universal cogwheels around him were cut-off by the purple universal cogwheels. Unless he could break the purple universal cogwheels, he could not use Space Teleportation to escape.\n\nHan Sen had to swing his fist to fight. He wanted to shake away the purple light knife. When the purple light knife touched his fist, it became a bone slice.\n\nWithin a moment, Han Sen\u2019s body was covered in bone slices. The Sky Radish God Lance had them too. Han Sen\u2019s entire body was hanging in space. He was like a statue that wore bone armor.\n\nWith the suppression of the bone slices, Han Sen\u2019s power could not move an inch. All the power in his body exploded like crazy. He could barely stand. He did not get crushed by the bone slices. \u201cSo, what if you have a god personality armament? A low-life creature is a low-life creature. It does not matter what you have. In front of a god, you are just a worthless piece of trash.\u201d Sky Armor God coldly looked at Han Sen. His eyes looked scary and murderous. With the things he said, the bone slices on Han Sen started to go straight and turn into weapons. They were going to cut into Han Sen\u2019s flesh, riddling his skin with thousands and thousands of cuts.\n\nThe bone slices were incredibly sharp. They pierced into Han Sen\u2019s flesh. Even though Han Sen\u2019s body was like a true god body, he could not block the cuts dealt by those bone slices. The scariest thing about it was that the bone slice suppression prevented his power from leaking beyond them. Han Sen was unable to move.\n\n\u201cThis is what you get for committing blasphemous acts upon a god spirit. The Sky Armor Bone Jail will strip you of your flesh. It will have you pay for your crimes.\u201d Sky Armor God looked very excited.\n\n\u201cGame over. Now Dollar cannot even concede.\u201d Li Keer turned pale. She was worried about Dollar.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that the god personality armament looks like it was not Dollar himself that went to the geno hall to get the god personality armament.\u201d Bai King shook his head.\n\n\u201cHe has a god personality armament but still cannot kill a god.\u201d In Sky Palace, the woman looked disappointed. \u201cDollar is only butterfly class,\u201d Sky Palace leader said with a sigh and a look of great shame. \u201cHis flesh is still better than a true god. He can fight a true god but not a god spirit. If he can level up to true god, I would say he stands a very good chance. What a shame. I am afraid he will not have another chance at this.\u201d\n\nTang Zhenliu looked into the space battleground. He was shouting, \u201cKeep going! Don\u2019t just stand there!\u201d\n\nWang Yuhang and the others all looked a bit pale. Ning Yue looked scared while holding Bao\u2019er\u2019s arm. Little Angel and Zero were watching Han Sen with eyes full of worry. It seemed as if the creatures of the universe forgot to breathe. They nervously looked at the bone slices cutting into Han Sen\u2019s flesh. They were thinking of the cruel scene that was going to happen. Han Sen, who had countless bone slices piercing into his flesh, finally spoke. \u201cYou are Sky Armor God, right?\u201d \u201cI did not expect you to know my god title,\u201d Sky Armor God coldly said. \u201cAre you really a god?\u201d Han Sen asked. \u201cNot bad, but it is too late to beg,\u201d Sky Armor God confidently said. \u201cPerforming a blasphemous act against a god spirit is something that cannot be forgiven.\u201d Han Sen looked at Sky Armor God and coldly said, \u201cUnforgiveable is used well. My blasphemy to a god spirit should have me cut up thousands of times without forgiveness. You forced your way into another creature\u2019s body and also killed people. What is a crime like that worth?\u201d\n\nSky Armor God laughed and said, \u201cI am God. Gods control the universe. I have not sinned. Even if I have sinned, everyone should suffer. Who can judge me? I am God.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Han Sen calmly said. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Sky Armor God thought that was funny. He looked at Han Sen like he was a funny clown. \u201cIf no one can judge you, then I will judge you.\u201d Han Sen was still calmly looking at Sky Armor God. \u201cDo you think you can judge me, God? I am right here. How are you going to judge me?\u201d Sky Armor God looked at Han Sen like he was smiling, but he wasn\u2019t smiling. His words were smothered in a joking tone of voice. Han Sen\u2019s body was going to get cut, yet he could still talk like that. From Sky Armor God\u2019s perspective, he was a lunatic.\n\nIt was not just Sky Armor God thinking that. Most creatures in the universe started to wonder if Han Sen was crazy. In a time like that, he could still talk that way.\n\n\u201cSo, Sky Armor God, allow me to judge you.\u201d Han Sen looked at Sky Armor God as he slowly spoke each word.\n\nWhile Han Sen spoke, his left eye, which had the black and white color, was flashing. Suddenly, the eye no longer looked human. It looked like a cold, mechanical eye."
