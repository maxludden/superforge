The process was pretty much like how Han Sen could combine himself with Little Angel.\n\nBut when Han Sen combined with Little Angel, Han Sen\u2019s body was the primary controller. Little Angel was secondary.\n\nElysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng were equals. They completed each other.\n\nBefore, whenever Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, he had always thought they were so pretty that any man could fall for them. Even Han Sen caught himself watching them, now and again. After all, everyone liked to admire pretty women.\n\nWhen Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon completed themselves, Han Sen no longer felt as if he was looking at a human. The beauty of the being that emerged was unearthly. A sword fairy stood in front of him; she was so pretty that she no longer looked like something that belonged in this world.\n\nThe black hair spilled down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes were like pools of black water. It looked as if she could see into the bottom of a person\u2019s heart with a mere glance. She could look so deeply into a person that it was almost frightening.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a single blemish on her face, and every inch of it was amazing. If people saw her, they would feel ashamed simply for being in her presence. They would deem themselves unworthy.\n\nGu Qingcheng was beautiful, but she never used her looks to put pressure on other people. This person now, though, was different. Her divine beauty was naturally suffocating.\n\nOf course, the most oppressive thing about her wasn\u2019t just her looks\u2014it was her scary swordmind.\n\nHan Sen thought he was very good at sword skills. His swordmind could compete with the swordmind of a deified being, after all. But this woman\u2019s swordmind made Han Sen\u2019s swordmind look dim by comparison. It was like comparing a firefly to a bright moon.\n\n\u201cIt is a perfect sword fairy,\u201d Han Sen thought, despite the fact that she was holding a white paper umbrella instead of a sword.\n\n\u201cDo you know what I want to do now?\u201d Suddenly, Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng spoke to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\n\u201cKill you,\u201d the woman said as she looked at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cStop joking around,\u201d Han Sen said. Although he was pretty sure she wasn\u2019t serious, he couldn\u2019t actually discern her emotions or gauge how she was feeling. Regardless, she did have a proud look about her. Han Sen had never witnessed that level of pride before. She was like some goddess perched in a lofty realm, despising the commoners beneath her. Or anyone who was not worthy of being in her presence.\n\nThe woman shook her head and seriously said, \u201cI\u2019m not joking. I really want to kill you. Not just you. I want to kill every living creature in this world. You are all so ugly in my eyes. You are all so imperfect. I cannot accept these imperfections I am forced to witness. I have held it in for so long; stopping myself from killing people.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at her with shock. He realized that she wasn\u2019t joking. Right now, he was in trouble.\n\nPang!\n\nThe woman\u2019s body suddenly split in two. Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng splintered into their separate bodies again. They looked very pale and ill.\n\n\u201cNow you know why you must kill one of us and keep our personalities uncombined. If we are one, things will end up that way. We will have a personality that is untouchable and entirely ruthless. That personality is obsessed with perfection, and it will seek out and destroy all it deems imperfect. We combine very well, but there are dark thoughts deep within our genes that are brought to the surface. We can suppress the slaughterous desires for the moment, but we have no idea what the future may bring,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said.\n\n\u201cSo, if only one personality is alive, we won\u2019t have this problem?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn\u2019t want to become murderous perfectionists. Even if it guaranteed survival, that wasn\u2019t a life that they wanted to lead. They would become a demon that sought the destruction of pretty much everything. The rest of their lives would be one of battle.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of sword fairy is this? It\u2019s just an evil swordswoman.\u201d Han Sen had a wry smile.\n\nLooking at Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng, Han Sen knew he was in trouble. When they combined, they didn\u2019t just have an ugly seek-and-destroy heart: they had a terrifying level of talent that could probably make their sordid wishes come true.\n\nAfter they combined, they were still King class. But after getting a good look at their willpower, it was easy to guess they would one day become deified. At that point, they would become even more frightening.\n\nBoth Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were supremely talented. Even more frightening, they both had super god bodies. When those combined, they would be even more perfect than they were now.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know how the two super god bodies might exist together, but anything was possible.\n\nRegardless of how exactly the combination happened, their talents would make them scarier than any human or spirit that existed. That was an undeniable fact.\n\n\u201cAfter you guys combine, will you two still have your super god bodies?\u201d Han Sen asked the pair.\n\nGu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon nodded. They didn\u2019t speak, but Han Sen knew how scary the confirmation was.\n\nElysian Moon looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand the gravity of the situation now. If we don\u2019t combine, we will die. We estimate we will live no longer than another year. But if we do agree on a combination, the result still isn\u2019t a good one. We might not die, but many others would. We have killed before, but we find the thought of such a pointless, murderous existence to be abhorrent. We don\u2019t want a life based on killing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that won\u2019t happen. Maybe when you do fully combine, that desire to kill will disappear.\u201d Han Sen tried to offer them comforting words.\n\n\u201cThat is impossible,\u201d Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng said at the same time.\n\nThey looked at each other, and then Elysian Moon said, \u201cWe want to live, but we don\u2019t want to become someone like that. So, only one of us can be permitted to live. If a winner doesn\u2019t come about through our battles, then we will allow you to decide. With your involvement, one of us is sure to be a clear victor. You should decide which of us should live.\u201d\n\nHan Sen sat in his chair, unmoving. He hadn\u2019t expected Elysian Moon to say something like this. He was closer to Gu Qingcheng, though. He knew that deep inside of himself, some part of him wished for her to be the one who would live.\n\nBut Elysian Moon wasn\u2019t his enemy. He didn\u2019t want her to die.\n\nHan Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng. Gu Qingcheng nodded. Sadly, he said, \u201cWhy do you have to make me decide this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are the only one capable of killing us, even if we want to fight back. So, this is a decision only you can make,\u201d Elysian Moon said emotionlessly. She said it as if this was none of her business, like she was reading the headline of a particularly boring newspaper.\n\nHan Sen felt a headache coming on. He was very strong, even here. In the sanctuaries, he was more like a god. It turned out, however, that there were problems even a god couldn\u2019t solve.\n\n\u201cThis is harder than choosing between a mother and wife who have fallen into a stream. It is too f*cking hard.\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t help but swear.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just deciding who to save. He was deciding who to murder."
