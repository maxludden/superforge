    "text": "Lando had placed the mark on Han Sen to keep him on a leash, but now he had simply torn the mark off. That told Han Sen how serious of a situation they were in. Lando wasn\u2019t bluffing.\n\nHan Sen had only been hovering there for a short time when the horde of unicorns found him again. They rushed toward him in a crazed mass.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t use his Blood Eye Evil God power this time. Instead, he drew his Ghost Teeth Knife and Thunder God Spike. With them in-hand, he plunged into the field of battle. In a few seconds, he slew a dozen unicorns.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke hunted: White Unicorn. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained White Unicorn beast soul.\u201d\n\nAfter killing a few more unicorns, Han Sen received this beast soul announcement. Han Sen took a quick glance into his Sea of Soul and noticed that it was a mount beast soul. He could use it to travel, but it wouldn\u2019t fight.\n\nIn this situation, using a mount would be pointless. There were too many other unicorns about. Maneuverability was incredibly important right now, and using a mount would be too cumbersome.\n\nThe unicorns came in seven different colors. The colors he had seen thus far included black, white, purple, red, gold, blue, and green. The unicorns of each color were divided into ordinary Dukes, Kings, and half-deifieds. Each color possessed different area powers.\n\nJust like the Demon Bug King Bai Sema that Han Sen used to use, the unicorns\u2019 powers could be overlapped and increased. But while Han Sen\u2019s old shield was a purely defensive bai sema, and the areas of the unicorns could also be used to attack.\n\nHan Sen had to deal with the group of unicorns and fight seven unicorn Kings at the same time. It was a very chaotic fight.\n\nThere were simply too many unicorns. Although Han Sen was able to avoid engaging directly with the unicorn Kings, he had his hands full just killing the lesser unicorns. The blood that flowed in his wake was like a river. Han Sen\u2019s hands soon grew tired.\n\n\u201cF*ck! What is going on?\u201d Han Sen looked over to Lando, who was still fighting that deified unicorn.\n\nHan Sen was so far away that he couldn\u2019t see their battle clearly, though. All he could see was the shifting light of seven colors. He knew the deified unicorn had the upper hand. Lando was having a hard time dealing with the creature\u2019s attacks.\n\n\u201cI hope the legends about him are true, and he can actually take down a deified xenogeneic. If those tales aren\u2019t true, I don\u2019t think he will last very long.\u201d Han Sen gritted his teeth.\n\nWhile Han Sen and Lando fought, a giant turtle hovered above the clouds. That giant turtle was carrying a pavilion upon its back. A Dragon man and a deified of the Destroyed were drinking tea together.\n\nBehind the Dragon man was a female Dragon servant holding a Wanjie Rubix Cube. It was filming Han Sen and Lando\u2019s battle.\n\nEvery person in the geno universe was watching the tremendous fight unfold.\n\n\u201cKlose, it doesn\u2019t look like you are going to win.\u201d The Dragon man sipped tea and smiled at the Destroyed.\n\n\u201cWinning or losing, it\u2019s all the same to me. If I lose, you can have Lando and Han Sen. I won\u2019t get in the way of that. But if you lose, you won\u2019t betray our terms will you, Dragon One?\u201d Klose\u2019s six eyes looked at the Dragon man while he spoke.\n\n\u201cWe Dragon always keep our promises. If Lando and Han Sen can kill all of these unicorns and survive, the Dragon will leave the Tianxia System and cease all involvement in this matter,\u201d Dragon One said firmly.\n\nAlthough the Dragon man was being referred to as Dragon One, he wasn\u2019t the same Dragon One that Han Sen had seen before. This was the Dragon One of a previous generation.\n\n\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s wait for the result.\u201d Klose grabbed his cup of tea and had a sip. He looked rather relaxed.\n\nDragon One could see that Klose didn\u2019t appear worried. He smiled and asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid of Lando being killed by that deified unicorn? If that happens, what will you tell the king of the Destroyed?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is just a servant. If he joins the Extreme King, he knows he might sacrifice his ties to the Destroyed,\u201d Klose said slowly. His face didn\u2019t move a muscle.\n\nAfter that, Klose\u2019s expression became interested. He looked at Dragon One and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the Dragons\u2019 best chance at capturing Lando. If you fail, how will you explain that to the king of the Dragons?\u201d\n\n\u201cLando has to die. You really think he can defeat a deified being all alone?\u201d Dragon One shot back, his tone dripping with derision.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is still there.\u201d Klose laughed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a first-tier King. It doesn\u2019t matter how experienced he might be; he\u2019s no more than a strong ant,\u201d Dragon One growled.\n\nKlose didn\u2019t say anything more. He looked at the Dragon servant holding the Wanjie Rubix Cube and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone as strong and smart as you has decided to use the live stream of the Thousand Treasures Alliance to his advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter the resource, I can find ways to make use of it,\u201d Dragon One said with a chilly smile.\n\nAll the creatures in the geno universe were watching this stream if they had the time.\n\nBut the video that Dragon One was streaming wasn\u2019t as polished as the previous videos that had come from the Treasure Identifier Elder. He didn\u2019t have a professional team to handle the video, so he just played it straight to the broadcasting networks, 1:1 as things happened. There was no editing or clean-up.\n\nSo, many creatures were unable to see that Lando was actually fighting a deified unicorn. They could only see a video of flashing lights. It was like the lights you\u2019d see at the end of the world.\n\nIn Han Sen\u2019s fight, high-level Kings and Dukes were able to make out a bit more. So, most of the Kings, Dukes, and nobles tuned into Han Sen\u2019s battle.\n\nSome powerful elites focused on Lando and his fight against the deified unicorn. They knew that Lando\u2019s performance would determine whether both he and Han Sen lived or died.\n\nBut they also wanted to know more about just how strong Lando truly was. Although Lando had once killed a deified elite, most elites believed there had to be more to the tale. After all, Lando\u2019s teacher wasn\u2019t just an ordinary deified. And the way that Lando slew his teacher indicated that they were missing information.\n\n\u201cThis is too scary. That Han Sen is surrounded by Kings and half-deifieds, and yet he hasn\u2019t lost his advantage. He has killed so many unicorns. He\u2019s even managed to bring down two King unicorns. What impressive power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, really. If he hadn\u2019t been reckless enough to kill an Extreme King prince, he could have become famous across the entire universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Yisha has the most cause to be upset about what has happened. Han Sen\u2019s genes aren\u2019t stable, and yet she actually brought him all the way up to King class. I can\u2019t imagine how many resources and how much effort was spent on him to get that done. But now, it\u2019s all gone. We don\u2019t even know if what Han Sen has done will affect her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYisha is smart. When Han Sen received Kong Fei\u2019s deified feather, many normal elites wanted to adopt him. But Yisha was the one that took him in and brought him up to King class. No one expected Han Sen to become this strong when he reached King. I bet those other elites really regret it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would they be regretting? No matter how strong he is, he\u2019s just a King. Not even a deified could get out of a predicament like this, let alone a King.\u201d"
