    "text": "On the next day, Han Sen brought porns to the soldier who had asked him for them. The soldier was so happy that he wanted to become sworn brothers with Han Sen and said Han Sen would be responsible for his happiness from now on.\n\nHan Sen was covered in sweat. Fortunately, Yang Manli came fast enough so that Han Sen got rid of the soldier successfully.\n\nYang Manli spent half an hour to explain some archery knowledge and gave Han Sen a few tasks to finish on his own.\n\nHan Sen had learned basic archery knowledge at school and what Yang taught him was more practical, which benefited him a lot. Yang was indeed an expert.\n\nThere were a lot of tasks for him to complete, which included the gravity trainer. Han Sen wanted to use the gravity trainer himself. This time he used the protection mechanism to adjust the parameters, not to reduce the gravity, but to increase the gravity a notch so that it suited his real fitness level better.\n\nThe gym did not seem to be the place where ordinary soldiers trained. Han Sen had never seen other soldiers here than the ones he talked to.\n\nDuring lunch break, Han Sen was chatting with the soldiers he knew. The soldier who asked Han Sen for porns regarded Han Sen and asked, \"Sen, in addition to bow and arrows, what other weapons do you use?\"\n\n\"Dagger.\" Han Sen showed him the Z-steel dagger.\n\nHan Sen only knew the nicknames of these soldiers. This guy\u2019s name was \"Gambler.\" Han Sen learned from others that he was greedy and lewd.\n\nGambler took over Han Sen\u2019s dagger and played with it. The dagger seemed like a living thing in his hand, making dazzling moves like a snake.\n\n\"Watch this.\" Gambler held the dagger an inch away from Han Sen\u2019s eyes. With a simple wave of his hand, the dagger disappeared in front of Han Sen and Gambler\u2019s hand was empty.\n\n\"S*#t! Your nickname should be Magician!\" Han Sen looked everywhere and didn\u2019t see the dagger.\n\nGambler laughed and shook his hands in front of Han Sen. He curled his fingers and the dagger returned to his hands magically.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Han Sen widened his eyes.\n\n\"Pretty cool, huh?\" Gambler asked proudly.\n\n\"Yep.\" Han Sen quickly nodded.\n\n\"Dazzling, no?\" Gambler played with the dagger.\n\n\"For sure.\" Han Sen nodded again.\n\n\"Want to learn?\" Gambler looked at Han Sen with a faint smile.\n\n\"I do. Do you want to teach me?\" Han Sen asked.\n\n\"If you can bring me all my girls\u2019 new movies, I will teach you.\" Gambler said with a smile.\n\n\"No problem.\" Han Sen agreed, knowing the girls Gambler referred to were certain porn stars.\n\nAlthough it cost some money to buy new movies, Han Sen really wanted to learn these tricks.\n\n\"Come, we will find a place so that I can show you.\" Gambler took Han Sen aside and told him the key to it.\n\nHan Sen then found out that it was not really magic but finger tricks. Although it was taking advantage of the blind spots, the most important part was one\u2019s control of the muscles on the arm.\n\nYes, it was the entire arm instead of just the hand.\n\nGambler told him that this trick was called \"heaven in sleeves,\" also known as \"Sleeveblade.\" It was passed down in his family as the foundation of their family business. The dirk Gambler used was specially made. Thin and sharp, it had a crescent-like double-edged blade but no hilt.\n\nGambler was playing with one dirk in each hand, and it looked like there were two butterflies dancing around his hands, which was amazing to watch.\n\n\"How long will it take for me to become a master like you?\" Han Sen looked at Gambler enviously.\n\nGambler smiled, \"I started at the age of three, and became better at seven. I\u2019m now intermediate and still far from being a master.\"\n\nHe gave the dagger back to Han Sen and said, \"Do not underestimate this trick. Although it is just lays the foundation, but it is fundamental and will benefit you for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"Gambler, what does your family do?\" Han Sen could not help but ask.\n\n\"Aha, you will never be in our business and I do not intend to let you. I\u2019m just showing you a trick. You could practice it if you think it is fun. Never mind other issues.\" Gambler walked away and turned back to ask Han Sen, \"Have you ever played games on the Skynet?\"\n\n\"Rarely.\" Han Sen had spent all his time trying to survive, and had no time for games.\n\n\"Go play \u2018Hand of God.\u2019 It will help you learn this trick. If you can level up in that game, you will be getting somewhere with this trick.\" Gambler pointed to the holographic training machine.\n\nHan Sen was very interested in Sleeveblade, so he went to check out Hand of God on the holographic training machine. Soon he understood why Gambler asked him to play this game.\n\nThis was a holographic game. Its idea was like Whack-a-Mole, but instead of using fingers alone, the spots to touch could appear everywhere around one\u2019s arms. One must use all muscles rationally to hit all the spots to pass a level. It was highly demanding for one\u2019s dexterity and accuracy.\n\nIn addition to the beginner level, the game was divided into three levels: evolver, surpass and demigod.\n\nThe intention of the classification was obviously to correspond with the three phases of God\u2019s Sanctuary, and to guide players to choose the right level.\n\nHan Sen first chose the beginner level. Actually, when Gambler said \"level up,\" he meant to clear the beginner level. As for which level Gambler himself was in, Han Sen had no way of knowing.\n\nSoon, Han Sen was hooked. He was not that smooth in the beginning, but was soon addicted to the satisfaction gained from hitting rapidly as he got familiar with the game.\n\n\"Faster, faster, faster...\" Once started, the game would push one to pursue the exhilaration in speeding up.\n\nBut Han Sen did not have much time to play this game. After a few rounds in the martial arts contest, Han Sen reached the final match as expected.\n\nNot sure it was good luck or bad luck, Han Sen didn\u2019t encounter either Fist Guy or Son of Heaven. Son of Heaven had eliminated Fist Guy, and Qin Xuan had eliminated Son of Heaven. The final match was between Qin Xuan and Han Sen.\n\nIn fact, Han Sen wanted to fight Son of Heaven more, so that he would have the opportunity to kill Son of Heaven on the stage. Usually the young master was surrounded by many strong men and there was almost no chance for Han Sen to approach him."
