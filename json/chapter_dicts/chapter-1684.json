    "text": "Crash!\n\nHan Sen hit the ground hard, writhing around as if his bones were about to snap. He felt sure that the composition of his body had become softer.\n\nHe set a hand on the floor to pick himself up and noticed that he was lying on something very soft. It gave him a shock. He heard a scream, and he jumped up and away from the noise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Han Sen and another voice spoke the same line at the same time.\n\nHan Sen looked at the floor. There was a red, fox-like cat standing there. It was the Nine-Life Cat.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t seen the Nine-Life Cat since he left the last time. Han Sen didn\u2019t expect to see him again, especially under these conditions.\n\n\u201cNo way! The Nine-Life Cat should be in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. I have already leveled up to the Alliance, so why am I seeing it here? Did it ascend, as well?\u201d\n\nNine-Life Cat looked at him with shock and confusion.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Again, they spoke the same line at the exact same time.\n\nHan Sen pointed at the Nine-Life Cat tattoo on his back and said, \u201cThis brought me here, I think?\u201d\n\nNine-Life Cat looked at Han Sen, but it could not see the tattoo he was referencing. Han Sen turned around so the cat could see the tattoo. The shock on the Nine-Life Cat\u2019s face deepened.\n\n\u201cIs this a bad thing?\u201d Han Sen asked with worry.\n\nNine-Life Cat walked closer to Han Sen and checked his tattoo out Then, he jumped on his shoulder, touching the tattoo. \u201cWhat is it? Say something!\u201d Han Sen demanded when the Nine-Life Cat remained silent.\n\nNine-Life Cat jumped off of Han Sen\u2019s shoulder and then leaped atop a tablet, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. But if you go out, people will think you are a part of Nine-Life Cat\u201d\n\n\u201cGo out where?\u201d Han Sen asked without thinking.\n\nBut then Han Sen realized what the cat was implying. He looked at Nine-Life Cat, and if going out meant what he now had in mind, it really was quite shocking.\n\nNine-Life Cat gave him a very human-like smile, and he said, \u201cAh, you won\u2019t understand. You can\u2019t get out of here, anyway.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean getting out of the sanctuary?\u201d Han Sen still wanted to ask.\n\nNine-Life Cat looked surprised, but he didn\u2019t answer. He just used one of his paws to scratch his side as he repeated himself. \u201cYou can\u2019t get out of here, anyway. It doesn\u2019t really matter for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust in case I need to know, you should tell me!\u201d Han Sen wanted to punch the kitty to get him to answer the question.\n\nNine-Life Cat laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m just saying that Nine-Life Cat does not have a good reputation out there. If you are lucky enough to get out, just don\u2019t let anyone else see your tattoo. If it gets you killed, don\u2019t take it out on me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart sank. \u201cCan I remove it?\u201d\n\nNine-Life Cat rolled his eyes. \u201cIt has merged with your body. It\u2019s a part of you! You really think it\u2019s possible to remove something like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine! Cut the crap!\u201d Han Sen yelled. That was not the answer he had been hoping for. \u201cI\u2019m busy, and I\u2019m running out of time and patience.\u201d\n\nNine-Life Cat jumped off of the tablet and started walking in another direction. Han Sen noticed that they appeared to be in some sort of graveyard. The tablet Nine-Life Cat was sitting atop was a headstone.\n\nBehind the stone there was another one, half-covered by patches of grass. Surprisingly, the grave was smaller than the sort you might expect to see for a human.\n\nHe looked at the headstone, but he was unsure of what it was dated. All the text across its surface was faded. Some very light markings were visible, but what they meant, he hadn\u2019t a clue.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Follow me!\u201d Nine-Life Cat gazed back at Han Sen with a look of annoyance.\n\nHan Sen followed as he was bid to, and they walked past many headstones. They were all in various states of decay, so he couldn\u2019t learn much about where he was.\n\n\u201cWhat is this place? Some kind of old graveyard?\u201d Han Sen asked Nine-Life Cat after catching up with him.\n\nNine-Life Cat smiled and said, \u201cThis is the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. We\u2019re not in the Alliance.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Han Sen had thought, but when it was confirmed, he really was given a shock. \u201cNo way! This is the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary? I thought after you go to the Alliance, you aren\u2019t allowed to come back. And why is my body not being harmed by being here?\u201d\n\nNine-Life Cat used his claws to point at Han Sen\u2019s new tattoo and laughed. \u201cWith this tattoo, it\u2019s not only the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary you can return to. If you want, you can hop back into the First God\u2019s Sanctuary. Why? Because now you are a part of Nine-Life Cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is Nine-Life Cat exactly?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen was curious about this. He only knew that it had some connection to the elusive Human Emperor and that the Nine-Life Cat was some sort of a mascot for Blood Legion. It was like a representative symbol.\n\nHan Sen thought Nine-Life Cat might have been a strong creature that followed Human Emperor. But all things considered, that no longer seemed likely. Nine-Life Cat, whatever it was, was bigger than what he was thinking. It looked like it was even connected to some pretty big things beyond the sanctuaries.\n\nBut now Han Sen remembered people had told him that Human Emperor took Nine-Life Cat as something serious. Han Sen didn\u2019t care for it very much, but now, things obviously weren\u2019t so simple.\n\n\u201cI told you that you wouldn\u2019t understand. If you can get out, though, you will know.\u201d Nine-Life Cat did not want to talk about this much.\n\nHan Sen wanted to ask some more, but Nine-Life Cat suddenly stopped moving.\n\nHan Sen saw a headstone marking a grave. It was similar to the other tablets, though, in which the words had all faded away.\n\n\u201cSince you are here, help me dig this grave up.\u201d Nine-Life Cat pointed at the small, grass-laden headstone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re digging up graves now? This is horrible! You can do that yourself!\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nHan Sen did not know what the kitty wanted, and there was a chance that the creature would put him in danger. Whatever the case might have been, he wasn\u2019t quite willing to risk it.\n\nNine-Life Cat rolled his eyes and jumped atop the grave. With his little paws, he started to dig. He told Han Sen, \u201cFine! You don\u2019t have to dig, but as for the special item that might reside below, you will have nothing to do with it!\u201d"
