    "text": "Now Han Sen knew another reason that Lando hadn\u2019t tied him up. Lando knew that the way back to the Extreme King wouldn\u2019t be safe. If he had to hold onto Han Sen in a fight, it would be too much trouble.\n\nLetting Han Sen run off on his own would allow Lando to focus his attention on whoever was attacking them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very calculating, but you\u2019ve underestimated me. I am Han Sen! You think a mere tracking mark can beat me?\u201d Han Sen laughed sinisterly, but he didn\u2019t stick around to gloat. He ran off in the opposite direction.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long into his escape attempt that he saw a group of gold unicorns coming at him from another cloud. They were everywhere. And there were as many of these gold ones as there were white unicorns the other way.\n\n\u201cOh sh*t! Why are there so many xenogeneics?\u201d Han Sen drew his knife and ran straight into the unicorn herd. The sword lights flashed. Blood was everywhere. He immediately killed a few unicorns.\n\n\u201cXenogeneic Duke hunted. Xenogeneic gene found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey really are xenogeneics!\u201d Han Sen kept pushing through the enormous herd of unicorns, massacring them as he went. His Ghost Teeth Knife cut them down like a scythe through a wheat field. But he wasn\u2019t harvesting wheat. He was harvesting lives.\n\nThe unicorns didn\u2019t relent. Han Sen kept slicing and dicing, and blood splashed all around him. He killed countless unicorns in no time at all.\n\nHan Sen suddenly heard a long scream. A glowing unicorn stepped through the herd. It was twice as large as the ordinary gold unicorns, and its horn was pure gold as well. It was thundering toward Han Sen, and its body seemed to strain the space around it as it ran.\n\nHan Sen slashed at the unicorn\u2019s horn. The blade and the horn collided with a metallic shriek. Han Sen bounced away a few hundred meters before coming to a stop.\n\nBefore Han Sen restabilized, he saw another unicorn coming for him. This next one was black, and it radiated a terrifying amount of power. It was no weaker than the enormous gold unicorn.\n\nHan Sen sent a punch toward the black unicorn. The ice light landed on the black unicorn, but the creature shone with a black light. It was as if a shield manifested, blooming from the tip of the creature\u2019s horn. It was shaped like a spindle.\n\nThe ice light, when it touched down on the shield, was ricocheted away. It had been completely unable to pierce the fusiform area the creature had created.\n\nPang!\n\nThe black unicorn smashed into Han Sen\u2019s body, breaking him in two. He turned into dust, but then his real body reappeared on the other side of the field of battle. As he turned, he saw another large unicorn coming for him. This one was a stark white.\n\n\u201cOh sh*t! Why are the white unicorns coming for me, as well? Isn\u2019t Lando over there?\u201d He began to wonder if Lando had played a trick on him.\n\nBut when he looked closer, he saw Lando engaged in combat with a rainbow-colored unicorn. The rainbow-colored unicorn was emitting a rainbow-colored godlight. But as he watched the light shimmer and warp reality around it, he knew that it was a deified unicorn.\n\n\u201cHow unlucky am I to encounter this deified xenogeneic?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed. Even Lando wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a deified xenogeneic. It seemed as if the situation was going from bad to worse.\n\nSince the rest of the unicorns couldn\u2019t get anywhere close to the fight between Lando and the deified unicorn, they came for Han Sen instead. Han Sen had already encountered four half-deified unicorns, and now there was an entire ocean of lesser unicorns coming after him. If Han Sen stayed to fight, he\u2019d wear his hand down to nubs even if the unicorns lined up so he could kill them one by one.\n\nWhen a red unicorn also began running toward him, Han Sen had an idea. His left eye flashed with red. He turned into a bloody shadow and hopped into the red unicorn\u2019s eyes.\n\nLosing their target in the blink of an eye left all the unicorns shocked and confused. They looked around, trying to find Han Sen, but none of them could figure out where he had gone.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t stop in the eye of the red unicorn, though. He immediately teleported into the eye of another unicorn. He kept bouncing through the herd of unicorns, never staying in any particular host for more than a second.\n\nAlthough four of the unicorns were half-deified, Han Sen wasn\u2019t really scared of them. What unsettled him was the strange timing of the unicorns\u2019 arrival. Han Sen felt like there were larger forces at work here, forces that he hadn\u2019t yet identified.\n\nHe kept moving through the unicorn herd, flickering between the eyes of the beasts. By doing this, he was able to inch his way to the edge of the battleground. He kept watch over the unicorns as he moved, trying to discern what had inspired their sudden attack, but he still hadn\u2019t noticed anything out of place.\n\n\u201cDid I overthink this? I guess their attack was a good thing, all in all. At least this way, I can escape Lando. He\u2019s still trying to fight that deified unicorn and all the rest. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it. Even if he does make it out, he won\u2019t be able to catch me again,\u201d Han Sen thought. By this time, he had made it to the edge of the unicorn horde. He came out of the eye of the furthest one and tried to fly away unnoticed.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had run face-first into a steel board. He reeled back, his nose weeping blood.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Han Sen looked forward but he couldn\u2019t see anything. He reached out his hand to touch whatever he had crashed into, and he realized it was some sort of invisible shield.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong here.\u201d Han Sen touched the invisible shield. His body flew up a few hundred miles, but his hands kept in contact with the shield. There was no end to it.\n\nHan Sen traveled another thousand miles, but there was no sign that the invisible shield would end anytime soon. He had no idea how far it went.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Who is doing this?\u201d Han Sen was shocked. If that shield covered the entire battleground, then that meant there had to be an additional deified being who was pulling strings in this battle. Only someone of that level could create a shield so strong and large.\n\nHan Sen opened his Dongxuan Aura and used the purple butterfly in his right eye to see if he could discern more about the invisible shield.\n\nHe immediately saw that the thing prohibiting his passage was an invisible substance chain wall. He looked ahead and saw that the wall surrounded the entire area. There was no end to it.\n\n\u201cThere really is a deified elite behind all this.\u201d Han Sen took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t understand why the deified elite hadn\u2019t revealed itself and fought. He only knew that the deified had locked down the battleground, and now, Han Sen couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nSuddenly, Han Sen\u2019s left finger grew hot. A beam of grey light emerged from his finger, glowing from the symbol painted on to one of his metacarpals.\n\nThe mark seemed to fade away from his finger, and the grey light formed the image of Lando in front of him.\n\n\u201cStop running. This place has been locked down by a deified elite. We need to kill every xenogeneic here. Otherwise, we die,\u201d said the mark that had turned into the shadow of Lando.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\n\u201cThere is no why. We simply aren\u2019t strong enough to have any other options. I may not like this, but someone is using us as chess pieces right now.\u201d Lando\u2019s shadow slowly disappeared. It seemed as if the power was extinguished."
