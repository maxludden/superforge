    "text": "The Star Gauge Mirror wasn\u2019t useful for him, but its power was excellent nonetheless. It could rewind time, and that power alone made it exceedingly overpowered.\n\nHowever, Empty God and the many gods like him were always\u2026 economical with the truth. The power of the Star Gauge Mirror wasn\u2019t a lie, but there were limitations to what it could present. Normal people couldn\u2019t use the mirror on a whim as Empty God could.\n\nOf course, Empty God wasn\u2019t going to mention that to Bao\u2019er. He would only let Bao\u2019er see how amazing the Star Gauge Mirror was in his own hands.\n\nEmpty God studied Bao\u2019er\u2019s face as he showed off the mirror, hoping that she might exhibit some surprise. Bao\u2019er\u2019s eyes did widen as she watched the image playing across the Star Gauge Mirror, but after watching it for a while, she was confused. She said, \u201cUncle, this power\u2014in my home\u2014can be achieved through something called a camcorder. We have many items that can showcase the past, like datapads and phones. There are also holograms and other similar gadgets. If you like them that much, then when we head into civilization, I will ask my father to get you the best camcorder money can buy. It will be much prettier than this one. The picture will be much clearer, too. Think of it as a gift for giving me this gem.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er looked at him as if she was looking at someone who was very out-of-touch with the modern world. Empty God felt a muscle in his cheek twitch.\n\nHe wanted nothing more than to murder Bao\u2019er right there, but he held in his rage. Empty God was being very slow and patient. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a camcorder. You can rewind time. It can show you anything that happened in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d Bao\u2019er tilted her head, looking confused.\n\nEmpty God opened his mouth to explain, but then he realized that it might be too hard of a concept for a child to understand. Time travel was a complicated subject, and explaining the difference between that and using a camcorder to record past events might be too difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is fine if you\u2019re not interested in this power. Star Gauge Mirror has a stronger ability.\u201d Empty God was having trouble reasoning with this child, so he went for a more exciting aspect of Star Gauge Mirror to win her over.\n\nEmpty God spun the compass-like dial on the back of the Star Gauge Mirror, and the item began to shine with a wavering light.\n\nMoments later, the mirror was displaying a different image. The Star Tree stood in the center of the picture again, but there were no Star Beetles and neither was there Han Sen.\n\nIn the video, there was a man who had a human body and a lion head. He was picking Star Fruit.\n\nBut this time, the video was very short. The man picked fruit for a few seconds, and then the video vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked with confusion.\n\nAfter striking a pose that was both mystical and aloof, Empty God answered, \u201cThis is the true power of the Star Gauge Mirror. It reveals the future. The footage you have just seen is something that will happen in the near future. There will be a creature like the one you saw coming to collect Star Fruit soon. Everything you see in this mirror is the truth. It will come to pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle, are you a movie director?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at Empty God. She blinked, looking curious.\n\nA muscle in Empty God\u2019s cheek spasmed. He suppressed his urge to kill the d*mn kid, and answered her, \u201cDirector? I didn\u2019t hire people to film this. I don\u2019t know who this creature is. This is the Star Gauge Mirror showing you what will happen in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, it can see the future? Its power is that magical?\u201d Bao\u2019er finally looked surprised. She stared at the Star Gauge Mirror in wide-eyed disbelief.\n\nSeeing Bao\u2019er\u2019s face, Empty God finally felt a bit better. He laughed and said, \u201cThis is one of the best true god items in existence. There is no other like it in the whole universe. Just say you want it, and I can give it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Uncle? You are such a good man.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at Empty God with surprise.\n\n\u201cYou want it?\u201d Empty God extended the Star Gauge Mirror, holding it out in front of Bao\u2019er. But this time, he reassured himself that he wouldn\u2019t let her touch the mirror before she made a wish, just in case something embarrassing happened.\n\nBao\u2019er opened her mouth. Judging from the expression on her face, it definitely seemed that she was about to express her desire for the mirror. This filled Empty God with joy. If Bao\u2019er spoke the three words \u201cI want it,\u201d then she would be making a wish to him.\n\nThen, he would gain control of her. And in regards to the Star Gauge Mirror, he would no longer have to give it to her. There were many explanations for making someone\u2019s wish come true, and Empty God already had several different excuses ready for use.\n\nBut after Bao\u2019er opened her little mouth, she didn\u2019t say anything. She seemed to suddenly think of something, and she shut her mouth quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Empty God demanded, his heart sinking. Being forced to wait like this was like having an itch that he couldn\u2019t scratch.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s face looked a little excited. She thought of something good and almost burst out laughing. Empty God looked at Bao\u2019er with confusion. He did not know what was so funny about this situation. It made him feel as if something was going on that he was completely oblivious to.\n\n\u201cUncle, this mirror can predict the future. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, gripping her hands excitedly into fists.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Empty God said with a nod.\n\n\u201cIn that case, it can predict the lottery numbers of the next universal lottery, right? It can win me prizes.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at Empty God with excitement.\n\nMany races had lotteries, so Empty God was familiar with the concept. The most famous of those universal lotteries was operated by the Thousand Treasures.\n\nThe lottery tickets were cheap, but if someone won the top prize, they would earn billions of Thousand Treasures\u2019 coins.\n\nHow much money was a billion of those coins? It would be enough to purchase a low-level deified treasure straight from the Thousand Treasures.\n\nRight now, the universal lottery\u2019s price had gone up to a billion. Whoever won the prize could get all that money without paying any taxes.\n\nThroughout the years, many creatures had made wishes to Empty God concerning the universal lottery, and Empty God had various ways of getting them the jackpot. However, Star Gauge Mirror didn\u2019t have this function. The Star Gauge Mirror could only predict things that would happen in the specific location that it was used. In addition, the snippets of the future that it revealed were random. The user couldn\u2019t choose how far into the future they wanted to look.\n\nEmpty God had no way of adding a power like this to the Star Gauge Mirror, so he was rendered speechless.\n\n\u201cUncle, have you never heard of the Big Universe lottery? It is a small card with numbers on it. If you win the prize, you can buy lots and lots and lots of food and clothes.\u201d Bao\u2019er thought Empty God might not know about the universal lottery, so she tried to explain how it worked.\n\n\u201cStar Gauge Mirror is a true god item. It has too much dignity to be used on something so lame,\u201d Empty God said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked disappointed. Then, she thought of something and asked, \u201cCan it predict what will happen after book seven of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove? Can I see that before it comes out?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Empty God seemed entirely befuddled.\n\n\u201cIt is the work of a very famous comic author. He has a comic that is so good, but the author writes so slowly. There have only been seven books. I want to see what happens next. Can Star Gauge Mirror predict it?\u201d Bao\u2019er looked at Empty God hopefully.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Empty God\u2019s head was full of black lines. Star Gauge Mirror couldn\u2019t do this. Even if the mirror could reveal the author working on his next comic, it wouldn\u2019t show much. Even in a best-case scenario, Bao\u2019er would get only a glance at the work."
