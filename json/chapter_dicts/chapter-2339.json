He had thought that the king tree was giving out words that would improve Bai Qing Xia\u2019s genes, but seeing this, there was a possibility that he had misunderstood.\n\nWhen the word meaning Evil went into him, Bai Qing Xia\u2019s body started to look evil. It completely went against his style.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the king tree only detects what is special about Bai Qing Xia. Whether the thing hidden inside him is good or bad, the tree makes it stronger. And even flaws can be strengthened.\u201d Han Sen now understood how the king tree distributed its words.\n\nSeeing the word Evil appear, the royal children didn\u2019t show much of a reaction. Many of the royal children had received the same symbol, and even so, they were able to become king. So, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAfter the word Evil blended into the man, the leaves of the king tree remained lit. Another Kingese symbol drifted down from the king tree. It was headed for Bai Qing Xia\u2019s forehead once more.\n\nSeeing that word, Bai Ling Shuang screamed and said, \u201cNi!\u201d\n\nBai Ling Shuang wasn\u2019t the only person having such a reaction. Even Miss Mirror, using her mirror to watch the events, stood up. Her eyes opened up wide, looking at the word Betrayal.\n\nThat word Ni didn\u2019t have a thunderous presence or a shocking atmosphere. It barely glowed. The small light it had looked as if it would be extinguished any second.\n\nBut that word made every prince and princess scream. They weren\u2019t shocked that Bai Qing Xia had obtained eleven Kingese; they were merely shocked by the word Betrayal.\n\nThere were countless Kingese symbols. The number of words that descended tended to show the talent of the person obtaining them. But different Kingese symbols meant different things.\n\nIt was impossible to say which words were good and which ones were bad. But some words across history had been known to prove how great an individual was.\n\nOne such example was the word Betrayal. The second king of the Extreme King, King Wen, had received the word Betrayal.\n\nThat was the only word he received. Compared to all those other royals, he was at the bottom of the list. But King Wen beat out all the other talented royal children to become the second king of the Extreme King. He also became one of the most famous kings in their history.\n\nBack then, there was a rare prince that managed to receive twenty-one words. But he lost to King Wen, who only had one word.\n\nAfter King Wen, there were seventy more kings, and countless princes and princesses. But no one else had received the word Betrayal.\n\nRight now, Bai Qing Xia had received the word Betrayal, which shook the royal children. That word made it clear that Bai Qing Xia was indeed a very special person. This was in addition to the ten words he had received before.\n\nEveryone was so shocked. Their mouths were opened wide, looking at Bai Qing Xia in utter shock. They couldn\u2019t even speak.\n\n\u201cHe was so quiet at one point, but now he is suddenly shocking everyone. Prince Seventeen will be famous all around the universe.\u201d One of the guards sighed.\n\nAfter the word Betrayal appeared, there were no more Kingese symbols. Bai Qing Xia\u2019s power went dim. He released his king body and told Han Sen, \u201cBrother Sixteen! I received eleven words, so it is now your turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your king body\u2019s name?\u201d Han Sen gave the man a haughty look. He knew what it was, but he pretended he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cGenzo King Body,\u201d Bai Qing Xia said calmly. He didn\u2019t rise to Han Sen\u2019s provocation.\n\n\u201cYour Genzo King Body isn\u2019t too bad if it obtained eleven Kingese,\u201d Han Sen said casually. It sounded like he was trying to comfort the other prince.\n\n\u201cHa! This guy is so arrogant. If he cannot get a word, what is he going to do?\u201d Hearing Han Sen say that, Miss Mirror couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n\nAll the princes and princesses were shocked to hear this. Although they already knew that Bai Yi was the arrogant sort, they didn\u2019t know his arrogance came along with a whole heap of ignorance, too.\n\n\u201cDoes he not know what it means to get eleven Kingese symbols? Does he not know what Betrayal means?\u201d Prince Nineteen held his face in his hands. He was speechless.\n\nBai Canglang laughed. \u201cOld Sixteen is grumpy. He surely has a little bi-polar disorder. He never had a chance of being anyone important, so it\u2019s not strange that he\u2019s ignorant of what Betrayal means. But no matter how dumb he is, he should know what having eleven Kingese means. He is probably just being stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know how this guy managed to claim the alpha statue.\u201d That was still a sore spot for Prince Nineteen, it seemed.\n\nPrince Nineteen had been to the Pavilion many times. He had wanted to keep coming until he claimed the alpha statue, but he had repeatedly failed. He couldn\u2019t believe the alpha statue was actually claimed by that Bai Yi, who he had always looked down upon. He hated him. He hated Bai Yi, who was actually Han Sen in disguise.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how many Kingese he gets. It will be funny if he is unable to get any.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say. After all, he did manage to claim the alpha statue. There is no way he\u2019ll leave without a single one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows? Maybe getting the alpha statue was pure, dumb luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen do you think he will receive the word Luck?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\nMany guards and royal children were watching intently. Han Sen\u2019s eyes looked up at that tree that looked like a golden sky. He was looking at the Kingese symbols while he mumbled, \u201cGive me a pretty man\u2026 Handsome man\u2026 Whatever it is\u2026 I do not want much\u2026 With my face\u2026 I should get a word like Fan, just as Bai Qing Xia did.\u201d\n\nWhile he was mumbling, Han Sen activated his Original Water King Body. His body became a blob of water, and even his armor became water. He was like a water man standing atop the dragon\u2019s head. He was looking up at the gold sky.\n\nBai Yi\u2019s personality was a grumpy one. He often started arguments. Everyone there had seen his Original Water King Body before, and so it was nothing surprising.\n\nCompared to Bai Qing Xia\u2019s Genzo King Body, the Original Water King Body wasn\u2019t bad. But water was weak. It was better suited to healing abilities.\n\nBut Bai Yi was too ill-tempered. He didn\u2019t want to learn a healing geno art. He had forced himself to learn a destructive water element skill instead, so he hadn\u2019t achieved much. He wasn\u2019t the number one compared to all those King class princes. He was in a medium-low bracket. Because of that, many of the royal children thought his Original Water King Body was rather weak.\n\nIn reality, the Original Water King Body wasn\u2019t much worse than the Genzo King Body. Bai Yi had just never used it well.\n\nHan Sen activated the Original Water King Body, and his body took on a water light. It connected with the king tree. The leaves rustled, and amidst their golden lights, a king leaf shone. The Kingese symbol was like a sun falling down. It was going to Han Sen.\n\nThat word was so watery, it looked like floating water. It looked like a scary wave. It was very pretty, and there was a heavy rain and a storm going with it. It possessed the word Shui.\n\nBai Yi received the word meaning water. Everyone expected this since he had the Original Water King Body. It would be weird if he didn\u2019t receive water.\n\n\u201cIt is better than nothing,\u201d Han Sen thought. And so, he waited for the word to come down and touch his head.\n\nAs the word water was about to touch down on his head, Han Sen prepared to claim the Kingese power. But the word stopped one centimeter above his forehead."
