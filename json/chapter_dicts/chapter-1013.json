Before the group of travelers also continued their journey, they gathered up the carcasses of the slain wolf kings, and a few mutant ones, to take with them.\n\nThey traveled with greater care from then on, but met no more resistance from the forest\u2019s occupants. Four days later, they found the other end of that place.\n\nWhen it was time for supper, nobody touched the meat of the wolf kings. They only dined on the mutant flesh.\n\nHan Sen offered for them to eat whatever they desired, but Chen Hu told him, \u201cYou saved our hides multiple times back there. These wolf kings were slain by your hands only. How could we ever have the audacity to eat your food, on top of what you have already done for us?\u201d\n\nIt was a nice gesture, but Han Sen didn\u2019t really care much for the meat. He could now kill sacred-blood creatures whenever he desired. And besides, with the size of those wolves, it\u2019d most likely take him an entire month to eat them. If they didn\u2019t want to eat them, though, he wasn\u2019t going to push it.\n\nDespite leaving the lightning forest behind, they were still on Ghost Mountain. They reached a valley, eventually, where a rapid river rushed through.\n\nWhile they held a discussion about which way to proceed, they espied the presence of a turtle riding the stream. On its back was a human.\n\n\u201cIs that a human or a spirit?\u201d Lin He asked Han Sen, who was now regarded as their boss.\n\nHan Sen was able to tell them. The turtle was a sacred-blood creature, and the man atop was indeed human. He could tell that the man had greater strength than the creature he was using as a surfboard.\n\nSeeing a human riding a creature in such a manner was a little strange, Han Sen thought.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s human,\u201d Han Sen said as he watched the man.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean there might be a human shelter nearby?\u201d Chen Hu\u2019s excitement flared up.\n\nThey had managed to get through the lightning forest unscathed, though not for lack of effort on the part of the wolves. But they still wondered why they had been let go, when the super creature showed up and looked likely to attack.\n\nWhatever had occurred, the timing of the wolves\u2019 withdraw was impeccable. And they did not think such good fortune could arise again.\n\nThe man on the turtle saw the collective watching him, and he decided to approach. When he got closer, he said, \u201cUncle San and Weiwei; long time no see!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know this man?\u201d Chen Hu asked.\n\nLin Weiwei nodded and said, \u201cYes, this is Liu Yuxuan from Baojin Mining. He has been in the Third God\u2019s Shelter for only six years, and in that time, he has already opened eight gene locks. He is a genius, and I can\u2019t say I expected him to be here on Ghost Mountain.\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan quickly started a discussion with them, while ignoring all the others.\n\n\u201cTell me, Weiwei; what brings you here? This place is dangerous, even for mighty elites such as myself,\u201d Liu Yuxuan spoke smugly.\n\nLiu Yuxuan was hitting on Lin Weiwei, that much was obvious.\n\nAfter the question, Lin Weiwei explained to him the events that had transpired and put them on their present course. Then, she asked, \u201cIs there a human shelter in the nearby vicinity?\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan shook his head and said, \u201cHumans cannot dream of owning a shelter anywhere near this wretched place. There is a king-class shelter, mind you. But it is owned by a spirit, one with whom I signed a contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Liu, can you tell us which direction we might be able to go to escape this place?\u201d People did not think poorly of him for being the slave of a spirit. It was far more common for humans to sign contracts with spirits in the Third God\u2019s Shelter, than to have absolute freedom with those of your own kind. Survival was the name of the game, after all.\n\nLiu Yuxuan shook his head and said, \u201cYou wish to escape this place? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. I\u2019m surprised to see you haven\u2019t been eaten by the wolf king yet, but that\u2019s not the only super creature you should be worrying about. There are quite a few populating this mountain, and to escape their notice will be quite the task. An impossible one.\u201d Liu Yuxuan paused for a moment, and then went on to say, \u201cWeiwei, why don\u2019t you and your fellows come with me? I\u2019m a valued member of the king spirit shelter, and I can vouch for you all. You will be safe there.\u201d\n\nLin Weiwei frowned. Going there would only reduce their chances of escaping that mountain.\n\nThey had risked everything and lost so much, all in the name of maintaining a hold on their freedom. Going into the service of a spirit would be like throwing in the towel, and it wouldn\u2019t feel right submitting now.\n\nLiu Yuxuan looked at Lin He and made an offer, \u201cUncle San, I believe you are well aware of the dangers this mountain poses. Even our king spirit master would not lurk in the territories ruled by the super creatures of this place. If you come with me, I can assure you that you will be treated well.\u201d\n\nLin He turned around and asked, \u201cWhat do you think, Little Han?\u201d\n\nLiu Yuxuan saw Lin He ask Han Sen, and thought it strange. He looked at the young man a little more closely, as he had initially believed him to be another random nobody.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Liu Yuxuan asked Lin He.\n\nLin He introduced Han Sen by saying, \u201cThis is President Ji\u2019s son-in-law, Han Sen. We joined forces on the slopes of this mountain, after a chance encounter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard of him before, yes. I never expected the name Han Sen to be the label of a young boy such as yourself.\u201d Liu Yuxuan feigned politeness, but the ignorance behind his words was clear to hear.\n\nAfter smirking at Liu Yuxuan for a second, Han Sen turned to face Lin He and answered his question. \u201cI\u2019m not seeking employment with any spirit. I still want to leave this mountain of my own accord.\u201d\n\nHan Sen would sooner die than submit to slavery under some spirit. If anything, he would be a slave-driver of spirits.\n\nOf course, Han Sen knew his powers weren\u2019t the best they could be. What\u2019s more, the instability and imbalance of his powers could be problematic. He didn\u2019t have what it took to conquer a king spirit shelter just yet.\n\n( )\n\nLiu Yuxuan looked at Han Sen with disdain and said, \u201cPah! A typical noob outlook on things. I\u2019m afraid you have yet to learn the way things go in this sanctuary, and how powerful the spirits of this place truly are. Without the power and support of many, you aren\u2019t likely to last out there. Folks who fly solo never last, and even a person such as I, with eight gene locks open, knows it\u2019s better to get along with spirits than to fight them.\u201d"
