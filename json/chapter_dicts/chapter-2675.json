    "text": "\u201cThat isn\u2019t the entirety of his power. His physical strength is just one aspect of his abilities. He isn\u2019t some brainless creature that is tossing his entire strength into this fight,\u201d Shale said.\n\n\u201cDo you think you will still be able to defeat him?\u201d the Fox woman looked at Shale with interest.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d Shale looked the same as he always did when saying this.\n\nThe four half-deifieds had no idea what to do. They were all fighting Han Sen, but they couldn\u2019t beat him. And on top of that, he was gaining the upper hand.\n\nThey were the best of the half-deifieds, and they all possessed remarkable power. Normally, they could go toe-to-toe with any half-deified in the universe. Now, however, they were losing a four on one fight. And their opponent was only a ninth-tier King. To say they were shocked would be an understatement.\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite were in shock, as well. They could feel Han Sen\u2019s strength. They could also experience what it was like to be in his shoes, fighting in the way he was.\n\nThe strange thing was that Han Sen had no interest in simply fighting with his geno arts and his body. It was more like he was playing a game of chess. Watching him play was easy, and each individual move was simple. Yet assembling all those moves together to replicate his overall strategy would be very difficult. You still had to practice it yourself.\n\n\u201cThis method of fighting is quite similar to the Very High Sense, but Han Sen has only learned Under the Sky. He hasn\u2019t even read the whole of the Textless Book, and yet, he can do all this. His talent is scary to behold,\u201d Li Keer said.\n\nExquisite nodded with glee and said, \u201cThis is a good thing. This will actually help us develop our proficiency with the Very High Sense. This is something other silkworms can never do.\u201d\n\nPang!\n\nA bullet struck the arm of the mantis-man and exploded with the scary power of Break Six Skies. It blew the mantis-man away. Even his exoskeleton was covered in cracks, and blood started to seep out of them.\n\nThese four weren\u2019t like Gru; there were flaws in how they fought. Han Sen finally found an opportunity to create a distance between him and his enemies. His Spell pistols began to fire without reprieve.\n\nFor most of the fight, Han Sen had been too close to them to use Break Six Skies. He had been afraid he would blow himself up, so he used less destructive geno arts to fuel his bullets. But now that he had some distance, he no longer had to worry about injuring himself.\n\nThe bullet was fired. A scary power exploded close to the four half-deifieds. They threw their arms over their heads and ran away like rats. They no longer dared to get close to Han Sen.\n\nA bullet infused with the power of Break Six Skies wasn\u2019t something they would risk trying to withstand. They didn\u2019t dare to continue the fight now. They ran as fast as they could, trying to leave the radius from which Han Sen could attack them.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t pursue them, though. He waited until they were far enough away, then put his hands together. He combined the two Spell pistols and transformed them into a sniper rifle.\n\nHan Sen raised the gun and took aim at the mantis-man. He pulled the trigger.\n\nPang!\n\nA bullet flew through the air, and the mantis-man felt the power coming toward him. He knew he couldn\u2019t use his arms to block it.\n\nHe had only been able to use his mantis arm to repel Han Sen\u2019s power earlier due to the boons provided by the Extreme King area. But now, all of his allies had fled the scene. None of them dared to fight Han Sen without the buffs and boons of each other\u2019s areas.\n\nWings suddenly spread from the mantis-man\u2019s back, taking him a kilometer away in an instant. He thought he had successfully dodged the bullet, but the bullet turned in the air and followed him. It even seemed to be accelerating.\n\nThe mantis-man\u2019s face paled. He began to loop and twist through the air. No matter what he did, though, Han Sen\u2019s attack followed him like a heat-seeking bullet. Its speed increased steadily as it pursued him. It was going to catch up and hit the mantis-man at any second.\n\nThe mantis-man gritted his teeth and took refuge behind a mountain. He turned to stare at the mountain behind him.\n\nPang!\n\nThe bullet punched straight through the mountain without exploding. In an instant, it was in front of the mantis-man. The mantis-man had braced himself for the bullet to blow up the mountain, but the bullet had gone through intact. He was shocked.\n\nThe mantis-man crossed his arms in front of himself. He poured more power into his defenses than he ever had before, then unleashed a scary power to counter the incoming bullet.\n\nPang!\n\nThe bullet pierced through the indestructible mantis arms, then carried on straight into the mantis-man\u2019s head. Then his head exploded.\n\nAs the mantis-man fell to the ground, the other silkworms and the audience felt their stomachs churn.\n\nThe mantis-man was one of the most powerful half-deifieds in existence. Han Sen had shot and killed him while he was trying his hardest to escape. That bullet was so strange and so powerful that it made those who saw it feel shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat geno armament does he have? Why is it so weird? How is it so strong? It went through the mountain and the mantis\u2019 arms, and still killed the mantis!\u201d Li Xue Cheng frowned.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter how strong he is. He still isn\u2019t as strong as a deified.\u201d Liyu Zhen\u2019s scowling face betrayed the desperation of his words.\n\nOpen Sky Elder laughed and said, \u201cSuch power puts him close to being deified! It might not have seemed possible for him to beat Shale before, but Shale has been reduced to King class. With Han Sen exhibiting a power like this, there is a good chance he can win.\u201d\n\nEveryone was shocked by Han Sen\u2019s frightening bullet. The other three half-deifieds ran faster than ever. They were afraid of Han Sen shooting them, too.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know was that Han Sen lacked the power to fire a second attack like that. He only wanted to try out the power of Heart Connection. Han Sen had exhausted all his strength in doing so, though. He lacked what was needed to repeat that performance.\n\n\u201cMutant Xenogeneic King hunted: Break Space Mantis. Mutant xenogeneic gene found. Obtained mutant Break Space Mantis beast soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a beginner with the skill, but Heart Connection is that powerful already? It is a shame that this geno art costs too much power. I will need to rest for a while after using it. It will be some time before I can use it again.\u201d Although Han Sen heard the beast soul announcement, he didn\u2019t dare to pay it much heed. He knew he was being watched by Exquisite and Li Keer.\n\nBreak Space Mantis\u2019 body was taken away by a Very High woman, so Han Sen had no chance to collect the xenogeneic gene from him.\n\n\u201cConsidering the power I\u2019ve just demonstrated with that bullet, there should be no other silkworms coming to bother me for a while,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself. Then, all of a sudden, someone else appeared.\n\n\u201cShale?\u201d Li Keer and Exquisite, upon seeing that body, jolted in their seats.\n\nThey knew Han Sen was exhausted. He needed time to recover. He couldn\u2019t continue fighting, but Shale was right there in front of him.\n\nUpon seeing Shale, Han Sen laughed and said, \u201cAre you that desperate to fight me?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long must you rest to get your power back?\u201d Shale asked Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTen hours,\u201d Han Sen answered.\n\n\u201cGood. I will let you rest safely for the next ten hours. If anyone else draws near, I will get rid of them.\u201d Shale sat down nearby. He had blonde hair and a square face. It looked so strong and heroic."
