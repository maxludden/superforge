    "text": "Xie Qing King stopped just short of the entrance and spoke aloud to Han Sen. \u201cDo you really have a way? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll pull you out of there!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have a way,\u201d Han Sen said calmly.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, give him your sacrifice and make the wish! Do you want to die?\u201d Captain Wood said, with a frown.\n\n\u201cHe is your god, Rebate. He is not the god of the crystallizers. Who said I absolutely must make a wish with him?\u201d Han Sen mocked the scenario.\n\n\u201cIt looks like you really don\u2019t want to live.\u201d Captain Wood looked rather gloomy.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to him if Han Sen wanted to live or die, but he was on Planet Eclipse. If Han Sen randomly died there, under his supervision, he couldn\u2019t rightly explain to Queen what had transpired.\n\n\u201cSkygod, I am not making a wish. And I will not hand over the feather. Even if you kill me or torture me, you won\u2019t obtain it. So, come on! Give me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d Han Sen said, then continued walking toward the door.\n\nSun Skygod did not say a word. Han Sen\u2019s body was growing old very quickly, though. His face had wrinkled, and his hair had gone white.\n\n\u201cEven if you do not want to use the Raven feather to save your people, aren\u2019t you interested in something for yourself? How about immortality? If you make a wish, you can live forever! Or you can become the king of some land, if you so choose. I can grant you anything you want, right here, right now.\u201d Sun Skygod finally broke his silence.\n\nHan Sen did not respond. He continued walking away. He couldn\u2019t leave, so he just kept on going.\n\n\u201cHas someone you love died? If you make a wish, I can bring them back for you.\u201d Sun Skygod offered more, seeing Han Sen\u2019s continued disinterest.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything to him, though. He just kept on going, as if he hadn\u2019t heard a thing.\n\n\u201cIf you want to become Narrow Moon\u2019s absolute master, you only have to ask that of me.\u201d Sun Skygod\u2019s offerings were becoming grander as time went on. If this continued, it wouldn\u2019t be long before Han Sen found himself in the seat of the creator.\n\nHan Sen remained unfazed and uncaring. He kept on walking. He walked in the direction of the door that could never be reached.\n\nNot long after, Han Sen\u2019s hair had all turned white. His face was covered in wrinkles. He was like a dying old man. He was really old at this point.\n\nLittle Silver, who had been sitting on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder the whole time, was old, too. His silver hair had turned white, and it looked as if he was going to die of old age.\n\n\u201cWhat? Are you not going to help him?\u201d a Marquise mocked.\n\nXie Qing King said coldly, \u201cHe said he has a way out of there.\u201d\n\nThe Marquise lifted his top lip, thinking Xie Qing King was merely too scared to go to Han Sen\u2019s aid. The others thought the same, as well. They could see him standing on the precipice, only watching Han Sen and refusing to step inside.\n\nSuddenly, the purple-bronze door shut. And then, you could not see what was beyond there. This also meant Han Sen was now hidden from sight.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Skygod is angry. Han Sen is most likely dead now. We should go, Master.\u201d Captain Wood was speaking to Black Steel.\n\nBlack Steel frowned and looked at the solemn door that had closed. He said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you two doing there? Why are you not leaving?\u201d a Marquise asked Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for Han Sen,\u201d Xie Qing King coldly said.\n\n\u201cEarlier, you two were afraid to step inside. Stop pretending about this nonsense.\u201d The Marquise lifted his lip.\n\n\u201cLet them stay,\u201d Black Steel said. Then, he signaled for the rest of the team to depart. Then, he murmured to Xie Qing King, \u201cTell Han Sen that I\u2019m sorry. I will leave much of the lotus in the base.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Xie Qing King affirmed he would.\n\nWhen Captain Wood took the others to the place\u2019s exit, Xie Qing King spoke again. He said, \u201cIs Han Sen really going to be fine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were confident he would be.\u201d Gu Qingcheng looked at the door before them and spoke carelessly.\n\n\u201cI am, but that Skygod is a dodgy fellow. I am afraid Han Sen will walk out as an old man.\u201d Xie Qing King slumped his shoulders.\n\nGu Qingcheng understood what he was getting at, but she did not respond to him.\n\nA lot of time passed, and after an hour, the purple-bronze door opened. Han Sen came out alongside Little Silver.\n\nHan Sen had not become an old man, and he was as young as he had been when he first entered the hall. He had not been injured, either.\n\nLittle Silver was fine, too. And he had his old silver fur that was radiant and shiny.\n\n\u201cDid you make a wish?\u201d Gu Qingcheng spoke to Han Sen, looking real dim.\n\nHan Sen shook his head and pulled out a box. He smiled and said, \u201cThe item Skygod wanted is still in here. Even if I make a wish, he won\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would he let you go unharmed, if you didn\u2019t make one?\u201d Xie Qing King asked with much curiosity.\n\n\u201cI was fine the whole time. Him speeding up time was merely an illusion.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cIt was an illusion? That means he wasn\u2019t real, and all his power was merely for show?\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have all the powers he pretended to have, but at least his space powers were legit. Even though he is not really all-powerful, he is still at a deified level. Even if we have to fight him eventually, we cannot deal with him now.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhy did he not kill you and just take the feather?\u201d Xie Qing King could not believe that things had worked out this way.\n\nHan Sen did not answer Xie Qing King, though. He just looked at Gu Qingcheng and asked, \u201cThat Sun Skygod, was he the same god as the one you met?\u201d\n\nGu Qingcheng shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. This one gave me a completely different feeling to the one I previously met. That being said, there appears to be a thread connecting them somehow. Maybe. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they are both of the same kind? They must both have a limitation of some sort. They cannot just kill people.\u201d Han Sen did not continue with that train of questions, though. He just looked around and asked, \u201cCaptain Wood and the others have left?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as the door shut, they took their leave. Black Steel told us he would leave some of the lotus roots for us at the base,\u201d Xie Qing King answered.\n\n\u201cI am afraid they might not even be able to leave the palace. As far as I know, those who make wishes don\u2019t meet a fond fate. Let\u2019s go. I hope we can catch up with them.\u201d Han Sen took off power walking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand! How did you know all that was an illusion?\u201d Gu Qingcheng asked, matching Han Sen\u2019s speed. She had no idea it was all a trick.\n\nHan Sen did not answer. He patted his shoulder and Little Invisible revealed itself. Han Sen smiled. \u201cIf that power was real, he should have aged, too.\u201d"
