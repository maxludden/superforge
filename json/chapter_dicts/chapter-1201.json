The blooms of destruction spread like wildfire as star-class ship after star-class ship exploded.\n\nThe weaker ships, such as the planet-class and satellite-class ships, were immediately disintegrated into nothing more than an eye-searing haze. The entire armada was crippled and destroyed, blown up like a glittery fireworks display.\n\nLike a supernova, the brightness saturated the sight of everything outside the windows. If the glass hadn\u2019t been designed to filter ultra-bright lights, they\u2019d have all been blinded for sure.\n\nAnd while the glass might have filtered the light, it could not filter the shockwaves that soon followed. They rattled the ship, rocking it backwards and forwards, terrifying them all.\n\nFortunately, they were at a distance where the shockwaves did not deal any lasting damage.\n\nOne person fell over and hurt himself, but that was the extent of it. When the rocking had calmed down, and they all looked back outside, the armada was gone. Only wreckage and a vast amount of space debris were left behind. It was a graveyard now, and nothing more.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The captain\u2019s head was bleeding as he struggled to stand up, looking out the window.\n\nNo answer came, as everyone was too fixated on the sight of that destruction. Their minds had been numbed.\n\n\u201cAre we saved? Did the Alliance send in the cavalry?\u201d a woman asked.\n\n\u201cWe are safe now, yes. But there is no cavalry,\u201d Old Xu said.\n\nTheir radar had been broken, and they couldn\u2019t see any other ships, so they wondered what had occurred. All they could see out the window was a distant planet.\n\nIf it was the Alliance that had destroyed the ships, there should have been a large-scale fight.\n\n\u201cOh my days! What happened?!\u201d\n\n\u201cGod himself gave us a hand, didn\u2019t he!\u201d\n\n\u201cGod punished his red-headed stepchildren, mwahaha! That\u2019ll teach them to misbehave and threaten us, the favored creation.\u201d\n\nThe passengers were overjoyed. They might not have understood what had happened, but the mere fact they were safe again, gave them much relief and happiness.\n\nEven the captain couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Still, his eyes couldn\u2019t keep away from the window, as if they were searching for something.\n\nSadly, though, all he could see was trash.\n\nTurning around to get the ship back in order and command the people on board, he then saw Han Sen standing in the corner with the box.\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen, box in hand, went to the command deck. All the soldiers saluted him. Han Sen did the same in return. He wasn\u2019t a soldier anymore, so it was a sign of massive respect for them to salute him in unison.\n\nInside the command deck, the captain and Old Xu approached Han Sen. The rest of the personnel stood up in respect, too.\n\nThe captain gave Han Sen a salute, prompting the rest to do so, as well.\n\nEven the young couple looked serious. Han Sen did not say a word. He merely returned the salute again.\n\n\u201cYou saved us all,\u201d the captain excitedly said.\n\n\u201cI was just saving myself,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\n\u201cLet us discuss this further in my office.\u201d The captain brought Han Sen to his office, while Old Xu followed from behind.\n\n\u201cDid you destroy the shura fleet?\u201d The captain didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush, and he asked Han Sen directly.\n\nHe could not see another reason why all the shura ships were destroyed, so the logical conclusion was for it to have been Han Sen\u2019s doing.\n\nOf course, Han Sen was one person and he was alone. Even if he was to believe it was his doing, it\u2019d be a mighty struggle. But with no other alternative explanations, who else\u2019s doing could it have been?\n\nHan Sen answered, \u201cYou think too highly of me. Even if I was a demi-god, I could not destroy a whole shura fleet by myself.\u201d\n\nThe captain thought he was right. Han Sen was just a human surpasser, after all. But still, it was too strange of an occurrence for him to write it off completely.\n\nHan Sen was annoyed, though. He drove the black beetle to the enemy and spent five purple crystals in nuking the fleet. The power was enough to wipe the entire army out of existence, and then some.\n\nAlthough Han Sen had many purple crystals, he couldn\u2019t get more whenever he wished. He had to be careful in their use.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, can you give that back to me?\u201d Old Xu asked as he pointed at the box.\n\nHan Sen placed the alloy box down on the table, but he wasn\u2019t giving it back. He said, \u201cYou can have it back, but I almost died to save it. If you tell me what\u2019s inside, I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u201d\n\nThe captain said, \u201cOld Xu, maybe it would be best if you told him.\u201d\n\nOld Xu said, \u201cOkay, since you saved my life.\u201d\n\nOld Xu accepted the alloy box and opened it. He then examined the bottle of some tincture. Han Sen only wanted to know what it might have been. He didn\u2019t actually want or need it.\n\nOld Xu said, \u201cHave you heard of Angel Gene fluid? I am in charge of it. And my team and I created it\u2026 Well\u2026 Not quite. I suppose it is more accurate to say I copied it.\u201d"
