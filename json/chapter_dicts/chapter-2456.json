    "text": "\u201cThe Shocking World Record of the Extreme King. In the beginning of the Extreme King, the sky and ground welcomed this race\u2026\u201d the woman said, reading the prologue in a smooth voice. She broke off, and a scornful chuckle rolled out of her throat. \u201cVery presumptuous. He was just a slave of Sacred Leader, so how dare he say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems as if this woman is connected to the Sacred Leader somehow. It also looks like the Extreme King\u2019s alpha once belonged to Sacred, maybe as a low-level servant?\u201d Han Sen thought in surprise.\n\nThe woman continued to read the Shocking World Record, and after a while, she started to look annoyed. \u201cI thought this would be something special, but it\u2019s just a half-*ssed version of Sacred Leader\u2019s blood spirit body. And this guy has the nerve to call it a king body? Very funny.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes widened even further. \u201cNo way. The Extreme King\u2019s king bodies were invented by the Sacred Leader?\u201d\n\nThe woman looked at the book in her hands with distaste, but she continued to read it all the way through. As her eyes moved along the pages, Han Sen read the entirety of the Shocking World Record with her.\n\nAlthough this manuscript wasn\u2019t the original copy, it still had the exact same contents as the original Shocking World Record. It was a very powerful and multi-faceted geno art. It had everything a person could want in it. If a member of the Extreme King had a king body of their own, they could find a skill to learn within the Shocking World Record.\n\n\u201cThis slave stole my Geno World Speech. He was kind of smart, honestly. He combined the Geno World Speech with a blood spirit body. But the Geno World Speech and the blood spirit body were each only half-finished. No matter how they are combined, they won\u2019t reach the final stage.\u201d The woman had lost her interest in the Shocking World Record of the Extreme King. She placed it back on the shelf.\n\nHan Sen was frozen, and he thought, \u201cThis woman doesn\u2019t look too old, but she speaks as if she was alive in Sacred Leader\u2019s day. Is such a thing possible? How has she survived for such a long time?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t blame the slave,\u201d the woman said with a sigh. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t bring himself up to the Super Gene level. Even the Sacred Leader and I failed continually, and he was just a slave with a slightly abnormal amount of intelligence. His achievements were respectable, all things considered.\u201d She proceeded to sit down on a chair.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart shook. \u201cWhat the hell? Is the \u2018Super Gene\u2019 she mentioned related to the sanctuaries somehow?\u201d\n\nThe woman glanced through her notebook in boredom. She closed it and put it back. Then she sighed again. \u201cThere are no clues to follow. I can\u2019t figure out why The Story of Genes can\u2019t be practiced, but lowering the practice requirements will make it impossible to generate a Super Gene. What am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s throat had tightened into a knot, and he wanted to scream. \u201cThe Story of Genes! She\u2019s researching The Story of Genes? Who is this woman\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the Sacred leader was correct. It\u2019s simply impossible to determine the faults in some geno arts. We need to find a way for creatures\u2019 genes to evolve more quickly. If we can hasten the speed at which genes evolve\u2026 But in that case, why would we need The Story of Genes? That way won\u2019t work.\u201d The woman shook her head tiredly.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart was like a sea tossed by a violent storm. It was full of scary waves and rattling winds.\n\nIf what the woman said was true, she might have been the person who actually created The Story of Genes. She might have had a direct connection to the Sacred Leader, and maybe she even knew him personally.\n\nHan Sen wanted to run far away from this terrifying woman, but\u2026 He wanted to find out her secrets even more.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t tell what level the woman might have been. If Han Sen could, he would have liked to tie the woman up and interrogate her until he had extracted every last bit of info she had to give.\n\nBut considering that the woman might have hailed from the same era as the Sacred Leader, he shoved that thought away before it led him into doing something rash. There were too many unknowns here, but the bits and pieces he was putting together told him that if he challenged this woman, he could be in grave danger.\n\nIf she had conducted research alongside Sacred Leader and considered the Extreme King as little more than servants, her power had to be substantial.\n\nPerhaps she wasn\u2019t as strong as Purple Fight, but there was a high chance of her being a top-class deified. Han Sen wasn\u2019t confident that he could take on someone like that. If he revealed himself, he might be the one getting interrogated.\n\nHan Sen had to be patient. If the woman continued to talk to herself, she might reveal more secrets out loud.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t talk to herself every day. Sometimes, she wouldn\u2019t say a single word, but whenever the demon spirit paid a visit, she seemed to blow a fuse. After screaming and cursing at the demon spirit until he left, she would talk to herself for the rest of the day while she cooled off.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t voice any more secrets. The woman spent most of her time researching The Story of Genes. She used any geno art she was able to get her hands on to test and modify it.\n\nShe tried many different methods, but none of them seemed to stick.\n\nAs the woman worked in her notebook, Han Sen could see the complete The Story of Genes. After a brief examination, he confirmed that it was truly the same geno art that he possessed.\n\nThere were some differences, though. Because this woman\u2019s The Story of Genes had some modifications, some parts of the geno art were more advanced than Han Sen\u2019s version.\n\nBut there weren\u2019t many differences. Clearly, The Story of Genes had been completed a long time ago. But since practicing The Story of Genes in its original form was simply unfeasible, modifications had been required.\n\nIn addition to the original version, the woman had experimented with hundreds of altered variants of the geno art. The woman had made each version unique in some way, hoping to find a new form of the geno art that was superior to the original. None of the attempts succeeded, though. All the variants were, at the end of the day, failed experiments.\n\nHan Sen himself had practiced The Story of Genes. When he first started attempting to use the geno art, his fitness level had been far too low to actually practice the skill. But with the help of the black crystal armor, he was eventually able to perform The Story of Genes.\n\nHan Sen had spoken to Professor Bai Yishan about the geno art. No ordinary being could practice with The Story of Genes because the fitness requirements were too dizzying to comprehend. The only way it could be learned, supposedly, was to have a body as perfect as a god\u2019s. Normal people had flaws in their bodies, and even minuscule flaws would make the geno art unlearnable.\n\nHan Sen watched the woman conduct research every day. Although she wasn\u2019t making any progress, Han Sen started to gain a much deeper understanding of The Story of Genes.\n\nThere were many things he had never fully understood in the past, but now, they had become clear.\n\nWhile Han Sen was enjoying his newfound knowledge, the woman walked out of the wooden house. She went to a pool in the garden. She crouched down, and it appeared as if she was going to take a sip of the water. But when she saw her reflection, she froze.\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Han Sen got a shock suddenly."
