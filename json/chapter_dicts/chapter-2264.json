    "text": "When the blood kirin saw that Han Sen wasn\u2019t eating anything, it turned around to continue consuming the corpse by itself. It looked as if it wasn\u2019t going to stop until every last morsel of the black kirin had been consumed.\n\nHan Sen had no interest in watching the beast eat, so he decided to leave the cave. He leaped into the blood water and swam back the way he had come. The cave had no other exits, so he had to leave via the same blood pond.\n\nAfter he crawled out of the pond, Han Sen picked a few blood pears to give to Little Silver. The fox had retrieved the Thunder God Spike for him, but in doing so, it had been injured.\n\nBoth the fox and the weapon were of the lightning element, but the Thunder God Spike was clearly far more powerful than Little Silver. If Little Silver\u2019s Lightning Fox Body hadn\u2019t possessed full immunity to lightning, then the little creature might not have been able to pull the Thunder God Spike out.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve helped the blood kirin, it won\u2019t mind if I take more blood pears and give them to Little Silver, right? I\u2019m sure the blood kirin wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself as he collected the fruit. He lobbed them into Destiny\u2019s Tower for Little Silver. But when he glanced inside the tower, he found Little Silver curled up to rest. Its tail was wrapped around the Thunder God Spike, and the Thunder God Spike was crackling as silver lightning arced around it. The bolts would occasionally jump to touch Little Silver\u2019s fur, but the fox didn\u2019t seem to mind. It just continued to rest.\n\nHan Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look. When the Thunder God Spike\u2019s lightning landed on Little Silver, the small fox was absorbing its power. The lightning blended into Little Silver\u2019s powers, slowly changing them as the fox rested.\n\nHan Sen walked over and gently set one of the blood pears beside Little Silver. Then, he exited the tower and left the lotus mountain.\n\nWhen he made it down from the lotus mountain, he found Fox Queen standing directly in front of the hellish skeletal gate. She was looking at him.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s eyebrows rose as Han Sen approached.\n\nHer chains wouldn\u2019t let her move far from the gate. Otherwise, she would have explored the distant mountain range for herself long ago.\n\n\u201cYou killed the blood kirin?\u201d Fox Queen asked in a disturbed tone of voice.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t defeat a foe like that. But I\u2019ve been here for a while, and we\u2019ve gotten to know each other a bit. It hasn\u2019t been hostile to me at all.\u201d\n\nFox Queen looked at Han Sen with a veiled expression. She thought Han Sen\u2019s explanation had to be utter nonsense.\n\nThe blood kirin was a beast of particular savagery, and it had been locked up in White Bone Hell all its life. If it ever escaped the White Bone Hell, few would survive an encounter with it. That thing was a King class demon.\n\nIf the blood kirin had grown comfortable with Han Sen simply because he had spent time with it, she wondered why the same had not occurred between the monster and herself. She had spent far more time with it, and she had even watched it grow up. Yet, there wasn\u2019t even a faint semblance of closeness between her and the beast.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Fox Queen stared at Han Sen. She had found his behavior suspicious for a long time, and it made her wary of him. Perhaps Han Sen really had been taken by General Ghost Bone, and he had just been pretending ever since.\n\n\u201cI told you; I am a member of the Ice Blue Knights.\u201d Han Sen said, a little reproachfully.\n\nFox Queen started to respond, but all of a sudden, her face changed. \u201cSomeone forced open the palace\u2019s door.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Han Sen was shocked. That palace had been built by General Ghost Bone. Not even a deified elite should have been able to open it. And there was no way Edward or the others could have gotten through the entrance.\n\n\u201cThey have only breached the first line. They are coming in via the primary entrance. Huh. It seems that they have a death wish.\u201d Fox Queen narrowed her eyes and walked back through the hellish skeletal gate.\n\nHan Sen felt sick. He didn\u2019t think Edward and the others would make it inside, but now they had. Han Sen\u2019s identity would soon be exposed.\n\nRealizing this, Han Sen quickly followed Fox Queen. But he then rushed out of the side hall ahead of her.\n\nJust as Fox Queen had said, there was an opening in the gate of the main hall. Edward and the others were now coming in.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, where are you going to run this time?\u201d shouted a King class Ice Blue Knight. Then, he ran at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cShut up! This isn\u2019t a place that you can just smash your way into!\u201d Han Sen shouted as he quickly retreated. He fell back to Fox Queen, who had just appeared. Ice Blue Knight King\u2019s power was headed for Fox Queen.\n\nFox Queen\u2019s face drew into a smile, but her eyes glimmered with the fire of murder. She didn\u2019t even have to move her hand as a cord of power shot out of her and wrapped around the Ice Blue Knight.\n\n\u201cCareful!\u201d Ice Blue Knight King shouted. He moved to help the King class Ice Blue Knight, but it was too late.\n\nThe cord of power tightened, and the Ice Blue Knight\u2019s body was torn apart. It was horrifying to watch. The warrior was murdered before he even had a chance to defend himself.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s scalp felt numb. A King class elite had been oh-so-easily killed. The demonstration of Fox Queen\u2019s power confirmed Han Sen\u2019s belief that she was deified. It was fortunate she had wanted to keep Han Sen with her instead of killing him. Han Sen would have been very dead if things had turned out differently.\n\nThe faces of the other intruders turned white. They turned to leave the palace, but the opening they created to enter had already disappeared. And that was because of Fox Queen.\n\nEdward and the others attacked the palace\u2019s gate, but their efforts were futile.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? You can\u2019t just come and go from this palace as you please.\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s cords of power began to move again, heading for Edward and all the others.\n\nEdward, Ice Blue Knight King, and Crime managed to block the attacks, but the other King class elites were all captured.\n\n\u201cDeified powers are scary!\u201d Han Sen\u2019s scalp felt numb. It seemed like Fox Queen was no longer being hampered by the palace. She was able to use her full deified powers without limit or restriction.\n\nHan Sen looked closer and realized what was going on. Edward and the others had managed to break the restrictions of the palace. Their actions had triggered the prison\u2019s defense systems, allowing Fox Queen to use her full powers to annihilate the invaders. Now that Fox Queen had all her deified power back, she was a totally different being than she had been when Han Sen met her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! We accidentally wandered into this place. We meant you no harm. Please forgive us\u2026\u201d Before Edward could finish his apology, a cord of power wrapped around him.\n\nNot long after, the last of the intruders were bound by Fox Queen\u2019s cords. None of them could fight back.\n\nWhen Fox Queen turned back to Han Sen, he quickly said, \u201cBig Sis, you are so good! You are so intelligent, beautiful, and powerful!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I heard them refer to you by the name of Han Sen.\u201d Fox Queen stared at Han Sen and gave him a predatory smile."
