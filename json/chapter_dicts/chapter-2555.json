Nearby Kings felt their hearts pounding in their chests. They felt as if their hearts were going to explode.\n\nAs everyone drowned in this shock, they knew they had to leave the area and watch Han Sen from a greater distance.\n\nAutumn Wind started to look grim. Sweat trickled down his forehead. Han Sen was going to pull the bowstring back as far as possible. If he fired it now, Autumn Wind was genuinely unsure whether or not he could dodge the arrow.\n\nWind String, at full strength, could harm a deified. Autumn Wind was only half-deified. Even though it was his bow, he didn\u2019t think he could avoid an arrow fired by it.\n\nKat!\n\nWhen Wind String\u2019s bowstring reached the halfway point, Han Sen felt as if something had gotten stuck. He couldn\u2019t pull the string further or let it go. As this occurred, a tornado-like substance chain was released by the bow. It became a scary space tornado that pulled Han Sen into it.\n\n\u201cOh, no! Oh, no! Wind String is going to consume him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad luck for Han Sen. Why did he have to borrow that cursed Wind String?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Wind String cut off Han Sen\u2019s head?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to say. Many people have been decapitated by Wind String.\u201d\n\nSweat ran down Autumn Wind\u2019s forehead. If Han Sen fired that arrow, he didn\u2019t think he could dodge it.\n\nAs all the Kings discussed this, the tornado surrounding Wind String suddenly disappeared. And Han Sen was still at the center of the storm. He was holding the bow, with its bowstring moving again as he drew it further back. He hadn\u2019t been hurt by Wind String.\n\nWind String kept groaning in his hands. It looked as if it didn\u2019t want to be there, but it had no choice but to submit to its new wielder. And as a result, it groaned.\n\n\u201cWhen I, Han Sen, want to fire an arrow, you have to open up no matter what,\u201d Han Sen proclaimed. Then he applied a massive amount of strength from his fingers. The bowstring that wasn\u2019t fully drawn was suddenly pulled all the way. It was now as far as it could go. It looked like a full moon.\n\nWind String shivered and shook, releasing an angry roar. But its protests did nothing. It couldn\u2019t stop Han Sen from firing an arrow.\n\nEveryone was shocked. Han Sen was using Wind String by force. Even its powers of consumption didn\u2019t prevent its new wielder from using it. Seeing Wind String now was like watching a woman with a man forcing himself on top of her.\n\nHan Sen trained an arrow on Autumn Wind. Autumn Wind\u2019s face went grey. The sweat pouring from him had started to soak his clothes.\n\nSeeing that Han Sen on the cusp of firing an arrow, Autumn Wind finally shouted, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t shoot! I know that you can.\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored his plight. It had been so hard to pull the string of that bow; after all that work, he was definitely going to fire it.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nWhen Han Sen released the bowstring, it broke the fabric of space. The arrow flew out, disappearing from everyone\u2019s vision.\n\nAutumn Wind became a typhoon. He kept shifting position like a wind that no one could catch.\n\nBut somehow, that feather arrow still appeared in front of him. It was going to shoot right through his forehead. Autumn Wind was a dead man.\n\nJust as the feather arrow was about to puncture Autumn Wind\u2019s forehead, the arrow suddenly abandoned its target. It shot away from everyone, heading toward a nearby planet instead.\n\nPang!\n\nThe arrow perforated the entire planet, and a second later, the planet exploded. The shockwave washed over several other planets, and the Kings around them were knocked off-balance by the shockwaves.\n\nFortunately, they were far away from the planet. Otherwise, the explosion would have hurt them a lot.\n\nAutumn Wind\u2019s face looked pale. If that arrow had hit him, his body would have been annihilated. He would have been unable to escape.\n\nEven when he used Wind String, he couldn\u2019t summon that much power from the bow. After all, he wasn\u2019t deified. He couldn\u2019t use the full potential of Wind String.\n\n\u201cThank you for not killing me, Mr. Han.\u201d Autumn Wind bowed to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDo I need to demonstrate with another arrow?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Autumn Wind.\n\n\u201cThere is no need. I lost. I will keep my promise and pull the rickshaw on your behalf. It will be an honor to do this,\u201d Autumn Wind said.\n\nHan Sen returned Wind String and its quiver to Autumn Wind. The bow\u2019s master was Autumn Wind. Han Sen could use it, but he needed the soul robe, Jadeskin, and the power of the Dongxuan Sutra to do so. Firing that one arrow had tired him out more than an entire fight could. No matter how good the bow was, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for Han Sen to use.\n\nPlus, Han Sen had only said that he wanted to borrow it. He always planned to return it.\n\nAutumn Wind accepted the bow and returned it to his back. He walked in front of the bronze rickshaw and stood next to Ji Yang Sheng. He pulled the rope and said, \u201cMr. Ji, now that we are coworkers, it is nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cF*ck that. Look after your own *ss,\u201d Ji Yang Sheng hissed furiously. He was thinking about why elites like themselves had to operate a rickshaw. And he wondered why Autumn Wind showed so much enthusiasm for the lowly task.\n\nWhen people saw Ji Yang Sheng and Autumn Wind pulling the bronze rickshaw, they finally shook off their daze.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Daddy really deserves his title. He is too much of a f*cking god. How could he force Wind String to submit to him without ending up dead? Is he really a King? Are you sure he isn\u2019t a deified in disguise?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense! Deifieds can\u2019t enter the core area.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right. But when he used the bow, I think he generated a substance chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat feather robe must be a powerful deified treasure. That has to be how he was granted such a scary amount of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder the Extreme King can\u2019t capture him. He is way too strong.\u201d\n\nThere were some Extreme King princes and princesses there, but none of them opted to attack Han Sen. No one was willing to try to stop him. His performance with Wind String was so scary that it had stunned everyone.\n\nIn the core area, not even the Extreme King wanted to confront him. Unless they could bring deifieds to bear against him, Han Sen\u2019s power was simply overwhelming.\n\nAll the races researched the video of Han Sen firing his arrow. The widely-accepted explanation was that the feather robe was a mysterious treasure that helped him. It could some allow Han Sen\u2019s power to rival a deified.\n\n\u201cThat *sshole! How does he have so much good luck? First, he earned the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze, and now he has that mysterious feather robe. How many treasures does he have?\u201d The Sixth Uncle of the Extreme King saw the footage and moaned.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we cannot capture him in the core area. We must find him in the systems of chaos,\u201d the Fourth Uncle Meng Lie said in a hard voice.\n\n\u201cSpring Rain has been looking for him. I hope they will return bearing results.\u201d The Sixth Uncle didn\u2019t harbor much hope for Spring Rain\u2019s success, though.\n\nAll the races now understood one thing: Han Sen shouldn\u2019t be provoked in the core area."
