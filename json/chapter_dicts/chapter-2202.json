    "text": "\u201cMy daughter cannot control the strength she uses on the Drum. Will that be okay?\u201d Han Sen double-checked with them.\n\nThe worker laughed, pointed to the base around them, and said, \u201cThe base has the appropriate equipment to absorb and sustain the sonic power. Even if a King whacked a Jade Drum, the excessive force would be dampened by the technology. Only a small bit of the shockwave will ultimately spread. Do not worry. And if there are any issues here at the registration booth, we will claim full responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Han Sen nodded. He had been afraid something terrible might happen, and he would end up being responsible for it.\n\nHe had heard the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s noise before, and he knew it was quite different from the average Jade Drum. An ordinary Jade Drum expelled its sonic powers in a wide radius without much of a focus.\n\nThe Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s behavior was unique. The force lashed out in the manner of a scorpion\u2019s stinging tail. When the Drum was struck, the sound was sharp and focused. It pierced right through a person. It was very difficult to describe.\n\nBao\u2019er had struck it lackadaisically earlier, and that small blow was enough to bring Han Sen and Huangfu Jing to the brink of death. If Bao\u2019er hit it any harder, there was every chance someone in that establishment could die.\n\n\u201cFriends, my daughter doesn\u2019t know how to measure the strength she exerts. How about you all take a step back, in case something happens. It\u2019s so you can avoid injury.\u201d Han Sen looked at the elites in the lobby. People of all different races were assembled there. If the Drum killed them all, it would mean Han Sen had caused a grievous offense to each of the races.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Drum. Just hit it! Why must you keep talking?\u201d All the people present were very skilled at sonic powers already, so they were all very eager to see the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s power. They weren\u2019t willing to just leave on a whim.\n\n\u201cUm, if you guys don\u2019t want to leave, then you may want to take some measure to protect yourselves. Don\u2019t take it out on us if you end up getting hurt after a fair warning,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWho will take it out on you for this? We might take something else out on you for talking constant crap and not getting a move on. Hit it now or put the Jade Drum down and get lost!\u201d Many of the elites were growing annoyed with the delays.\n\n\u201cWell, I warned you. All I can say is, look after yourselves.\u201d Han Sen set Bao\u2019er down by the Drum and then retreated. He summoned his Bai Sema around himself, Huangfu Jing, the worker, and the registry booth. Then, he blinked to Bao\u2019er who was still outside of the Bai Sema. \u201cBao\u2019er, hit it. But don\u2019t hit it too hard.\u201d\n\nHan Sen shielded the worker because he was genuinely afraid that the man wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the hit. The Drum couldn\u2019t be registered if the person who was supposed to register it died.\n\nEveryone saw Han Sen taking this so seriously, and they started to appear a little confused.\n\nThe worker said that there was equipment in place to ventilate excess sonic powers. They were designed to deal exclusively with the power of the Drums. Even if a King class elite struck a Drum, nothing much would happen. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum was a mutant Jade Drum, yes, but if a mere child was going to strike it, that shouldn\u2019t have posed much of an issue.\n\nThat was what the onlookers were thinking, anyway, as they saw Bao\u2019er standing over the Jade Drum. Then, she hit it.\n\nPang!\n\nThe small hand came down on the drum, and a very low boom sounded. Before anyone could react, they all felt as if steel rods had been driven down into their heads.\n\nBzzt!\n\nEveryone\u2019s head buzzed, and their bodies felt like they were being impaled. No one present could keep their bodies composed, and they collapsed to writhe and convulse on the ground. It was like they were having a stroke.\n\nThey began to froth at the mouth, and many of their bladders let loose. The entire lobby began to stink, as a whole bunch of Nobles began rolling around on the ground and soiling themselves.\n\nSonic Butterfly King and Stephen believed themselves to be sonic elites. And there was sonic absorption equipment installed there. They hadn\u2019t taken any measures to protect themselves.\n\nThey had no idea that the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum would pose that big of a threat when compared to the average Jade Drum. When the strange Drum sounded, they didn\u2019t even see the sonic ripples assault them. The sonic needles didn\u2019t give them time to block. Their brains no longer functioned correctly, and they collapsed to wriggle and roll across the floor.\n\nAlthough they weren\u2019t in as bad shape as the Dukes and Marquises, they still felt as if their heads were about to explode. They couldn\u2019t think straight, and they couldn\u2019t even lift themselves up off the floor.\n\nHan Sen thought he\u2019d end up killing someone, but it looked as if no one had actually died. Their heads had been hit fiercely, though, so he did not think anyone would be recovering for quite some time.\n\nIt looked like the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s power didn\u2019t actually kill those it affected. It just messed with their brains and left them incredibly dazed.\n\nHan Sen kept thinking that such a weapon was perfect for him.\n\nAnd while all those people were still disoriented, Han Sen could take Huangfu Jing and Bao\u2019er to leave safely.\n\n\u201cYou guys said the Thousand Treasures would bear the responsibility for anything bad that might happen. Can we register this item now?\u201d Han Sen shook the worker to rouse him and get his attention. The man was still frozen in disbelief.\n\nThe worker looked very surprised by the events that had just transpired. He watched the Nobles rolling around on the floor. While they might have looked very elegant only moments before, they now looked filthy with all the bodily deposits they were rolling in. Their prior cockiness had quickly evaporated.\n\nEven Sonic Butterfly King and Stephen. They were mumbling something about being dizzy and needing to sit on the floor, but they couldn\u2019t help but touch the waste unleashed by the other Nobles.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up and get this thing registered.\u201d Han Sen stared down at the worker.\n\nThe worker snapped out of his daze as if he had just woken from a dream. Then, he went to register the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.\n\nAfter that, Han Sen took his companions and departed. The Blood Scorpion Jade Drum was strong, but that was because Sonic Butterfly King and the others hadn\u2019t bothered to prepare any defenses. Now that they knew what to expect, it would be harder to use the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum on them again.\n\nClients weren\u2019t permitted to kill anyone on Planet Jade Drum. Being wanted by the Thousand Treasures would be bad. Han Sen needed to put as much distance as he could between himself and the people who had just been dazed while they were still unable to follow.\n\nHan Sen took Bao\u2019er away from Planet Jade Drum and thought to himself, \u201cThe Blood Scorpion Jade Drum\u2019s dazing powers are strong. Even the Kings were affected by it. I really need to get its approval so I can use it for myself in the universe. If I use that on an enemy, I can do whatever I want to them.\u201d\n\nTen minutes after leaving Planet Jade Drum, Sonic Butterfly King and Stephen started to regain their senses. Their heads, however, were in agony.\n\nSonic Butterfly King ignored his own discomfort. He stood up, with his hand clutching his head. He asked the worker, \u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have now left Planet Jade Drum. Where exactly they went, I do not know,\u201d the worker said.\n\nSonic Butterfly King wouldn\u2019t dare attack the people of the Thousand Treasures. While holding their heads, they left Planet Jade Drum in the hope of finding their escapees.\n\nAfter ten minutes of searching, they were unable to find Han Sen, and they had no clue in which direction he might have fled.\n\nSonic Butterfly King flew out of Planet Jade Drum, his body still shivering. He had a pounding headache that was worse than a heavy hangover.\n\nStephen followed. He was in the same state, and he didn\u2019t find any trace of Han Sen\u2019s group either.\n\nThey were lucky that their King class bodies could withstand what they had just endured. The Dukes and Marquises were sure to be out of commission for another few days. Their heads felt as if they were going to explode."
