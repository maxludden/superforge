He gave the closer one to Exquisite, as he didn\u2019t want to steal the kill from her.\n\nGravity was strong there. Even teleportation happened slowly beneath that level of pressure. When Han Sen teleported near the demon crocodile, Exquisite had already killed the creature.\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen and then teleported again. She appeared in front of Han Sen, cutting the other demon crocodile in half as well.\n\nThese crocodiles were just second or third-tier Kings, but they lived in an environment with strong gravity. Their bodies were incredibly dense and hard. It was scary to see Exquisite kill one in a mere second.\n\nBut Han Sen was no longer focused on Exquisite\u2019s skills. If they had been engaging in a simple competition before, things had now gone beyond that. This was straight-up thievery.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, do you have to be in such a rush?\u201d Han Sen said, looking at her.\n\n\u201cIf I can earn more by putting in more work, why wouldn\u2019t I do my best?\u201d Exquisite asked coolly. There was no emotion in her voice. She spoke as if this was something that she did every day.\n\n\u201cYou are right. People should do all they can.\u201d Han Sen looked at Exquisite and nodded.\n\nLi Keer hastily tried to repair the atmosphere of the group, and so she said, \u201cPlease do not mind her behavior, Dollar. Third Sister is always like this. She doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen laughed and said, \u201cLady Exquisite is right. Trying your best is the right thing to do. I need to learn from her.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere was awkward, to say the least. Li Keer didn\u2019t know what to say now. The three of them continued to travel forward. The planet was very large. They had to slog forward under the weight of its gravity. After flying for an hour, they spotted another demon crocodile.\n\nAs soon as the creature came into view, Han Sen and Exquisite were gone. Exquisite wanted to make sure that she didn\u2019t let Han Sen kill a single demon crocodile. She was going to get every one.\n\nLi Keer felt glum. She didn\u2019t want to test Han Sen this way, but if this was how Exquisite wanted to do things, she had no choice but to accept it. After all, she was low-ranking in the Very High. She had no authority over Third Sister Exquisite.\n\n\u201cIf this keeps going, Dollar will get angry,\u201d Li Keer thought to herself. She didn\u2019t know what she could do to make their relationship better.\n\nWhile she was thinking, Li Keer saw the demon crocodile\u2019s skull crumble. In a split second, its metallic head was reduced to sand.\n\nLi Keer was surprised. The creature hadn\u2019t died by Exquisite\u2019s space cutting skill; that was the geno art called Big Destroyed.\n\nExquisite knew many geno arts, but not even she knew Big Destroyed. The geno art couldn\u2019t be learned unless someone had the body of a Destroyed. Although there were some members of the Very High that had been fortunate enough to study Big Destroyed, the numbers of such people were few. And they had a great deal of difficulty becoming proficient with the skill. Exquisite had never bothered with it.\n\nLi Keer took a closer look. It wasn\u2019t Exquisite that had broken the crocodile\u2019s head. It was Han Sen. She was surprised, and she murmured to herself, \u201cHe really did learn Big Destroyed.\u201d\n\nWhen Li Keer had seen Han Sen receive Big Destroyed in trade, she had thought Han Sen was being an idiot. She believed it would be impossible for him to learn it. However, in such a short amount of time, Han Sen had become proficient with the skill. And on top of that, he could use it in battle now. It was scarcely believable.\n\n\u201cIs this guy that talented?\u201d Li Keer looked at Han Sen with shock.\n\nBefore, Han Sen had easily learned God\u2019s Wander. When he did, Li Keer was very surprised. Now, he was showing off Big Destroyed.\n\nThe most unbelievable thing about it all was that Han Sen had managed to kill the demon crocodile before Exquisite could. Li Keer couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nLi Keer didn\u2019t think there was any way that Dollar\u2019s teleportation ability could be superior to Exquisite\u2019s. Dollar had only just learned God\u2019s Wander, after all.\n\n\u201cHow can he be faster than Third Sister?\u201d Li Keer looked at Exquisite. Exquisite was staring at Han Sen.\n\nExquisite\u2019s face was expressionless, but she was shocked on the inside. She was thinking as hard as she could, trying to figure out how Han Sen was faster than her. It should have been impossible.\n\n\u201cLady Exquisite, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Han Sen laughed and dug out the demon crocodile\u2019s xenogeneic gene.\n\n\u201cYou got it with your power. There is no need to apologize,\u201d Exquisite responded in a level tone. Then, she resumed her flight.\n\nExquisite thought she must have underestimated Dollar. Because of that, she must not have tried her best. \u201cThis is good. It is great that I can force him to reveal his true power.\u201d\n\nBut Exquisite formulated a plan to keep Han Sen from securing any other kills after this.\n\n\u201cDollar, you really managed to learn Big Destroyed?\u201d Li Keer flew over to Han Sen and tried to chat with him.\n\n\u201cI got lucky. I\u2019ve only just learned it,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cAre all humans so talented? Why have I never heard of this race before?\u201d Li Keer and Han Sen started to chat.\n\nHan Sen and Li Keer were talking, but Han Sen kept his eyes peeled for crocodiles. Li Keer was a little distracting, and Exquisite wasn\u2019t talking. All of her focus was placed on her surroundings. She was going to make sure she killed any creatures that appeared before Dollar could get to them.\n\nSuddenly, a demon crocodile appeared in front of Exquisite. Exquisite used God\u2019s Wander to teleport over to it. But when she appeared in front of that demon crocodile, the crocodile\u2019s head had already been crushed. Han Sen was standing right next to her, chuckling.\n\nLi Keer and Exquisite were both frozen. When this happened the first time, they could convince themselves that it had been a fluke or a mistake. This time, however, they couldn\u2019t deny that Exquisite had simply lost.\n\nThis time, Exquisite had tried her best to reach the demon crocodile first, but she had lost to Dollar again. And on top of that, he\u2019d been in the middle of a conversation with Li Keer.\n\nExquisite let her eyes linger on Han Sen for some time. Then, she looked back at Li Keer and asked, \u201cIs he using God\u2019s Wander?\u201d\n\nExquisite could tell that Han Sen was using God\u2019s Wander, but there was no way Han Sen\u2019s God\u2019s Wander was better than hers. Her experience with God\u2019s Wander should have been far greater than Han Sen\u2019s. She shouldn\u2019t have lost to him.\n\n\u201cThat must be God\u2019s Wander, right?\u201d Li Keer wasn\u2019t sure anymore, either. She knew that if Dollar was using God\u2019s Wander, he couldn\u2019t be any faster than Exquisite. But somehow, he was.\n\n\u201cNext time, take a closer look and observe. See if he is truly using God\u2019s Wander,\u201d Exquisite instructed.\n\nThe three of them kept on traveling. When they saw another demon crocodile, Exquisite focused her mind beyond what she thought was possible. But even so, she was still slower than Han Sen.\n\nThis time, Li Keer and Exquisite were able to confirm that Han Sen was indeed using God\u2019s Wander. But he should have been no better than a beginner with God\u2019s Wander. He should have been far slower than Exquisite.\n\nBut this beginner level of God\u2019s Wander was faster than Exquisite\u2019s advanced techniques. Exquisite couldn\u2019t believe this truth, but as they continued to move forward, she was no longer able to collect any more spoils from the demon crocodiles. The next seven demon crocodiles were stolen by Han Sen."
