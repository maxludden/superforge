Before him lay the ruins and remnants of what was once a glorious and immaculately conceived and constructed shelter. And in the midst of the ruins was Xie Qing King, who seemed to be enjoying a nice, cold beer. Still, he was glad the place had been saved and his companions had pulled through.\n\n\u201cGood job.\u201d Han Sen gave him a high-five.\n\nHan Sen had heard what had transpired through Thorn Queen, especially what Xie Qing King had managed pull off in order to kill Gold General.\n\n\u201cI am Xie Qing King, not Xie Qing Emperor,\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\n\u201cI thought you were a super emperor now!\u201d Han Sen said, in hysterics.\n\nFortunately, no one had died during the siege. An incredible thing, too, given how hairy things became. Having the silver fox and the Holy Rhino around to heal was a brilliant thing, and they had both proven themselves to be invaluable assets to the composition of Han Sen\u2019s primary force, despite Xie Qing King\u2019s personal feelings towards Little Silver\u2019s shock therapy treatment.\n\nThe talent of healing was quite rare, overall. Individually, such creatures had a hard time surviving due to their weakness in attacking.\n\nAnd because of that, it was difficult for them to level up.\n\nNine gene lock creatures like the Holy Rhino were an extremely rare find, and it was no wonder its original owner had gone to such lengths to procure it.\n\nSaint Fan himself made sure to use the Holy Rhino a lot, too, and it had proven a great asset for him, before his death.\n\nHan Sen, Thorn Queen, and Xie Qing King were having a merry chat when Moment Queen exited the spirit hall, heading in their direction. Moment Queen didn\u2019t seem like her usual self, though. In fact, she was looking quite grim. It prompted the interest and concern of those talking.\n\n\u201cCan someone tell me who Godslayer Luo is?\u201d Moment Queen asked.\n\nMoment Queen was in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary when Godslayer Luo was in the third, so it wasn\u2019t too surprising to learn she did not know much about him.\n\n\u201cA human elite; why? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Han Sen thought her asking such a question was strange. Something was amiss.\n\nMoment Queen pointed at Zero and said, \u201cI just returned from the spirit base. All the spirits there are saying she is the heir of this Godslayer Luo guy, and that they\u2019re all planning to kill her as revenge or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine the all that is planning to kill her.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew this was going to happen, one way or another. Spirits were quite vengeful creatures, but none had yet learned he was the true heir to Godslayer Luo.\n\nHe didn\u2019t expect this to become an issue this far down the line, though, prompted by a misunderstanding.\n\nStill, he wasn\u2019t too afraid. Han Sen was an incredibly mighty person now, and he\u2019d do whatever it took to protect Zero, provided she even needed protection\u2014the wild and wonderful thing she was.\n\nMoment Queen went ahead to say, \u201cAll the spirits want to kill Zero. They know we are in her company. We\u2019re on our own out here. This is bad!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what can we do about it? We\u2019re not feeding Zero to the dogs, if that\u2019s what your poisonous heart is contemplating,\u201d Han Sen mused.\n\nMoment Queen suggested, \u201cWe go into hiding. We go underground, like, literally. We give this dump up for now. Go to the underground shelter, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about the humans we\u2019ve ensured the security of?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHan Sen had asserted control and assured the safety of many shelters by this point. There were many humans, far more than the underground shelter could offer refuge to.\n\n\u201cMaybe they can go hide in that Alliance place Xie Qing King likes to drone on about?\u201d Moment Queen offered.\n\nHan Sen rejected the idea, saying, \u201cNo. If we lose the shelters, we might as well off them ourselves.\u201d\n\nMoment Queen said, \u201cI fear you are having difficulty grasping the gravitas of the situation here. There are at least a dozen emperors coming, all looking to plant Zero\u2019s head on a pike. She\u2019s a remarkable fighter, I\u2019ll give her that, but this is a threat that is too much for any one person to even dream of defeating.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help her fight, and fine: tell the humans to return to the Alliance while we sort this out,\u201d Han Sen conceded.\n\n\u201cAnd how do you hope to stop this enemy force? It\u2019ll only take one punch off one of them to end our lives,\u201d Moment Queen thought Han Sen was overestimating his own talent. He was jeopardizing everything by being so cocky and boisterous, she believed.\n\nMoment Queen composed herself and then said, \u201cThe second, fourth, fifth, and seventh Son of Gods are on their way. We hide or we die, it\u2019s that simple!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them come. I will kill them all,\u201d Han Sen said, casually.\n\n\u201cYeah, what are you fussing about? Back in the day, when I had to face a siege, I didn\u2019t have any fancy-schmancy super creatures to heal. We had sticks! Two sticks, and a rock for the whole shelter\u2014and we had to share the rock! Buck up, girl, you are one very lucky spirit!\u201d Xie Qing King said, chucking the remainder of his beer away. It was difficult to tell if he was being serious or not.\n\n\u201cThis is madness!\u201d Moment Queen had no clue what was going through their minds anymore.\n\n\u201cMadness? This is the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary! Have some godd*mn faith, Moment Queen. I have a plan! So, for now, go and tell humans to return to the Alliance. Things are going to heat up, of course, but we\u2019ve weathered worse storms than this. They will not crush us,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nMoment Queen was unable to convince them to change their course of action, so she ended up having no choice but to abide by their decision. She notified the other shelters as she was told to.\n\nHan Sen then got deep into planning out how he was going to defeat what was coming and turn the tides in his favor. He wanted to take over the entire sanctuary, anyway.\n\nHan Sen had opened ten gene locks with Jadeskin, and with Little Angel by his side, slaying emperors should prove no problem, he thought.\n\nWith Zero and the silver fox\u2019s help, he wagered he\u2019d be able to take on thirty emperors without even breaking a sweat.\n\nThorn Queen came to Han Sen in a bit of a rush, and then she presented the snake egg. There were cracks running along the shell, suggesting it was about to hatch.\n\nNot long after, it all came apart as a red-scaled dragon emerged, saying, \u201cOh yeah! I\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cWell, you just remember to keep your end of this bargain. We made a deal, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! A hundred years is nothing. You are too kind!\u201d Dragon King was starting to talk more like a human now."
