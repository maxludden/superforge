    "text": "\u201cIf I go, it will save me three years of healing. I will also be given the support of the Very High. It is a great deal. But I will risk exposing my true identity. If I don\u2019t go, nothing bad will happen, but it will take me some time to heal. And while I\u2019m healing, there won\u2019t be much I can do to further myself. My ability to practice will be suspended, and I will have to locate my own resources.\u201d Han Sen was deep in thought the whole way home, wondering what he should do.\n\nAfter a while of deliberation, he decided to stay in Sky Palace. His recovery would only take a short time, anyway. And he could get his own resources. It would just be a slower process.\n\nBut if his identity was exposed, that would be very bad. It would affect the safety of the entire human race.\n\nWhen Han Sen returned to the little jade island, Lone Bamboo was there waiting for him. The man didn\u2019t look to be in poor condition. There was no sign in his countenance that he had just been released from prison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the Very High,\u201d was the first thing Lone Bamboo said. And that surprised Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhy the sudden change of heart?\u201d Han Sen asked Lone Bamboo with confusion. Lone Bamboo had been adamant about not going, and he had claimed that he would rather remain in prison. Now he was free, and he had changed his mind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, but I can\u2019t make you go in my stead. The way the situation stands, I have to go,\u201d Lone Bamboo said.\n\n\u201cSky Palace Leader said he can figure this out. Perhaps there is a way in which neither of us has to go,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nLone Bamboo shook his head. \u201cThere is no other way. We have to send someone, and that person is either you, me, or another Sky Palace student. So, I have decided that I will be the one to go to the Very High.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to use Uncle Yu Shanxin\u2019s Extreme Evil Path?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity. Lone Bamboo wasn\u2019t an easy person to sway. Han Sen was certain that Yu Shanxin would have offered his protection from the beginning. If Lone Bamboo wanted to choose this path, he could have from the beginning\n\nLone Bamboo shook his head again. \u201cUsing the Extreme Evil Path can avoid the prying eyes of the Very High, but it gives the user an evil mind. Evil will be watching you instead. You will still be watched, so it makes no difference.\u201d\n\nNow Han Sen understood. Yu Shanxin deliberately left out the most important part.\n\n\u201cThen what are you planning to do?\u201d Han Sen asked quietly.\n\nLone Bamboo quietly looked out across the clouds, and he said, \u201cThe Very High can feel everything I feel. So, all I must do is not think or feel anything. I will only do what they want me to do. Then, Exquisite will only see what I want her to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be a very difficult thing.\u201d Han Sen knew how hard that task would be.\n\nThere were many ways to control someone, but controlling yourself was harder. The most dangerous enemy a person had was always themselves.\n\nSo, Han Sen really admired Ning Yue. He had used a parasite beast soul to watch Ning Yue once before, and Ning Yue spent years practicing Buddhism. Han Sen was unable to glean any smidgen of information from Ning Yue. Han Sen didn\u2019t think he had that sort of patience.\n\nLone Bamboo was planning the same. He was going to use his power to control everything about his situation. He wasn\u2019t going to allow Exquisite to see all of his secrets.\n\nAlthough Han Sen knew Lone Bamboo was doing this because he didn\u2019t want Han Sen to be his replacement, there was nothing much he could say about it.\n\nIf he was alone, he would make the same decision as Lone Bamboo. He wouldn\u2019t mind fighting his inner demons.\n\nBut Han Sen had too much on the line. He was responsible for the countless lives in the sanctuaries. If his mind\u2019s fortitude failed, Exquisite would learn everything. He wouldn\u2019t only be hurting himself then. So, Han Sen couldn\u2019t afford to take that chance.\n\n\u201cBefore I go, there is something I would like you to do,\u201d Lone Bamboo said softly. This was the reason he was there.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cHelp me take care of a child. Her name is Flower,\u201d Lone Bamboo said. \u201cIs it a Sky Palace student? Is she related to you?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity.\n\nLone Bamboo shook his head. He thought for a moment, and then answered, \u201cHer and Purple-Eye Butterfly exist together. After I combined with the genes of Purple-Eye Butterfly, she became a part of me. She keeps wanting to kill me to avenge the death of Purple-Eye Butterfly. It might be a little annoying. So, after I go to the Very High, please take care of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds a bit tricky, but don\u2019t worry. If you want her to live, I will take care of her.\u201d Han Sen agreed to do this.\n\n\u201cThat is great.\u201d Lone Bamboo sighed. It was as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.\n\nTo other people, it was hard to imagine why Lone Bamboo would care so much about someone who wanted to kill him, but Han Sen could understand. So, he didn\u2019t ask anything more about it. Instead, he just asked for more information concerning the girl Flower.\n\nWhen Lone Bamboo took his leave, Han Sen felt something clench in his chest. He wished he could be like Lone Bamboo. He wouldn\u2019t mind going with the Very High, as it was just a battle of the mind. Ning Yue could do it and Lone Bamboo dared to. Could Han Sen not do it as well?\n\nBut then he thought about all the trouble he could bring down on the sanctuaries. Han Sen smiled wryly and shook his head to clear away the errant thoughts.\n\nHan Sen thought that the matter had been resolved, but then something happened that Han Sen and Lone Bamboo hadn\u2019t foreseen.\n\nExquisite now refused to take Lone Bamboo with her. She was only interested in taking Han Sen, and no other would be considered.\n\nThat made Han Sen freeze. When he realized what was going on, he wanted to slap himself in the face.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone to that meeting. Even if I went, why did I have to test my talent for all of them to see? And even if I took the test, why did I then go on to help the God Spirit Touch evolve? That was just asking for trouble.\u201d Han Sen cringed at his own stupidity.\n\nBut no one had expected the Very High to be so willing to change who they wanted. Han Sen should have been an outsider in these matters, but somehow, he had become the crux of it all.\n\nIf Han Sen knew this would happen, he would have stayed home and played games. He wouldn\u2019t have attended the meeting.\u201cI had it coming.\u201d Han Sen sighed.\n\n\u201cHan Sen! What do you think?\u201d As Han Sen was going to visit Sky Palace Leader, a smiling Yu Shanxin appeared next to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the Very High,\u201d Han Sen said emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cDo you need me to use Extreme Evil Path?\u201d Yu Shanxin asked with a smile.\n\n\u201cUncle Yu, you didn\u2019t tell me that the demon would spy on me, as well,\u201d Han Sen said with a smile.\n\n\u201cLetting me see things is better than others seeing things. We are a family. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Yu Shanxin said with a smile.\n\nHan Sen rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t bother responding. He and Yu Shanxin were on their way to the office. He had decided to go to the Very High. If he didn\u2019t, things would likely end poorly.\n\nPlus, Han Sen had found a way to fight against the spying of the Very High."
