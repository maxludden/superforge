Say something, would you?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nDragon King shook his head and said, \u201cThis is an Empress Coin, but first, tell me where you got it from.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what I want to know first. What does it do?\u201d Han Sen gave Dragon King an intense stare. He was still feeling a little sour from his horrid experience in the cave, so he wasn\u2019t in the mood to play games.\n\nDragon King smiled and said, \u201cThis thing is special. I can\u2019t just sum it up in two seconds.\u201d\n\nHan Sen sat down and gave Dragon King another look. Dragon King was able to tell Han Sen was not in a good mood. \u201cThere are many emperors in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and there are many empresses, as well. The most famous of all was Night Empress. Even Ancient Devil Emperor feared her.\u201d\n\nHan Sen picked up the coin and asked, \u201cIs this her geno treasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Dragon King answered.\n\nHan Sen gave him another stare, saying, \u201cThen why tell me this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Empress Coins are not geno treasures, but they did belong to Night Empress. They don\u2019t do anything, but perhaps they can be used to trade for something decent,\u201d Dragon King explained.\n\n\u201cWhat might I be able to trade it for?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King told him, \u201cDo you see the Night Empress on the coin? Don\u2019t you think she looks a little like the Lotus Queen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wondered that myself. Are they related?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cNight Empress is currently in the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary. Lotus Empress is her heir. When I came here, she had already built a name for herself and become famous.\u201d\n\nDragon King went on to explain, saying, \u201cLotus Queen likes to collect the coins of her mother. You could probably go and see her and exchange this coin for a lotus seed. You can push your luck and ask for more, but that is a decision I\u2019d best leave up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat good is a lotus seed?\u201d Han Sen inquired.\n\n\u201cThink about it! You could grow fruit worthy of an emperor. It\u2019d be great for opening gene locks. Only Lotus Queen can make these lotus seeds, too. They are highly sought after things,\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHan Sen looked at the coin and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re saying this coin is useless, why does the Lotus Queen want them so much? I imagine it\u2019s for more than simple sentimental value.\u201d\n\nDragon King said, \u201cPeople who possess Empress Coins have come to conclude that they are incredibly sturdy. Sturdy, but useless. Night Empress created thirteen of these coins and gave them to the king spirits she liked most.\u201d\n\nAlthough Han Sen believed the coins had a greater worth and purpose than he was being told, if he couldn\u2019t figure out what that was, the coin really would be useless. But he still thought swapping it for a few lotus seeds would make for a decent exchange. Opening more gene locks could never be frowned upon, after all.\n\nHis Dongxuan Sutra was coming along nicely, but Han Sen still felt as if its development was a bit too slow.\n\nLotus Empress had seen him in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary, though, and given him a mark. He was worried she might try to imprison him if he approached her.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I can get a spirit to do the exchange, in my stead,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nDragon King looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cSo, can you tell me where you got this coin from?\u201d\n\nHan Sen explained to him what had occurred with the little creature, but left out the part where he tried to assassinate the creature and got cruelly beat up by its family. He merely said he stole it from the nest after following it inside.\n\nDragon King was surprised, and he said, \u201cWow, you found a Metal Eater.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a\u2026 Metal Eater?\u201d Han Sen was unfamiliar with the name.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cYes, Metal Eaters are an infamous sort of super creature. They dine on metal and absorb the powers of it. The items in those rusted piles of junk were grand things, I imagine, once upon a time. It\u2019s just that their properties were absorbed by the creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it makes sense.\u201d Han Sen knew the rusted stuff had to be special.\n\n\u201cThat must have been why the Metal Eater took the coin. It\u2019s quite the artifact, and it is composed of a very resilient metal.\u201d Dragon King felt it was a shame, so he went on to say, \u201cI cannot believe there were six of them. You might have fared okay against one, but six? Not even an emperor would provoke those things, so I\u2019m glad you had the sense not to do anything stupid in there, like attacking the little one.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven emperors wouldn\u2019t provoke them?\u201d Han Sen gulped, almost unable to believe what he had just been told.\n\nDragon King smiled and said, \u201cMetal Eaters can become berserk super creatures. They can have greater vitality and defense than an emperor, and metal weapons are entirely ineffective against them. No emperor I know would approach one of those creatures with confidence, especially those with nine gene locks open. They are vengeful things, too. If you killed one, those that knew about it would hunt you down until the end of time.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was glad he did not kill the little one. If he had, he\u2019d have been in trouble.\n\nHan Sen was then very excited, thinking about something.\n\n\u201cThe little creature collected the coin from a burrow or hole in the ground. Do you think there might be something else inside?\u201d Han Sen asked, with a manic glint in his eye.\n\nDragon King said, \u201cIt is certainly possible, yes. I don\u2019t see why an Empress Coin would randomly appear there, of all places. And if there was something more there, it should still be there.\u201d\n\nNow, Han Sen\u2019s enthusiasm had been restored. He was wide awake and ready to go. He packed his stuff and left the shelter, wanting to go dig through the hole the creature first came out of. He was keen to find out if there was anything else inside."
