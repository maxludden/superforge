    "text": "Han Sen started running out of the lodge. The man might be lying, but it was better to run than risking everything by remaining. If Han Sen was transported to another star system, that\u2019d be pretty bad.\n\nWhen he made it some distance away, Han Sen turned around to face the man and ask, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft Crazy,\u201d the man answered.\n\nHan Sen wished to ask something more, but he felt the mountain begin to shake. Without hesitation, he said goodbye and hastily departed the mountain.\n\nBoom!\n\nWith the speed of his rabbit shoes aiding his flight, Han Sen was able to just about get off the mountain before hearing that deafening sound. The mountains all around were vibrating like mad, and when Han Sen turned back around to face where the mountain had been, he saw nothing. It was as if the mountain did not exist.\n\n\u201cHow did that mountain move so quickly? I thought the man said that rocks were slow.\u201d Cold sweat dripped off Han Sen\u2019s forehead. It was fortunate he had moved as fast as he had. If he hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have been long gone.\n\nHan Sen took a gander at the book he had been given by Left Crazy. There was no name, and it had all been written by hand.\n\n\u201cPetrify? That sounds so lame. It sounds like a skill that can make your skin as hard as stone,\u201d Han Sen thought, as he started to read the text.\n\nBut as he read, his expression turned to surprise. The skill was called petrify, and while the name was lame, the contents were impressive.\n\nIt was a complete geno art. From commoner to Baron, from Viscount to King, all could practice and become proficient with it. It had its own power.\n\nPracticing Petrify did not make your body harder, though. It would just make your body closer to that of the rocky creatures. Grystallizers were like hurrmns, so they couldiVt become like rocks completely. \u201cThe higher your petrification was, the closer to the life of a rock you\u2019d attune.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t become completely the same as a rock, you\u2019d only adopt some of their attributes. Petrify made humans and crystallizers petrified. It gave them the life of a rock.\n\nPetrify couldn\u2019t make someone impervious to death, but time had more difficulty leaving its marks on petrified bodies. Thousands of years result in many humans and crystallizers dying, but to a rock, it was only a moment. It did not affect them.\n\nHan Sen examined the requirements for bringing Petrify up to King class, if that was what he chose to do. At that point, he would have a life that was very similar to a rock\u2019s. And with a body like that, many millions of years could come and go without affecting him.\n\nThere was one significant flaw to Petrify, though. When you used it, your body really would turn to stone. You\u2019d be unable to move because of it. And your mind would still be there, active, too. The more you practiced the skill, the closer to the life of a rock you would get.\n\n\u201cIt sounds really cool, but it seems fairly useless. You\u2019d only turn into a rock, and rocks aren\u2019t hard enough to provide great protection. And you can\u2019t move, either. Why would that guy bother creating this skill?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nAfter a while, Han Sen was able to come up with a useful application for it.\n\n\u201cIf I can practice while petrified, then time would be of no issue for me. I could just keep practicing without eating or drinking.\u201d\n\nIn that case, Petrify might be really useful. He planned to learn it, thinking it might come in handy.\n\nPetrify was a geno art that allowed for the swapping of genes. It did not make your body better. You still needed a strength like The Story of Gene as a basis.\n\nHan Sen thought it was a crystallizer geno art, so he used The Story of Genes to practice with it.\n\nHan Sen found a safe cave to take refuge in, where he could practice Petrify. It was easier to learn than he expected. After casting it once, his skin started to feel rocky. Already, Han Sen could tell that he had learned the first tier of Petrify.\n\n\u201cHmm, that was much easier than I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d Han Sen then moved on to try the second tier. It was a Baron class Petrify.\n\nHan Sen finished Baron Petrify easily, too. He kept on going, and he realized that Petrify really was exceptionally easy to learn. He only spent two days practicing with it to get it all the way up to King class.\n\nAfter reaching King class, he noticed Left Crazy had not written anything more. That was likely due to the fact he had yet to reach that level. He guessed that after the King level, you could actually become petrified.\n\nWithout a skill that would teach him how to proceed, Han Sen decided to try other things.\n\nIf he became a rock and was unable to return to a human form, then his life would be over.\n\n\u201cWhy is it like that? According to Left Crazy, you had to reach a certain level before practicing such a skill. So, why did nothing stop him from reaching King class? Is it because of The Story of Genes?\u201d Han Sen guessed a number of things, but he wasn\u2019t sure enough to put stock in anything.\n\nHan Sen tried using his Petrify, and he learned other geno arts could not be practiced as long as it was in use. That was because Petrify made a big change to the body. Geno arts for the human body were useless. Only The Story of Genes could run while he was in a petrified state.\n\n\u201cThis geno art is so weird. Although it can take you to a very high level, its usefulness is practically nonexistent.\u201d Losing interest in Petrify, Han Sen decided to return to practicing with the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nHan Sen remained in the mountains for an entire month. He fought and practiced with his Dongxuan Sutra a great amount. Dongxuan Sutra was on the precipice of breaking through, but it had yet to do so.\n\nThere were ten days left before the red mist spring erupted. After realizing this, Han Sen decided it was time to leave the mountains and head to the spring. His Spell Geno Armament required this spring so it could become a Viscount. He couldn\u2019t afford to miss this opportunity.\n\nBefore long, Han Sen was right outside Red Mist Valley. There were hordes of xenogeneics wandering around, and it was clear they had all come there for the red mist spring, as well.\n\nThey all hung outside the valley. None of them had entered the mist yet. They were waiting for the spring to erupt.\n\nHan Sen looked around. The xenogeneics there were Baron or Viscount. There were no higher level sorts.\n\nYisha told Han Sen that the red mist spring only worked for Viscounts. It would be ineffective on those of a higher level, so, there was no point in high class xenogeneics coming."
