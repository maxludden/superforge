    "text": "Han Sen didn\u2019t bother to contradict her again. He followed the big group across the desert.\n\nThere was a huge crowd around them initially, but many people quickly began to tire and turn back.\n\nThere was no day and night cycle in Heaven, and the sun was always high in the sky. After ten hours, the sun was still unmoved.\n\nIt was just as Hai\u2019er said, too. The heavenly voice was nearly impossible to ignore. It wasn\u2019t long until Han Sen saw weaker-willed creatures beginning to dance along with the music. A giant danced across the sand. An initial glance might seem amusing, but it ultimately gave onlookers the chills.\n\nMany groups of people walked together. If anyone started dancing with the music, others could snap them out of it. Some creatures that were having difficulty withstanding the music, and they decided to turn back. They didn\u2019t want to risk dying there.\n\nThe music did not affect Han Sen at all, though. He heard it, but it was just annoying, more than anything. Hai\u2019er kept on bugging Han Sen about when he was going to meet up with Speechless, but he was too lazy to answer her.\n\nHai\u2019er refused to give it up, though. He eventually couldn\u2019t stand it. He frowned and asked, \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m in a relationship with her?\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er smiled and said, \u201cI am a woman, too. The way she looked at you could not fool me. Can you swear to God that there\u2019s nothing between you two?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shrugged and did not say another word. He continued walking.\n\nThere was no nighttime in that desert. No one knew the specific direction they should be moving, which eventually resulted in the large crowds splitting up as people ventured separate ways. Most of them continued going forward, though. And that meant they were headed west.\n\nHan Sen was going west, as well. But as time went by, there were fewer and fewer people around him. The desert was too large.\n\nAfter fifty hours of this, aside from Hai\u2019er, there was no one nearby.\n\nHai\u2019er kept walking and asked, \u201cHan Sen, I can\u2019t see anyone close to us. Speechless should be here!\u201d\n\nHan Sen acted like he didn\u2019t hear anything. He merely stroked Bubble, which was perched on his shoulder, and asked, \u201cDid you bring a Magic? What do they do?\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er said, \u201cThey aren\u2019t affected by the music. You can use them for a distraction from the music. It keeps your mind from being so easily lured by the heavenly music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d Han Sen had guessed that, but he just wanted confirmation.\n\n\u201cStop beating around the bush: when is Speechless getting here?\u201d Hai\u2019er asked in irritation.\n\nAs Han Sen started to respond, a shadow appeared over the horizon. They looked in its direction and saw a Buddha with a white robe. The bald head gleamed under the radiance of the sun.\n\n\u201cYou see? There is no way I could have been mistaken.\u201d Hai\u2019er looked cocky.\n\n\u201cLook closer; it\u2019s a man. It\u2019s not Speechless,\u201d Han Sen said after a second.\n\nYou\u2019re still pretending? Speechless must have sent that man to pick you up. You cannot lie to me.\u201d Hai\u2019er gave him a you cannot lie to me face.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face suddenly looked rather pale, and his eyes twitched. He had picked up a very hostile aura coming from that man.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Han Sen turned around and started to leave.\n\n\u201cStop playing,\u201d Hai\u2019er said with an eye-roll, but then she realized that Han Sen was already running off.\n\nHai\u2019er turned to look at the Buddha and found that he had accelerated. He was coming towards her like an arrow. She felt something was amiss now, too, and so she ran after Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWho is that? Isn\u2019t he here to pick you up?\u201d Hai\u2019er asked as she ran.\n\n\u201cI already told you; I have nothing to do with Speechless,\u201d Han Sen said again.\n\nHai\u2019er turned her head to look behind them, and she saw the Buddha getting closer. She was shocked, and said, \u201cIf you have nothing to do with her, why are they chasing you? They must have unearthed your dirty secret, and that\u2019s why that man has been dispatched to get rid of you!\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er looked at the man more closely, then screamed. \u201cSeven Spirit Buddha! I was right. You and Speechless have been exposed. This Buddha has been sent to kill you.\u201d\n\n\u2019You recognize him?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know why one of the Buddha would come after him. And since their pursuer was undoubtedly a hostile, Han Sen wanted to know more about him.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of Seven Spirit Buddha? He is Speechless Buddha King\u2019s seventh son, but the Buddha King did not leave anything to him in his will. He gave everything to Speechless. Seven Spirit Buddha wasn\u2019t denied an inheritance because he was a disappointment, but because he was too smart. Speechless Buddha King was afraid that his will might limit and actually impede Seven Spirit\u2019s future. So, nothing was left for him. Burning Lamp Alpha himself refused to take students for a thousand years, but decades ago, he made an exception for Seven Spirit Buddha. He must be a Marquise by now.\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er went on to say, \u201cThe relationship between you and Speechless must have been exposed. That is why he is here to kill you. So, since this has nothing to do with me, I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Hai\u2019er changed course and ran the other way. She wanted to get as far away from Han Sen as she could to avoid getting mixed up in his mess.\n\nHan Sen suddenly sped up, though, and he grabbed Hai\u2019er by the clothes. He picked her up and continued running.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? I thought we were friends! Don\u2019t harm me!\u201d Hai\u2019er struggled, trying to escape.\n\n\u201cI am Knife Queen\u2019s student. The Rebate and the Buddha have a good relationship. If they wanted to kill me, do you think they would allow witnesses to know that I was murdered?\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\nHai\u2019er was shocked, and so she stopped resisting. She said, \u201cWe should run separate ways, then. He might not come after me. It\u2019s better than dying with you, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a Viscount. If I was the Seven Spirit Buddha, I\u2019d kill you before coming after me,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019re really strong, but you\u2019re a Viscount the same as me.\u201d Hai\u2019er smiled.\n\nBut after she said that, she felt Han Sen tucking her under his armpit. Then he accelerated to a point where she could not even open her eyes for the wind.\n\n\u201cHow is he so fast?\u201d Hai\u2019er was shocked."
