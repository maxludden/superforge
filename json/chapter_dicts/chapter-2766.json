    "text": "\u201cIf I said I was lost, would you believe me?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nBarr raised his eyebrows at the answer. He gave Han Sen a weird look and said, \u201cYou are lost out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an underdeveloped, barren area. It isn\u2019t far from a large barren system. As for precisely where we are, I can\u2019t really tell you. After all, this place is mostly unexplored. There are no maps here,\u201d Barr said.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He thought to himself, \u201cA big barren system? That means it most likely belonged to Sacred in ancient times. It is an entrance to the sanctuaries. This was the place that Old Cat brought Littleflower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing in such a dangerous place?\u201d Han Sen asked Barr.\n\n\u201cThis place isn\u2019t a large barren system, so it isn\u2019t too dangerous. It is just a poor system with few resources, but a small race here discovered a xenogeneic space. They claimed they found something awesome here. That is why I have come out here to look.\u201d Barr looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cAre you interested in visiting this xenogeneic space to check?\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t answer. The few deified elites that were accompanying Barr approached him. One of them smiled and said, \u201cBarr, why don\u2019t you introduce us to this friend of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the human called Dollar. He was the Marquise winner of the last Geno Being Scroll,\u201d Barr explained to the deified, his voice carrying a modicum of respect. He was quite polite to this other Destroyed.\n\nAfter that, Barr pointed at the deified elite and said, \u201cDollar, this is the Destroyed\u2019s transmutation deified. He is Elder Nader.\u201d\n\nBarr didn\u2019t introduce the other people around Elder Nader. He only said they were students of Elder Nader.\n\nThey were all just Kings or half-deifieds. Barr himself was already deified, and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to introduce them all.\n\nElder Nader could see that Barr was being very friendly to Han Sen. He thought Han Sen had to be an elite from some big race, but he was just some scion of a smaller race. The man swiftly lost interest, and he only addressed the occasional casual remark toward Han Sen.\n\nDollar had reached first place in the Marquise Geno Being Scroll, but Marquises were very different from deifieds. Nader thought he had no reason to take a deified that came from a small race seriously.\n\nAlthough it was difficult to become deified, the smaller races occasionally got lucky. They might stumble upon a treasure or get their hands on a resource from a stronger race and become deified.\n\nBut deifieds like that always had a bad base. They lacked knowledge and practical skills, and they were likely to cause trouble.\n\nThe Destroyed had previously adopted a few deifieds like that, but showing such benevolence had never worked out well for the Destroyed. The deifieds did little to benefit the Destroyed, and instead, they were a frequent pain in the *ss for their host race. Ever since then, the Destroyed had stopped recruiting deifieds from smaller races. They would rather raise their own elites.\n\nIf Han Sen had been from a big race, Elder Nader would have liked to talk to him. But after learning who Dollar was, he was no longer interested.\n\nElder Nader might not take Han Sen seriously, but Barr knew about Dollar through Dia Robber. Even Dia Robber really admired the elusive Dollar, so Barr would never think about underestimating him.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, if there is nothing else for you to do here, how about you come with us to explore that xenogeneic space?\u201d Barr said, inviting Han Sen along again.\n\n\u201cWe can explore together, but if we get something good, how will we split it?\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t really interested in a xenogeneic space, but he didn\u2019t know much about this system. Following Barr and the others might save him from some trouble in the future.\n\n\u201cElder Nader is a transmutation deified. He has the most power here. He will take 60% of the goods. How about we split the other 40% between you and me?\u201d Barr suggested after a moment of silence.\n\nElder Nader wasn\u2019t very happy about that proposition. In his eyes, Dollar was just a primitive deified. Twenty percent was too much, he believed. Dollar shouldn\u2019t receive any more than ten percent.\n\nBut since Barr had already made the offer, Elder Nader wasn\u2019t going to embarrass the man by stepping on his toes. He remained quiet.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t very fair. Never mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, how would you suggest we split it? You can tell us.\u201d Barr knew this adventure would be dangerous. Having an elite like Dollar would benefit their mission quite a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always very fair. If this is a co-operation, I think we should split the rewards 50/50. The Destroyed get 50, and the humans get 50,\u201d Han Sen said seriously.\n\nFury swept through Elder Nader and his students, and they wanted to burst out crying and laughing at the same time.\n\nHe had already been a little upset about the prospect of Han Sen receiving 20%, but he knew that discovering a new xenogeneic space could be a dangerous and weird adventure. Enlisting the help of an extra deified was a good idea. He wouldn\u2019t have agreed to the 20% offer if he hadn\u2019t understood that having Han Sen along could prove useful. But now, Han Sen wanted 50% of the total goods. That was too ridiculous.\n\n\u201cSmall races have their diminutive status for a reason. After becoming deified, they do tend to become full of themselves. I\u2019m afraid he doesn\u2019t even know the difference between a primitive deified and a transmutation deified. And he wants to split the goods 50/50?\u201d Elder Nader was angered by the suggestion. He looked at Han Sen and snorted. \u201cIf you were a larva deified, I would consider 50/50.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am primitive. I will only accept 50/50.\u201d Han Sen stood his ground.\n\nEven though he was only primitive, his body was incredibly strong, and he had studied many geno arts. Even ordinary transmutation deifieds couldn\u2019t really defeat Han Sen. So, Han Sen believed 50/50 was fair.\n\nBut Elder Nader was not of the same opinion. After hearing Han Sen, he laughed. \u201cYour stomach is too big. We can\u2019t feed you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, I have to go,\u201d Han Sen said. Then, he turned to Barr and told him, \u201cBrother Barr, do you have a star map I can purchase? I would really appreciate it if you could sell one to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just a star map. It isn\u2019t worth much. Just take it, if you need it.\u201d Barr opened his communicator and sent the star map to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot. We will meet again, Brother Barr.\u201d Han Sen accepted it and nodded his thanks.\n\nSeeing Han Sen leave, one of Elder Nader\u2019s students laughed. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t know his place. He thinks that becoming deified has made him invincible in the universe. A deified like him, who doesn\u2019t know his place, is as insubstantial as smoke. There is nothing for him to be cocky about.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he is just a primitive deified. Our master could squeeze him to death with one hand. Why be so polite to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid he doesn\u2019t understand how much difference there is between a primitive and a transmutation. That is why he was so confident. Master, you should take this into your own hands and show him who the boss is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho gave him the confidence to suggest going 50/50 with the master?\u201d\n\nThe students kept talking and judging Han Sen. They sounded as if they were all stronger than Han Sen. They had clearly forgotten that they were all Kings and Han Sen was deified."
