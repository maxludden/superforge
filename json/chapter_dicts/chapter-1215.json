I am associated with the element of thorns, and I am a king spirit. While it is still young, I can take it.\u201d Thorn Queen paused for a moment, before going on to say, \u201cWith this flower, I might even become an emperor. Although the chance of that occurring is low, it is better than leaving it here for naught.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can take it, then by all means do,\u201d Han Sen politely told her. If she could really become an emperor, it was a win-win for them both.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Thorn Queen looked incredibly happy, and she jovially pranced over towards the hellpool.\n\nHan Sen watched as her legs began to grow vines. They stroked the water, allowing her to glide across to where the flower was. The pool was only ten meters wide, and the flower was at its center. But strangely, she had to walk over ten thousand steps in her voyage towards it.\n\n\u201cWeird,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nBao\u2019er sat on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder. She looked at Thorn Queen and the flower, but she did not seem at all interested in it.\n\nSnowball watched Thorn Queen, too, but his attitude was different. He knew about this place, and the mysteries it held, so he was more than surprised to see that Thorn Queen had the ability to cross the hellpool. He had never seen another being able to do such a thing before.\n\nAs for the egg, it had not rolled itself there, so something must have had a hand in its placement.\n\nPerhaps the mother Ghost-Toxic Chi had some association with the pool, but without appropriate cause or reason, it seemed unlikely that a mother would place her egg here, of all places.\n\nSnowball could go there because he was special, and he didn\u2019t think there was any danger for him, as long as he did not venture too close to the flower.\n\nAmidst Snowball\u2019s surprise, Thorn Queen had managed to reach the flower and pick it up. The flower had no roots, and it was very much like a cut rose one could purchase. It looked like a simple act to the eyes of most, but it was something that shocked Snowball.\n\nSnowball had seen many other super creatures attempt to grab the flower, but they had disappeared into the nether. And now, it had effortlessly been picked up by someone he had never seen before.\n\nHan Sen was disappointed, though. She made the flower sound so mysterious, but there was no spectacle when she retrieved it. But directly after the flower was collected, a snake-like creature appeared. It swam towards the flower that had been collected with great haste.\n\nThe waters swirled to form a wave that splashed towards the flower. But when the waters surrounded it, they formed together to create a single waterdrop. Then, it gracefully fell inside.\n\n\u201cMaster! I will keep the egg in the hellwater. You may take it whenever you decide,\u201d Thorn Queen said as she took the flower.\n\n\u201cOkay. Understood.\u201d Han Sen then returned Thorn Queen to the Sea of Soul and took Bao\u2019er with him as he exited the cave.\n\nDragon King, as all this had been occurring, was still looking for the egg by himself. Han Sen went to sit someplace where he wouldn\u2019t be bothered and started to absorb the Ghost-Toxic Chi\u2019s Life Geno Essence.\n\n\u201cLife Geno Essence Absorbed; Super Geno Point +1.\u201d\n\nThe Life Geno Essence provided Han Sen five super geno points, in total. This brought his total tally up to the number of thirty-three.\n\nThe results of this venture had satisfied Han Sen a lot. He had obtained toxic gear and five super geno points, and he had managed to obtain a new pet in the form of Snowball.\n\nThe Equinox Flower and the possibilities it held were just the icing on the cake. If it hadn\u2019t been for the flower, he wagered Thorn Queen would not have finished her evolution yet.\n\n\u201cWhere is it? Where is it? Did you find it?\u201d Dragon King said.\n\nHe had looked into every nook and cranny but been unsuccessful in his search for the super creature egg.\n\nHan Sen knew this, and he told him, \u201cNope. I\u2019m starting to think we\u2019ll never find it, either. If you tell me the whole story, concerning Asura and Ancient Devil, I might be more inclined to continue the search and feel compelled to help you out.\u201d\n\nDragon King said to Han Sen, \u201cIsn\u2019t that convenient. I bet you already have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHan Sen responded by saying, \u201cBefore I let you out, I didn\u2019t even know what a dummy egg was. How would I know which is the correct egg, even if I did come across it?\u201d\n\nDragon King didn\u2019t believe Han Sen, though. If he hadn\u2019t found the egg, he wouldn\u2019t have offered such a bargain. But Han Sen didn\u2019t care too much about what he thought.\n\n\u201cTell me the story and I\u2019ll help. That\u2019s the bottom line here,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen thought he\u2019d be willing to do anything for a new body, but Dragon King simply gritted his teeth and returned to the ring of his own volition.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, I wonder? Why is he not willing to say a word about this matter?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nHan Sen only wanted to find out the relationship between the shura and Asura.\n\nIf he could figure out the connection there, it\u2019d help elucidate many other pressing questions and mysteries he had.\n\nBut with Dragon King still firm in keeping his mouth shut, there was nothing Han Sen could do right now. So, Han Sen turned his attention back to Snowball and said to him, \u201cTake me to the peak.\u201d\n\nSnowball looked scared, and he shook his little head.\n\nHan Sen knew this creature was something of a wimp, so he ended up having to use the contract to force Snowball to lead him up. Snowball no longer had a choice regarding anything anymore."
