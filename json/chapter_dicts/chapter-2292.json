    "text": "The prisoner approached Han Sen. Although he walked slowly, he was already very close to them. A second later, he was directly behind Han Sen.\n\nAs the prisoner walked, his cuffs clinked and clanked. When he came to a stop behind Han Sen, he fell completely silent. Han Sen couldn\u2019t even hear the prisoner breathing or his heart beating. It was as if he no longer existed.\n\nHan Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the prisoner, but he was shocked to find that he could no longer detect the prisoner\u2019s presence. Goosebumps flared across Han Sen\u2019s body.\n\nThe prisoner was standing directly behind him, but he could not feel the strange, chained man. His inability to detect the creature deeply unsettled Han Sen. He wanted to just run away as fast as he could. But he was currently casting the red bird spell; if he left his position, then the Four Symbols Seal would break. If any of the four tried to run, they\u2019d all end up dead.\n\nThe bird\u2019s nest still sat on Han Sen\u2019s head. He forced himself not to turn around, and he thought to himself, \u201cSo what if you are behind me? You can\u2019t break this bird\u2019s nest. I have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stood where he was and did not move. He did not dare turn and look behind him. He continued to cast his powers through the red bird spell to keep the trapped xenogeneic suppressed.\n\nBut when Han Sen looked at Mister White and the others, he was given a shock.\n\nMister White\u2019s face looked strange, but Han Sen couldn\u2019t accurately read the man\u2019s expression. Crime\u2019s expression was easier to interpret, though. He was in massive shock. He stared behind Han Sen with wide eyes, as if he had seen a ghost.\n\nThe blood kirin\u2019s response was even more dramatic. It was growling at Han Sen, as if in an urgent warning.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing behind me?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart felt chilled. He still couldn\u2019t detect the presence behind him. It was as if the chained man wasn\u2019t actually a creature at all, but some specter of death itself.\n\nMister White gulped. He looked pale, but still, he didn\u2019t say a word.\n\nHis expression made Han Sen even more worried. Han Sen could no longer help it, so he moved his head to take a look. He couldn\u2019t turn his head very far, though, because if he moved his hands or body he could disrupt the casting. After twisting his head to the left, he saw nothing.\n\nThen, he looked right. And still, he couldn\u2019t see anything. Han Sen wished he could just twist his body around so he could properly see what the prisoner was doing. But he really couldn\u2019t move his body.\n\nHan Sen couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the others\u2019 horrified expressions, though. Their vision lingered on the space behind Han Sen, which made his heart tremble in fear.\n\n\u201cF*ck you! I have a bird\u2019s nest to protect me, and I have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d Han Sen gritted his teeth and did not move.\n\nBut suddenly, Han Sen felt a chill run down his neck. It felt as if something was blowing a cold breath over his neck. Han Sen\u2019s skin prickled as his back turned sore and his legs went soft.\n\nHan Sen had seen many scary things in his lifetime, so he didn\u2019t frighten easily. But not being able to see the prisoner was deeply disturbing. He felt a deep chill in his heart.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Mister White called to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing behind me?\u201d Han Sen asked, his voice tense.\n\nIt was a shame that the blood kirin couldn\u2019t speak. If it had been able to talk, Han Sen would have asked it. Crime wasn\u2019t trustworthy enough for Han Sen to bother asking him, though.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 hard to explain.\u201d Mister White frowned, and he looked poorly. It seemed as if he didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nSeeing Mister White\u2019s hesitation made Han Sen frown. He had no clue what was going on behind him.\n\nIf Han Sen was in danger, Crime and Mister White probably wouldn\u2019t want to tell him, because they wouldn\u2019t want to risk Han Sen moving and breaking the Four Symbols Seal. However, Han Sen didn\u2019t think that was the reason for their behavior.\n\nIf Han Sen was attacked and wounded, then the Four Symbols Seal would break, anyway. They wouldn\u2019t stay silent and tell him not to move.\n\n\u201cIf there is no actual danger, then why can they not tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Han Sen wondered.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s attempts to figure out what was happening were getting him nowhere, but his back felt colder and colder. His worry continued to deepen.\n\nMister White and Crime were still staring at the space behind him. The blood kirin kept growling at Han Sen, as if it wished to tell him something.\n\nHan Sen could no longer resist the temptation. He summoned Bao\u2019er and asked her to take a look at the prisoner behind him.\n\nBao\u2019er appeared on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder. Han Sen spoke to her, \u201cBao\u2019er, help your daddy take a look at what this thing is doing behind him.\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er nodded. She leaned over his shoulder and took a look behind him. She jerked in surprise and said, \u201cDad\u2026 behind you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is behind me?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked.\n\n\u201cThere is a man drawing on your back,\u201d Bao\u2019er said, after thinking.\n\n\u201cDrawing?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s mind went blank for a minute. He was confused, and so he thought, \u201cThe prisoner is drawing something on my back? Is he an artist? Does he love drawing on humans? Is my body too good, and he could not help but use my fine figure for a canvas? No way! If he was fond of drawing on bodies, then he should have gone and found a pretty girl to paint upon. Why bother drawing on me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, what is he drawing?\u201d Han Sen quickly asked. Something else had to be going on here. Bao\u2019er leaned further over Han Sen\u2019s shoulder, peering at Han Sen\u2019s back, but she didn\u2019t speak.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, what is he drawing?\u201d Han Sen squeaked. He wasn\u2019t scared, he told himself. He just didn\u2019t like it.\n\nBao\u2019er hesitated, but she eventually said, \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 It\u2019s like the creature is drawing a person\u2026 Yeah, a woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman? What kind of woman?\u201d Han Sen was frozen. A skeletal prisoner had appeared out of nowhere, slinked up to his back, and started drawing a woman on him. This was too f*cking creepy, and it made Han Sen feel itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nBao\u2019er didn\u2019t seem to know how she might describe what she saw. With hesitation, she said, \u201cAn ugly, ugly woman.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt his pulse pounding in his temples. An ugly prisoner was now drawing an ugly woman on his back. What the f*ck was happening?\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mouth was wide open. He tried to ask another question, but he had no idea what he should ask.\n\nBao\u2019er observed his back some more, and then she said, \u201cDad, he cannot draw anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Han Sen asked curiously.\n\nBao\u2019er responded quickly this time. \u201cThe blood of the woman coming from his hands is running dry, and there is no more paint left.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? He is using a woman\u2019s blood to draw on my back?\u201d Han Sen felt as if his head was going to explode. He could not imagine the scene behind him."
