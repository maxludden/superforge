    "text": "Han Sen brought Ji Yanran, Bao\u2019er, and Zero with him on the spacecraft to visit Otto Planet. Otto Planet was one big holiday resort, and a single ticket was all it took for a visitor to enjoy the plethora of services available there.\n\nChasing respite, you could eat and play to your heart\u2019s content. After being given access to the planet, everything there was free. Aside from the caveat that you couldn\u2019t take anything home with you, as that would be theft.\n\nSince only the most high-class citizens could typically afford a vacation planet, tickets were very expensive. Those who went there were the sorts with fat wallets and thick purses.\n\nAnd for certain additional services, people were expected to open said currency holders to experience them.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s ticket was all-inclusive, however. He would be able to enjoy every single service available at his own pleasure and disclosure. Nothing was off-limits for his visit.\n\nThat being said, he wasn\u2019t interested in making use of any of the special services. He was happy enough with what the ordinary tickets provided.\n\nRight now, Bao\u2019er was playing with an animal that looked like an over-sized, brightly-capped mushroom. This, like the rest of Planet Otto\u2019s wildlife, was a tame creature. The animals that roamed the planet were mostly docile, friendly, and highly intelligent. Mushroom-like creatures were also the dominant species, able to be seen more than any other animal. They were plush, cuddly, and lacking limbs. Whether that was their reason for not being hostile was up for debate.\n\nHan Sen and Ji Yanran were in the sea, enjoying the water and sunshine.\n\nZero, was spread out on the beach, gorging on a slightly-concerning swathe of foods and drinks.\n\nHan Sen suddenly recalled that he hadn\u2019t yet uploaded the second volume of Overbearing President Love Luv Looove!\n\nNot wanting to disappoint his friend, no matter how eccentric he may have been, Han Sen decided to depart the sea and return to the beach to sort out what he had promised Xie Qing King.\n\nHe separated the chapters and set them up for automatic release at a certain time each and every day.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d As Han Sen was sorting it out, a woman spoke to him in a hushed, almost-trembling tone.\n\nHan Sen looked up and saw two girls standing nearby. They looked to be about eighteen years old, and the way they stood was almost as if they were unsure if they might be provoking a wild animal.\n\n\u201cMay I help you, ladies?\u201d Han Sen asked the two.\n\nAs he did, he thought to himself, \u201cIt sucks to be famous. Not even sunglasses can hide my hot looks. Perhaps I should get a pair for my abs, too. And in regards to having so many fans, I should really work on my signature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you Xie Qing King?\u201d The girls had a jittery stance, and the pitch of their voices was erratic.\n\n\u201cXie Qing King? No!\u201d Han Sen vehemently denied it.\n\n\u201cWell, we happened to see you uploading the second volume just now\u2026 but don\u2019t worry! We won\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re him. Oh, gosh! We are your biggest fans. And the wait for a new volume has been SO painful!\u201d The initial nervousness of the girls had been washed away by a sudden burst of excitement, and they now spoke to Han Sen with a near-rabid look in their eyes.\n\nHan Sen tried telling them he wasn\u2019t Xie Qing King, but nothing he said made them believe it. They just thought he was being humble, and not fond of the limelight.\n\n\u201cBossman, your secret is ours. We pledge this to you. We won\u2019t whisper this to another soul. You can count on it!\u201d the girls said, and then they left, giggling violently to themselves.\n\nHan Sen quickly opened Skynet and hurried over to the website he had released Xie Qing King\u2019s comic on.\n\n\u201cKeep going, Bossman! Don\u2019t let it end here. I\u2019m really loving your comic. If you ever need a baby-maker, I\u2019m your gal! PM me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lady with long legs and big boobs is seeking your love.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister President, feel free to arrange a hookup so you can fondle my boobs to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister President, I\u2019ve just hit eighteen. I suppose now I can leave you my number for some raunchy fun\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my God. Capital G. You saved my soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister President, when is the next release? Please update the comic with a new volume. I\u2019m dying to find out what happens next.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill no new update? I\u2019m jonesing for my next fix here.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe comic was far more popular than Han Sen could have anticipated.\n\nAcross the entire Webcomic community, the comic had surged from the lowly positions of unknown authors without an established fandom to the lofty position of number two on the Power Rankings chart.\n\nIt was quite the surprise, considering updates were so infrequent. It had been half a month since the last update, so its continued charting was something that was almost unheard of. The Power Rankings were a fickle thing, too.\n\nIf the updates came at a steady pace, it\u2019d undoubtedly reach first place on the chart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a super aristocrat. How can Xie Qing King write some ridiculous comic and achieve such widespread fame and acclaim?\u201d Han Sen felt as if he had been short-changed.\n\n\u201cPah! Quite the charmer, huh? What did you do this time to end up merrily chatting with two young girls while your wife was left to swim alone?\u201d Han Sen turned around to see Ji Yanran, with a fire blazing in her eyes.\n\nFew things terrified Han Sen. He could stand up to Emperor-class spirits without fear, but before his wife\u2019s scorn, his knees were jelly and his resolve was wet salt.\n\n\u201cNo, you misunderstand! You\u2019ve misunderstood the misunderstanding. They were talking with who they believed to be Xie Qing King!\u201d\n\nAfter that, Han Sen did his best to explain who Xie Qing King was. And then he proceeded to tell her about the comic. Ji Yanran had encountered spirits before, but she had never forged a friendship with one, as Han Sen did with many.\n\n\u201cI thought spirits were all heinous, murdering, hall-dwelling, boss-battle-type fiends?\u201d Ji Yanran said, with a confused look.\n\n\u201cMany of them are, but Xie Qing King is special, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen then turned to look at Bao\u2019er, who seemed to have grown a following of her own. She was more popular than the much-adored wildlife of the resort, judging from the crowd that had gathered.\n\nHan Sen then saw the group approach, with a short-haired girl carrying Bao\u2019er in her arms.\n\n\u201cI am a professional warframe operator of the Alliance. My name is Xia Yuxin; are you Bao\u2019er\u2019s father?\u201d The girl was polite in her introduction and subsequent questioning.\n\n\u201cYes. Has she been misbehaving again?\u201d Han Sen asked, standing up.\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s a delightful thing. But she did mention her father was a remarkable warframe operator, and even went so far as to strike up a bet on your behalf. If you win, we\u2019ll deliver a shipload of candy to her from my home planet. If you lose, we are provided the opportunity to spend a few days in Bao\u2019er\u2019s company,\u201d Xie Yuxin explained succinctly, not wanting a misunderstanding.\n\nHan Sen looked at Bao\u2019er, who was staring back at him with pleading eyes. She clearly wanted Han Sen to take the woman up on the bet. But it was clear to Han Sen that all she wanted was the candy that was up for grabs.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s have a match.\u201d Han Sen smiled."
