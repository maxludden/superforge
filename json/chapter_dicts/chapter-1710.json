    "text": "In the dark holes, there was something red like lanterns shining. When the red lights rose to the surface, they were revealed to be the triangularly-shaped heads of snakes. The red lights were their gleaming eyes.\n\nNow, black things were pouring out of the dark holes. They came straight for Han Sen, making a sharp noise.\n\nHan Sen was startled as he looked at them. Old Cat had already escaped with incredible speed.\n\n\u201cXie Qing, run!\u201d Han Sen shouted and started to run.\n\nThey did not know what those black-scaled snakes were, but if Old Cat had run away upon seeing them, they thought it was a good idea to follow after him.\n\nXie Qing King did not want to run, but he obliged Han Sen\u2019s request and went along with him.\n\nThe toxic snakes were coming at them like a breaking tide. They were very fast, but thankfully, they were slower than Han Sen.\n\nThe trio kept on running as fast as they could. But a while later, the snakes appeared in front of them. The greenhouse also ended up in front of them, too. Somehow, through means unknown, they had been forced to make another loop.\n\nNow that they had snakes in front and behind, they were firmly sandwiched.\n\nSeeing the groups of snakes gathering together, Xie Qing King unleashed a silver light. His fists were like a volcano, spewing silver fire as he threw them forward to punch the black snakes.\n\n\u201cAlu-Alu-Alu!\u201d The raging fists of silver light killed a vast number the black-scaled snakes upon contact. The toxic blood was thrown everywhere.\n\n\u201cI thought these things were something scary! They\u2019re this weak?\u201d When Xie Qing King stopped punching, the place had undergone a makeover to look like a slaughterhouse. The bodies of the snakes were everywhere, and not a single one had survived his rampage.\n\nOld Cat looked at him as if he were an idiot, and he said, \u201cAre you stupid? If this was that easy to deal with, why would we have run? You killed so many of those snakes, she is going to go mental!\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Cat, what do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nOld Cat did not answer. An explosion came from the greenhouse, one that sounded like the earth tearing apart. Something emerged from the ground.\n\nIt was a person with long hair and a beautiful body. Or at least the upper-part was, for the lower body was a slithering snake. She\u2019d have been a beautiful woman if she was a complete one.\n\nShe opened her eyes, but there were no pupils. She even had the eyes of a snake. She stared at the three of them intensely.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound. Her vision is bad, so there is a chance she\u2019ll be unable to see us right here,\u201d Old Cat told them, retreating to the side.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t see, but she\u2019s not deaf. You\u2019re so loud, she\u2019ll certainly hear you,\u201d Xie Qing King said, not moving.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t hear, either. She can see moving objects, so if we don\u2019t move, she won\u2019t be able to see us,\u201d Old Cat said.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King did not believe him, but when Lady Snake came out, she made a noise with her tongue but did nothing else. She didn\u2019t pay them any attention.\n\nLady Snake moved around a bit, but it appeared as if she couldn\u2019t see the three of them. It was as if she was moving around in search of something.\n\n\u201cShe really can\u2019t hear or see us? If that\u2019s the case, why are we afraid of something so dumb?\u201d Xie Qing King was shocked.\n\n\u201cDumb? You better hope she doesn\u2019t find us. She can kill you as easily as she might a chicken.\u201d Old Cat looked at him with disdain.\n\n\u201cStop it, you two. She\u2019s coming,\u201d Han Sen said, looking at Lady Snake.\n\nLady Snake could neither see nor hear, but she was sure Han Sen was around there. It kept searching and searching, leaving him unable to move.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do? She will bump into us sooner or later. And when that happens, we\u2019ll have no choice but to move,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t hear and she can\u2019t see. Why don\u2019t we just get rid of her when she comes too close?\u201d Xie Qing King said.\n\nOld Cat laughed and said, \u201cNo one is stopping you from trying. If you want to die, be my guest; I will be running.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we escape?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nOld Cat laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But judging from the way she\u2019s searching, she\u2019ll be bumping into you first. And when she\u2019s busy with you two, I can have a chance to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re f*cking shameless.\u201d Han Sen shot him a glare. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea, but even so, you cannot leave here completely. She will hunt you down, one way or another. If we are all going to die, why don\u2019t we work together, find her weakness, and kill her through co-operation?\u201d\n\nOld Cat said, \u201cNo. We cannot fight her. I am old, and I still want to live a while longer. I will run first, anyway. There\u2019s nothing you can do about that. Look around you, man. Don\u2019t you think this place looks a little different? Maybe her rising made the restrictions disappear. Perhaps we can waltz out now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. If you want to run off, why don\u2019t you tell us what it is?\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nOld Cat looked at Lady Snake, and then said, \u201cIf I\u2019m correct, this thing is a new creature. One combined with a Naga. She has the power of a Naga, and she\u2019s got the creature\u2019s genes. That makes her even scarier\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are their weaknesses?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI told you. Her vision and hearing are awful,\u201d Old Cat said.\n\n\u201cAnd? How do we kill her?\u201d Han Sen pressed.\n\n\u201cHaha! Nagas are a noble race, and any of them can easily destroy the tribes and families of others. Where the crystallizers found Nagas, I have no idea. But I really don\u2019t think you can kill her. It would be best if you decide which of the two of you would rather die first. Who knows? Maybe one of you can make it out while the other is mauled.\u201d Old Cat sounded quite spiteful.\n\nAfter that, Lady Snake came right before them. If she slithered in another circle, she\u2019d undoubtedly bump into them. She\u2019d hit Xie Qing King first, too, judging from her position.\n\nWhen Lady Snake was only thirty meters away from Xie Qing King, the spirit said, \u201cIf she\u2019s as strong as the cat says, I will try and fend her off while you make a break for it. Just remember to upload my comic.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wished to say something, but the monster suddenly changed direction. It was supposed to hit Xie Qing King, but now it was going for Old Cat instead.\n\n\u201cOh, sh*t!\u201d Old Cat\u2019s eyes widened."
