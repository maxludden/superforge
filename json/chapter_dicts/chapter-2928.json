    "text": "Nine Thousand King laughed and let go of Qige. He let him land next to his feet. He touched his face and laughed. \u201cGood! You are a good boy.\u201d\n\nQige quickly said, \u201cTo have a powerful father like you, I must have fulfilled a few lifetimes of good deeds to be rewarded so handsomely. I don\u2019t just have to be your child either. I can be your cow. I can be your horse. I can be your servant and slave. It would be my pleasure. I never dreamed of being able to have such an amazing, invincible father like you before.\u201d\n\nHan Sen and the Extreme King could not watch this anymore. After all, this was a child of the 10 generals. They did not expect him to behave like this.\n\nWhen Nine Thousand King heard what was said, he smiled. He squinted his eyes and placed his hand on Qige\u2019s head. He looked at Moon Shadow God with a cocky expression. \u201cMoon Shadow, now that your son has agreed, you should be fine with this too.\u201d\n\nMoon Shadow God was furious. She also knew that regardless of how much Qige begged, if she did not agree, Nine Thousand King would crush Qige\u2019s head.\n\nNo matter how much she did not want to, Qige was still her son. She didn\u2019t have an option to say no. She did not want to see her son die in front of her.\n\nWhile Nine Thousand King, Moon Shadow God, and her son were entangled with their own matters, Han Sen went over to Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and asked, \u201cWho is this Nine Thousand King? I have never heard of someone like that in Sacred before.\u201d\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster did not immediately say anything. A voice soon sounded in Han Sen\u2019s ear. \u201cAlthough Nine Thousand King was not one of the top 10 generals, he was an officer of Sacred. Although he was not as famous as the 10 generals, he is not someone ordinary. After Sacred was destroyed, people assumed he was dead. I did not expect to find him alive. While the big barren power was the weakest, he came to the Sacred ruins. It looks like he wants that thing from Sacred.\u201d\n\nHan Sen nodded. He knew many scary people were going to the ruins, so this could not have been a coincidence.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. Besides, he did not know much about the topic. It was just a coincidence that he was there. The more he spoke, the more wrong he was. He preferred not to say anything.\n\n\u201cMoon Shadow, have you thought about it? There is not much time, so stop delaying your son\u2019s business.\u201d Nine Thousand King looked evil as he patted Qige on the head.\n\nMoon Shadow God replied, \u201cNine Thousand King, let go of my son. If you do, I will let you do anything.\u201d Although she really wanted to kill him, she had to think about her son with Evil Sky Dog. He was the only connection they had now, and she did not want to see it severed.\n\n\u201cHa! Ha!\u201d Nine Thousand Kind looked at the sky and laughed. \u201cMoon Shadow, do not worry. Why would I do anything bad to our son? He is such a good son. I will be happy to accept him. I will reward him and not hurt him.\u201d\n\nQige was very happy. He kowtowed as he shared his gratitude. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d\n\nNine Thousand King was still acting cocky. He patted Qige on the head and smiled. \u201cGood, son! Very good, son! I really should reward you.\u201d\n\nQige rolled his eyes. He stared at Han Sen and said, \u201cTo be your son is the greatest reward. I would not dare try and take your rewards, but that crystallizer slave dared to disrespect you. He deserves to die. I am not strong enough to fight him. Otherwise, I would skin him alive in the name of avenging you. As for the Dog Crow Bow, I want to retrieve it so I can give it to you. It will be a gift for the gratitude I feel for you.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. They thought that guy was the ultimate rare thing. He was like an extreme animal. Even now, he still wanted to bite Han Sen.\n\n\u201cGood, son, that is not so hard.\u201d Nine Thousand King looked at Han Sen and quietly asked, \u201cDid you hear him? Give the Dog Crow Bow back to my son.\u201d\n\nQige shouted, \u201cDad, stop talking crap with him. Just kill him!\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Qige. He raised the Dog Crow Bow again and coldly said, \u201cI said the life of my prey is decided by me.\u201d\n\nThe bow was being pointed at Qige. He was shocked, but he saw that Nine Thousand King was right next to him. He had the courage again to mock Han Sen. \u201cHow dare you to misbehave before my father. You have a death wish!\u201d\n\nHan Sen ignored him. He thought Qige was a mad dog and stupid. Nine Thousand King must have been worried about something. Otherwise, he would have already attacked. There should have been no need for simple provocation.\n\nEven Nine Thousand King did not dare do anything. He was a fox trying to prove that he was a tiger.\n\nBuzz!\n\nHan Sen let an arrow loose. The teeth arrow was gone. It was clearly going for Qige. Qige\u2019s expression changed, but it quickly returned to normal. He saw Nine Thousand King raise his hand again. He thought Nine Thousand King would catch the teeth arrow just like before.\n\nSuddenly, the teeth arrow pierced through Qige\u2019s head and came out the other side.\n\nQige\u2019s eyes were wide open. He could not believe he was about to die like that.\n\n\u201cTime power!\u201d Nine Thousand King\u2019s expression changed too. His hand only reached out a short distance, so he was unable to catch the arrow.\n\nMoon Shadow God looked shocked and very conflicted. She ran to hold Qige\u2019s dead body. She gnashed her teeth, looked at Han Sen, and screamed, \u201cI will kill you!\u201d\n\nAfter that, she turned into a shadow. She blended in with the darkness and disappeared.\n\nNine Thousand King steadily stared at Han Sen. His power seemed red. He was suppressing Han Sen, who was just standing there. He looked like he was going to kill Han Sen any second, but he had yet to do anything.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster asked, \u201cIf you guys fight here before entering Sacred, are you not going to benefit other people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will let you live a bit longer.\u201d Nine Thousand King coldly grunted. He turned around and fled through the door. He vanished into the darkness.\n\nAncient Abyss Grandmaster turned to Han Sen and said, \u201cBrother Han, you really should not have killed Qige. Now, we have offended two scary elites at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat mad dog was worse than an animal. He bit whoever he saw. It was better to just kill him.\u201d Han Sen did not care. He planned on going to Sacred to save Littleflower. Even if Sacred\u2019s 10 generals or four holy beasts were there, they would not stop him. Besides, Qige was just a dog hybrid with a bark worse than his bite.\n\n\u201cRight, never mind then. Let\u2019s go to Sacred. Otherwise, they will have the chance first.\u201d Ancient Abyss Grandmaster paused. He smiled at Han Sen. \u201cIf you do not mind, why don\u2019t you come with me? Then, we will all have backup.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind our presence, of course, we will come.\u201d Han Sen called Bao\u2019er, who was riding atop the big goldfish. They followed Ancient Abyss Grandmaster through the door.\n\nAs for Qige\u2019s dead body, Han Sen did not bother looking at it. There was only a killing announcement in his head and no mention of beast souls. There wasn\u2019t even a xenogeneic gene. Qige was obviously useless rubbish."
