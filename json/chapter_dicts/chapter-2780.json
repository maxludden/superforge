    "text": "The group of elites had all reached the Space Garden via the Flower God\u2019s battleship. They weren\u2019t aware of the route they took to get there or even how they had made it through the border of the xenogeneic space. Because of that, they still didn\u2019t know if entry to the Space Garden required some special password or technique. So, even if they took down the Space Garden now, there was no point in doing so if they wouldn\u2019t be able to find or enter it again. As a result, no one tried anything suspicious or hostile.\n\nBased on what Violet had said, it seemed that something special was required to enter the Space Garden. And that made everyone think.\n\nThis was obviously a very difficult and vulnerable moment for the Flower Gods. But if Violet had dared to bring them all here anyway, then that had to mean he had contingencies in place. He couldn\u2019t simply be carrying a special item on his person that would allow them to access the Space Garden at a later date.\n\nAll the deified elites were looking at the half-buried Flower Gods, and as they did, Han Sen was also thinking. Then, he leapt into the air and flew up into the sky. He wanted to look down on the Space Garden from above and see what it looked like from a bird\u2019s eye view.\n\nBut as Han Sen flew, he noticed a shadow flying alongside him. Someone else had obviously had the same thought.\n\nThat shadow noticed Han Sen, too. They glanced at each other, and Han Sen realized it was the little girl that had been following Bai Wanjie. They had met briefly in the battleship\u2019s canteen.\n\nThe girl didn\u2019t look any older than Bai Wanjie, but the crown prince seemed to respect her a great deal, judging from the way that he treated her. Han Sen couldn\u2019t correctly guess her identity.\n\nThe Bai family had many princes and princesses, and Han Sen had never been able to meet them all. And there were many other members of the royal family, as well. Not to mention that Han Sen had seen only a few of the Extreme King superiors.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing up here?\u201d the girl asked with a lift of her lips.\n\n\u201cI am admiring the view,\u201d Han Sen replied with a smile.\n\n\u201cHmph. You are weird.\u201d The girl turned away from Han Sen and continued flying high.\n\nHan Sen knew how to teleport, but if he used it openly, some of the elites might recognize it as God\u2019s Wander. He didn\u2019t want other people to see it, so he didn\u2019t use it there.\n\nThe Space Garden was only the size of a planet, but that didn\u2019t affect its rare and unique properties. When Han Sen flew high enough to see the whole of the Space Garden, he was stunned to discover that the entire place was like a giant ganoderma lucidum mushroom with many layers. The flower fields were like steps, and they were all a part of that mushroom. It was put together with an amazing level of detail and complexity.\n\nNow, Han Sen was able to confirm his guess. The Space Garden could very well be alive. Maybe it was a very high-level planet xenogeneic.\n\nGrowing plants on a plant xenogeneic seemed quite unbelievable, now that he really considered the idea. But Han Sen had seen all the beings that lived within the Black Hole Spider before. This was certainly possible.\n\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d the Extreme King girl asked, flying over next to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cI see a big mushroom.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\n\u201cHmph. You were boasting about your strength when we were on the battleship, and yet, you cannot see anything.\u201d The girl lifted her lips.\n\n\u201cSo, do you see what\u2019s actually going on?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The little girl looked quite cocky. She patted herself on the chest.\n\n\u201cYou are too young to see anything.\u201d Han Sen pretended not to believe her.\n\nThe girl shot him an arch look, and she said, \u201cBeing older doesn\u2019t mean someone is better. Just like you. You have eyes, but you are still blind. You cannot see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell me what you see,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nFull of confidence, the girl said, \u201cOf course. If I see it correctly, the Space Garden itself is a giant plant. It is a very high-level xenogeneic. It could even be true god class. But its lifeforce is so weak, it looks as if it is going to die soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cViolet said that when the Flower Gods made geno fluids a long time ago, they used a special material that was native to this region. I didn\u2019t believe it back then, but I sure am starting to now. If this is a true god class xenogeneic plant, the xenogeneic plants that grow inside it will adopt its elements. Even an ordinary species that develops here will become different from those on the outside.\u201d The girl really did seem to know her stuff. Just like Han Sen, she seemed to think the Space Garden was one large xenogeneic plant.\n\nHan Sen looked at the little girl with shock, and he thought to himself, \u201cThe Extreme King really are different. With their knowledge and their power, they really are much better than smaller races.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think the Space Garden is a true god plant, then what do you make of all the Flower Gods that are buried in the field?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nThe girl really liked how amazed Han Sen was, and she answered, \u201cThat is difficult to judge. It could be that the xenogeneic plant knows it is dying, and thus, it is trying to collect more energy to keep itself alive. Either that, or the Flower Gods themselves signed a contract with the xenogeneic plant. Right now, the xenogeneic plant is going to die, so the Flower Gods must die with it. There are many possibilities, but until we learn more, it will be difficult to tell which explanation is correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, how do we find out the truth?\u201d Han Sen was truly flabbergasted this time. The Extreme King had many resources, but such powerful materials still took time to absorb. This girl was so young, and so, he was surprised that she had so much knowledge.\n\nThe girl thought for a moment and said, \u201cThe only way to learn more is to dig up the Flower God people. And then, if we fully examine their bodies, we are bound to learn a clue or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is easier said than done. Didn\u2019t you see the power of those deified elites? Even they could not dig up the soil in that garden.\u201d Han Sen lifted his lips. He had been infected by the girl\u2019s mannerisms, it seemed. He had already adopted her gestures.\n\nThe girl glanced at the field with disdain. \u201cYou underestimate the deified elites. I don\u2019t know about any others, but I know for sure that Bai Wanjie is not that useless. If he thinks hard enough, he\u2019ll find a way to excavate the Flower Gods. The only thing that matters, following that, is the fact that whoever we excavate will probably die. With my knowledge of him, I think he is going to strike gold real soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Bai Wanjie your senior?\u201d Han Sen asked when he noticed that the girl wasn\u2019t using an honorific when she referred to Bai Wanjie. This weirded him out, and so he felt compelled to ask.\n\n\u201cWho told you Bai Wanjie was my senior? That is backward. I am his senior,\u201d the girl said while looking at Han Sen angrily.\n\nHan Sen wanted to say something, but he saw Bai Wanjie do something just like the girl had predicted. He started to do something special.\n\nAs Han Sen watched, the man selected an average member of the Flower Gods. And then, out of nowhere, Bai Wanjie pulled out a wine cup. He covered the Flower God member with it, and then pulled him up.\n\nThe Flower God had been motionless and almost completely buried in the soil, but now Bai Wanjie was pulling him up little by little. His head and his neck were showing. Furthermore, the Flower God\u2019s body didn\u2019t seem to be injured by the pull. He looked fine.\n\nBai Wanjie kept on pulling. Soon after, the Flower God\u2019s feet popped out of the soil. Many people turned to look at him.\n\nWhile everyone turned to observe the excavated Flower God, the Flower God opened his eyes. The flower on his head opened, and it exploded with a powerful substance chain. The creature jumped furiously at Bai Wanjie, who was the closest.\n\n\u201cWeird\u2026 I thought the Flower Gods didn\u2019t have deified elites.\u201d Han Sen was shocked. That Flower God had substance chain powers that only a deified should have possessed."
