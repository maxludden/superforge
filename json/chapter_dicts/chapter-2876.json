Now, he has selected to challenge Dollar at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the grudge that must exist between Golden Growler and Dollar? Golden Growlers has first place, yet he still wants to challenge Dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Dollar concedes in the match, he can achieve first place, right?\u201d.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t an elite have the dignity not to do that? Dollar won\u2019t just give up before at least trying to fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is hard to tell. Didn\u2019t Demon Alpha concede directly to become third place?\u201d\n\nPeople were so excited. They were talking ravenously amongst each other. They were shocked that Golden Growler was doing this challenge.\n\nGolden Growler appeared on the space battleground. He stood atop a planet. It looked like he was quietly waiting for the fight to begin.\n\nPeople tried to guess and see if Dollar was willing to accept and join the fight or just concede and reach first place. Suddenly, a shadow entered the space battleground. It was Dollar.\n\n\u201cHe has accepted the fight. He really accepted the fight. The challenge time is over. This will be the final fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough Dollar is strong and has that god personality armament, I think Golden Growler is stronger.\u201d \u201cI think so too. After all, Dollar is just butterfly class.\u201d\n\n\u201cGolden Growler easily managed to scare off Very High Leader. Even Very High Leader said no creature in the universe can defeat Golden Growler, and I think he is right.\u201d\n\nThe Thousand Treasury was streaming this. They were saying similar things.\n\nAlthough what happened inside the geno god list could not be streamed or recorded, ordinary creatures did not understand high-level deifieds. Sometimes they did not understand the fights between deified elites. This, the Thousand Treasury used words to describe things. There were two Thousand Treasury deifieds explaining the fights and history of deified elite battlers.\n\nOf course, the Thousand Treasury capitalized on it all by establishing a gambling station. The two speakers would talk about who would win and who would lose.\n\n\u201cGolden Growler used his first rank identity to challenge Dollar,\u201d a deified explained. \u201cThat is surprising. Judging from what we have seen, Dollar might stand a lower chance against him. If Golden Growler wins this fight, he will lose his first place. It is hard to predict what the result might look like.\u201d Another deified explained things too. He said, \u201cDollar accepted the fight. No matter who wins or who loses, this will be the most exciting match out of all the geno god list fights.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Let\u2019s not talk about their grudges. It is very hard to predict who will end up in first place. If you are interested, you can come put a bet down with the Thousand Treasury\u2019s gambling station. The window for putting down your bets will be closing any second now. So, do not miss this final call, people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that being said, it all comes down to power. Golden Growler should be able to beat Dollar.\u201d\n\nWith many races of the universe watching, Han Sen landed on Golden Growler\u2019s planet. A man and a beast looked at each other on a grass field full of yellow sand.\n\n\u201cVery exciting,\u201d the commentator excitedly said. \u201cTwo scary deifieds are staring at each other. They are going to launch the scariest attacks ever. Golden Growler is strong, but Dollar is not weak. He is mysterious. His amazing geno arts and the geno god armaments he wields are quite shocking. It will be hard to tell which one of them wins. The fight is going to begin.\u201d After the commentator\u2019s speech, Golden Growler and Han Sen became two invincible elites. They were fighting each other with power. Whenever they moved their hands, it was time to determine the winner.\n\nAnother commentator tried his hardest to explain the situation. \u201cPeople, please do not think they are only staring at each other. In fact, a silent will-fight has begun. If one of their fates has a flaw, they will receive a deadly attack.\u201d\n\nThe two commentators were deified, but they were only primitive. Their talents had been decided only through geno fluids. Their power was fairly regular. Their main job was to earn money for the Thousand Treasury. Of course, even now, that was their ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cGolden Growler moved. He is running at Dollar. He is not going quickly, but every step of his had the power to step on stars. They are like the footsteps that not even the sky nor gods can stop. God, it looks like the whole of space is moving with him. How scary is this attack?\u201d The commentator was trying to hype it up.\n\nWith all the creatures hearing the commentator, they could see Golden Growler running at Dollar. They grew nervous. They were not sure what sort of attack Golden Growler was going to unleash. It could be one hit that killed Dollar.\n\n\u201cVery fast\u2026 Even faster\u2026 Even faster again\u2026 It feels like I can see ripples in space. It is no wonder Golden Growler is an invincible elite that Very High Leader could not even go against. He gathers up power to the highest level that won\u2019t leak. He seems very light. When he strikes, the sky will break, and the ground will crack. Everyone, please be prepared. Do not get shocked by Golden Growler\u2019s power later and have it affect your will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Golden Growler jumped. It seems normal, but the trail of his body is so good that you cannot imagine it. It has blocked every way Dollar can go. Dollar cannot fall back. Of course\u2026 Dollar is standing there not moving. With Golden Growler\u2019s perfect attack, he cannot retreat. Maybe the space around Dollar is sealed up. He cannot move. Will he be eaten by Golden Growler? We forgot a question. If Dollar is eaten by Golden Growler and will no longer exist, who will obtain first place? Would it still be Golden Growler?\u201d The commentator stood up with excitement.\n\nThe other commentator started screaming, \u201cHe moved! Dollar finally moved. He has put out his hands. They are so straight yet so crooked. One is up and one is down. It has the most mysterious knowledge of the universe that cannot be imagined. It has reached a level of Return to Origin. We underestimated Dollar. He is the top class in the universe. This attack is going to be the first\u2026\u201d Everyone in the universe felt their eyes open wide. They were seeing the scariest xenogeneic and the most mysterious xenogeneic in the geno god list get together. They were nervous.\n\nEvery creature was guessing who would win when they met up. \u201cSo close\u2026 So close\u2026 The strongest hit\u2026 The scariest hit\u2026 They finally\u2026\u201d The commentator was excitedly shouted. His entire body was in an orgasmic mode.\n\nEvery creature in the universe was excited by his speech. Suddenly, the very excited commentator stopped talking.\n\nThe two commentators were petrified. It was like they were no longer able to speak.\n\nIt was not just them. Every being in the universe watching this fight suddenly froze. They saw what happened on the space battleground, and it had made their mouths turn into an 0-shape.\n\nThey saw Golden Growler touch Han Sen\u2019s body. His claws went on Dollar\u2019s shoulders, but he did not open his mouth to eat Dollar. He used his head to rub Dollar\u2019s cheek like a house cat.\n\nDollar was holding Golden Growler. He stroked his head. He looked like he was playing with his own pet."
