    "text": "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Han Sen looked at the Baron expressionlessly.\n\nSeeing how many people had gathered, the Baron let go of the woman\u2019s arms. He stood up, smiled, and said, \u201cMaster, I just want to have some fun with this slave. I have been here for a few days, and I think I\u2019m going to get sick if I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet on your knees and apologize. Beg for her forgiveness.\u201d Han Sen looked at him without emotion.\n\nThe Baron didn\u2019t do anything. He just laughed it off. \u201cMaster, she is just a cheap civilian. Things don\u2019t have to be like that.\u201d\n\nThere were many people gathering. There were mothers, kids, other Barons, and Viscounts. They all turned to look at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cHow is he going to deal with that Baron? If he punishes him, it\u2019ll scare off many of the other Barons. If the Barons are expected to lay down their lives for Han Sen on this planet, and they aren\u2019t even allowed to touch a woman, I doubt many will want to hang around. But at the same time, if he doesn\u2019t punish him, his reputation and standing will most certainly be lowered. This is a bad situation, no matter which way you look at it.\u201d Inside the room, a Viscount looked at Han Sen and the Baron, measuring it all. He looked interested in what would happen.\n\nOther people were waiting to hear Han Sen\u2019s solution to this problem. With a situation like this on his hands, his way of solving it would tell them a lot about the sort of person he was.\n\nThe men and women were conflicted. They were very scared about what was going on, and they were afraid they\u2019d all end up like the mother. They didn\u2019t think they could protect themselves, and neither could they protect their kids.\n\nNow, all they could do was rely on Han Sen. If Han Sen let this Baron go, then that would put them in a very bad situation.\n\nHan Sen looked at the Baron and did not say anything. He pulled out Ghost Teeth Knife. Killing a Baron would not require this knife, but this situation was more complicated than it seemed. And so, Han Sen held it.\n\nHan Sen had gotten it back from Yisha a few days ago. So, this was his first time drawing it out.\n\n\u201cI can give you one chance. Use your power to block my strike. If you do, I will pretend nothing happened.\u201d Han Sen looked coldly at the Baron.\n\nThe Baron looked shocked, and he said, \u201cMaster! It is just a commoner woman. If you want, I can give you a hundred extra.\u201d\n\nHan Sen smiled, holding his knife. He approached him. Without emotion, he responded by saying, \u201cIt does not matter how many there are. They are my property and no one touches my stuff without my explicit permission. I will kill whoever does. I gave you the opportunity to live, but you brushed it off. Now, I am giving you a second chance. Again, block my strike, and you can go free. You will become the first one who has ever touched something of mine and lived to tell the tale.\u201d\n\nSeeing Han Sen approach, they all noted how angry and murderous he looked. So, the man summoned his geno armament. It was a shield.\n\nThe Baron was thinking, \u201cYou are just a Baron, too. You can\u2019t use the power that weapon possesses. You might be stronger than me, but do you really think I cannot block a single one of your attacks?\u201d\n\nMany of the other Barons and Viscounts thought Han Sen was being rather cruel. But at the same time, he was giving the man a chance to live.\n\nThey were both Baron class, and that man had a shield geno armament. If Han Sen sought to kill him, it\u2019d be very difficult to do so in a single hit.\n\n\u201cIf Master insists, I will just block a strike then,\u201d the Baron shouted, propping up the shield in front of him.\n\nHan Sen was in front of that Baron now, and he looked at him coldly. Han Sen swung his blade. Because Han Sen was not a Viscount, the Ghost Teeth Knife did not possess an aura. This was to be a raw, plain hit.\n\nThe Baron roared and used his shield.\n\nKatcha!\n\nGhost Teeth Knife broke through the shield as if it was cutting up a plank of tofu. The Baron fell back. His geno armament had broken, and he coughed up a vat of blood.\n\nHe didn\u2019t look too injured. It was just the tip of his forehead that had been cut. There was a red dot there.\n\n\u201cThank you for sparing my life.\u201d The Baron bowed before Han Sen and looked cocky.\n\nMany of the Barons and Viscounts looked on in disdain, telling themselves, \u201cHe really needs us to develop this planet. I knew he couldn\u2019t kill a Baron like that. It was all just for show.\u201d\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. He just put the knife back and stared at the Baron.\n\nThe Baron tried wiping the blood from his brow, but he couldn\u2019t clear it. His wound kept bleeding, and the look on his face slowly changed.\n\nQuickly, the wound spread from his forehead. His skin began to crack and split on his forehead like a spiderweb. It spread down to his neck, and from there, it ravaged the rest of his body. The wounds were cracks that slowly separated, exposing his fat and muscle.\n\n\u201cAargh!\u201d The Baron fell to the ground, screaming in agony. The feeling of his skin being slowly tom apart was worse than anything a single cut could deliver.\n\n\u201cPlease forgive me!\u201d The Baron was screaming and squealing, trying to beg for his life. The pain overtook his vocal cords, distorting his words.\n\n\u201cI gave you a chance,\u201d Han Sen said quietly. He did not even blink, and then he returned to his chamber.\n\nThis was not a night one could easily sleep through. The skin of the Baron was ripping itself to shreds. Chunks of flesh fell off, bit-by-bit, with the man calling out for aid all night. He only stopped breathing when the next morning rolled\n\nWhen others went to see him, the flesh was spread everywhere. All that was left were his bones. The skeleton was still breaking apart, though. The bones were cracking, and a few days later, they were nothing but firm bits on the ground.\n\nEveryone was scared. Dying like that was a far worse fate than a simple, quick death.\n\n\u201cNice kill,\u201d Gu Qingcheng said. If she had been the one to kill him, his fate would have been even worse.\n\nAfter that, the Barons and Viscounts were all scared. The mothers and the kids really appreciated what Han Sen had done. But they now understood that their lives were entirely dependent on Han Sen. If Han Sen objected to them being played with, no one could do anything to hurt them.\n\nBut if Han Sen wanted them dead, they wouldn\u2019t be living. They\u2019d be killed pretty badly."
