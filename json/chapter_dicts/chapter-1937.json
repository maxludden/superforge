    "text": "Han Sen walked around a bit, but he didn\u2019t catch sight of God\u2019s Retribution again.\n\n\u201cMaybe my eyes are going funny.\u201d Han Sen shook his head, then went to find a place in the Buddha city to stay.\n\nThe city was made of gold, and even the ground was paved with it. It was rather intimidating in its splendor. There were statues of the Buddha everywhere, and their presence made Han Sen feel uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI wonder when Yisha will show up again?\u201d Han Sen waited for another two days, and still didn\u2019t see her. He was getting impatient now.\n\nPeople in the city were starting to talk about Burning Lamp Alpha\u2019s upcoming speech quite a bit now. No race was prohibited from hearing the speech, and anyone of any status could go.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder she said it does not matter if I hear it or not. Since the speech will address everyone, surely nothing unique or valuable will be said. Everyone will know whatever he says,\u201d Han Sen was thinking as he approached a Buddha statue.\n\nHe was walking on a famous Buddha Path. It was a straight road that led straight to the Burning Lamp Alpha\u2019s palace. The way was ten meters wide, adorned with three thousand gold Buddhas fencing it.\n\nThe rumors said that every Buddha represented a world. Three thousand Buddhas meant there were three thousand worlds. There was a geno art of the Buddha that was called Three Thousand Worlds. It was derived from the three thousand Buddhas of that path.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe the stories, though. But he had nothing better to do with his time, and so he decided to come and take a look. Perhaps he\u2019d be able to learn a thing or two.\n\nBecause Burning Lamp Alpha would give a speech, many outsiders were there, just like Han Sen. They were all accompanied by Magic of their own.\n\nBubble began bouncing up and down, wild with excitement.\n\nThe intelligence of the Magic grew slowly, and their personalities were rather simple. They weren\u2019t complex beings. Reaching the level of intelligence of the one that mimicked the shape of Yisha would take a few decades. It also took a lot of energy for that to happen.\n\nThe three thousand Buddha statues were all unique, and not one of them was a copy of another. Han Sen came to take a look to kill some time.\n\nWhen he walked past two hundred Buddhas, he saw Speechless and a few of the other outsiders there. None of them appeared to be low-ranked. Speechless had probably guided them there so they could take a look at the Buddhas.\n\nHan Sen took a closer look and was surprised. All those outsiders were of a different race. One of them was a Feather.\n\nThe Feathers had been removed from the hall of higher races, and they were hardly ever seen outside of Holy Heaven nowadays. It was nothing small to see a Feather here.\n\nHan Sen did not recognize that Feather, though. But amongst them was one person that Han Sen knew. And that was Hai\u2019er of Pirate. She, too, was in the Buddha city.\n\n\u201cIt looks like everyone is taking this heaven business seriously. I wonder what\u2019s so good about it, and what resides in their heaven? I don\u2019t know what Yisha was thinking when she decided not to explain anything. Am I not her student?\n\nOr did she just get kicked in the head by a donkey?\u201d Han Sen felt depressed.\n\nLuckily, Hai\u2019er would only recognize Han Sen if he was wearing his Dongxuan armor. That would be the face of Dollar. If she knew who he was, she might very well have tried to attack him then and there.\n\nAside from Han Sen, there was also a man with a cow\u2019s head. He looked like a minotaur. He was not of the Kao, but Han Sen thought he was the same race as the fellow he had encountered during various Rebate events.\n\nThere were three others there, too. One of them had a head that grew like a dragonfly. There was one with three faces and six arms, and the other was a Gana man. He had the snake lower body and all.\n\nThey were all unique. Han Sen could not tell how strong they all were, but they all looked very different.\n\nHan Sen stopped looking at them and returned his gaze to the statues around him. Han Sen really didn\u2019t want to see Hai\u2019er, in case she somehow identified him.\n\n\u201cBuddha Lady, on this trip to heaven, how many people can reach the other side?\u201d The Gana man addressed Speechless.\n\n\u201cThere are many geniuses here, so many should be able to reach the other side. You are each an elite of your respective races, with unique talents. If you have a strong will, you will make it,\u201d Speechless said.\n\nThe cowhead man grunted and said, \u201cMaybe not. This heaven has opened many times, and fewer than ten finish it each time. I am sure there is some limit to the number of those who can make it. And the more elites there are, the harder it will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmitabha!\u201d Speechless spoke the Buddha catchphrase, and then she said, \u201cSig Earl, you think too much. There are no enforced limitations. If you can walk through heaven, you will.\u201d\n\nThe Gana man emotionlessly looked at the cowhead man and said, \u201cSig, if you are so afraid, you do not have to go.\u201d \u201cGoode, what are you saying?\u201d The cowhead man ran towards the Gana in rage, breathing fire out of his nose.\n\n\u201cCalm down. This is the Buddha\u2019s Path; you cannot make so much noise here.\u201d Speechless stepped between the two.\n\nHai\u2019er and the guy with three faces and six arms did not speak. They were merely watching.\n\nSig and Goode did not look as if they would continue the feud, and they simply ignored each other after that.\n\nSpeechless kept guiding them forward, showing off the three thousand Buddhas. When they came near Han Sen, Han Sen turned away from them. He didn\u2019t want to get involved.\n\nShe only saw his back, but Speechless recognized Han Sen. Her expression became strange, and she pretended she hadn\u2019t noticed him. She continued her tour of the three thousand Buddhas.\n\nSeeing them walk away, Han Sen felt much relief. But before he could completely relax, Hai\u2019er walked back towards Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. \u201cDid she see something?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was not afraid of her, but he couldn\u2019t risk his identity of Dollar being exposed. It\u2019d cause big trouble with Yisha.\n\nHai\u2019er walked right up to Han Sen and looked him over. Han Sen kept looking at the Buddha and ignored her.\n\nHan Sen decided that, if she did notice something, he\u2019d deny whatever she said. He\u2019d deny no matter what.\n\nHai\u2019er put her hand on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder and spoke quietly into his ear. She said, \u201cAre you romantically involved with Speechless?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He certainly hadn\u2019t expected Hai\u2019er to say that. So, he just looked at her and pretended he didn\u2019t know what she meant."
