Giant wings spread from the bull monster\u2019s back and its body was covered in blue scales, but the creature stared at Han Sen with childlike intensity.\n\nHan Sen had heard him repeat those three words several times while they gambled. Han Sen had won seven times. By now, the bull monster\u2019s eyes looked as if they were going to burst into flames. Han Sen was worried that the beast might attack him out of frustration.\n\n\u201cHow about you shake the coin, and I will guess?\u201d Han Sen suggested, setting the coin down in front of the monster.\n\nWhen the bull monster heard him say this, his bull eyes brightened. He reached out a massive hand, using a power to pull the coin up into his coarse palms.\n\n\u201cYou will do the guessing. We are still betting for that shield on your back and the deified geno cores that I lost. You will have to give them back,\u201d the bull monster said to Han Sen while holding that coin.\n\n\u201cSure. I\u2019m willing to bet it all.\u201d Han Sen blinked and went on to ask, \u201cBrother Bull, what are you going to bet?\u201d\n\nThe bull monster hesitated. It only had seven geno cores, and they had all been lost to Han Sen. It had nothing more to gamble with.\n\nThere were many elite and powerful xenogeneics scattered throughout the universe, but few of them would think of hiding something on purpose. They tended to be amazingly honest.\n\nThe bull monster wasn\u2019t really giving up as much as it might have seemed. It had seven geno cores, but it had only created one of them by itself. The other six had been stolen from other xenogeneics it had killed.\n\n\u201cStolen\u201d probably wasn\u2019t the right word, though. The bull monster had eaten the bodies of the xenogeneics, and when he ran across their geno cores, he thought they might prove useful. Therefore, he took them. And now, on this day, he had used them for gambling.\n\nHan Sen noticed that the bull monster wasn\u2019t speaking. He suspected that it had nothing left to use as a wager. He was worried that the bull monster might get upset if it really had nothing left to offer. He quickly said, \u201cHow about this, Brother Bull? You\u2019re smart and powerful enough to beat all the deifieds you come across. You could probably gather ten shields and 100 geno cores without much difficulty, if you wanted to. How about you do a favor for me as a bet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat favor would that be?\u201d The bull monster was honest, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He looked slightly warily at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cActually, the favor wouldn\u2019t really be helping me. I feel bad for you, Brother Bull. It was that godd*mn *sshole that summoned you. He didn\u2019t bring you a sacrifice. He was just playing you. If I see him again, I will try to punish him on your behalf. But I\u2019m so weak\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I can fight him. It would be very embarrassing if I had to ask you to fight him on my behalf,\u201d Han Sen confessed, looking at the bull with embarrassment.\n\nWhen the bull monster heard this, he thought Han Sen was a very nice person. He actually wanted to help him. He looked at Han Sen and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it is settled. If I lose, you can have the shield and your geno cores back. And if you lose, when I find that guy again, I will ask you to help me out with him. And you will help me, then and there,\u201d Han Sen explained, carefully confirming their arrangement.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the bull monster said with a nod. Then, he proceeded to shake the coin.\n\nHan Sen watched the way the bull monster shook the coin. He knew that the creature wasn\u2019t very good at gambling.\n\nAfter shaking it for a while, the bull monster held his hand out in front of Han Sen. With an awkward look, he said, \u201cYou can guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Bull, do you know if it is the image or the number?\u201d Han Sen asked with a smile.\n\n\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d The bull monster tried to think. He opened his hand and glanced at the coin. Then, with a confident look, he said, \u201cOf course I know what it is. Hurry up and guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Han Sen drew his voice out deliberately. He watched the bull monster\u2019s face. The bull monster looked very nervous, and then he went on to say, \u201cIt is the image.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen said that, the bull monster\u2019s face collapsed.\n\n\u201cDo it again.\u201d The bull monster gnashed its teeth and started shaking the coin.\n\n\u201cDo it again\u2026 Do it again\u2026 Do it again\u2026\u201d\n\nAn angry roar echoed through the sky, scarier than the thunder. Han Sen couldn\u2019t even remember how many times he had won by this point. The bull monster probably owed him hundreds of favors by now.\n\nBut Han Sen had to acknowledge that the bull monster was honest. Although it had lost time and time again, it had never tried to kill Han Sen in its rage.\n\nSuddenly, the storm above them lessened and grew visibly weaker. The rage left the bull monster\u2019s face, and it shouted, \u201cOh no! The God Spirit Storm is going to end. That means I have to go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you have to go back when the storm recedes?\u201d Han Sen asked with confusion.\n\nMost people knew that the xenogeneics in the god area followed the storms. They came when the storms came, and they vanished when the storms did. But no one seemed to know why creatures could only come and go with the storm.\n\nThe bull monster didn\u2019t answer Han Sen. It hesitated for a bit, then it pulled a purple scale and tossed it to Han Sen. \u201cUse this scale if you ever need help. Putting your power into it will trigger it. I will follow the signal to come and find you.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the bull monster looked at Han Sen\u2019s new heap of geno cores. Then, it turned around and prepared to leave with the fading storm.\n\n\u201cBrother Bull, hang on a sec.\u201d Han Sen stopped the bull monster.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d the bull monster said, staring balefully at him.\n\nHan Sen grabbed one of the geno cores out of the seven he had received. He threw it to the bull monster and said, \u201cIt is fate that you and I were able to meet today. I don\u2019t have anything good to offer you, so you should keep this.\u201d\n\nThe bull monster received the geno core with genuine glee. That geno core was the one the creature had created itself, and it was also the one that the bull monster had been looking at wistfully as it turned to leave.\n\nThe other geno cores were of various elements, so they wouldn\u2019t help the bull monster much. But the geno core that the bull monster had created was very precious to him.\n\n\u201cYou really are so very kind.\u201d The bull monster was very touched by this gesture. He had wanted to steal Han Sen\u2019s things, but instead of holding a grudge, Han Sen was actually trying to help him. The entire situation made the bull monster quite emotional. He almost forgot that the geno core had originally belonged to him anyway.\n\n\u201cBrother Bull, you should leave now. When I find that guy, I will summon you so that you may teach him a lesson. I will avenge you.\u201d Han Sen waved his hand and said his goodbyes.\n\nThe bull monster was becoming even more emotional, but the thunder was almost gone. He had no more time to speak. He thought Han Sen was a very good person. If there was a chance, he would definitely help Han Sen in the future.\n\nWhen the bull monster disappeared with the thunderstorm, Han Sen let out a long sigh.\n\n\u201cThat was so close. I\u2019m fortunate that he was an honest deified xenogeneic. If he wasn\u2019t, things might have turned out far worse for me. I need to stop being so reckless. Deifieds are deifieds. I cannot underestimate a single one of them.\u201d Han Sen made up his mind. If he saw Bao Lian again, he was going to end their feud. Permanently.\n\nAfter looking down and seeing that Exquisite was still in a coma, Han Sen sent a small jolt of power into her body. It seemed to unlock something inside of her, and Exquisite woke up.\n\nWhen Exquisite woke up, she jumped up. She stared at Han Sen with wide eyes and asked, \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did I hit you? You were so exhausted that you fainted,\u201d Han Sen said with a guilty look.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Exquisite started to reply, but then she realized something was amiss. She looked at the sky overhead and froze. \u201cWhere is the God Spirit Storm?\u201d"
