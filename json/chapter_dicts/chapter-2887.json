If he had taken part, they would have been even more exhilarating.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder why he has chosen to challenge the Buddha. He really is quite strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who Han Sen is. He is God\u2019s daddy. How could he do something that he was not confident with?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nEvery Buddha looked nervous and strange. In the past, no one would have believed that Han Sen could suppress Burning Lamp, who was in the top 100 of the geno god list. The Buddha had a lot of faith in Burning Lamp, but Han Sen\u2019s knife had suddenly lobbed their pride and confidence into the abyss.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s face did not move. He used his hand like a knife. He used all of the skills from Teeth Knife. The knife air soared through the sky like fangs of a generation beast. It was like it could crush everything.\n\nThis had been hyped as a showcase for Burning Lamp\u2019s might. It turned out that Burning Lamp was going to get massacred. He was at a total disadvantage. Burning Lamp could not repel Han Sen\u2019s knife air. He kept dodging. When he could no longer do so, he used his causal karma knife to block Han Sen\u2019s knife air.\n\nThe knife air hit the causal karma knife. Burning Lamp and his knife flew away like an asteroid through space. His face turned white. His organs had been rattled quite a bit.\n\n\u201cThey are both butterfly class, but Han Sen\u2019s power far exceeds that of Burning Lamp. How did that guy do this?\u201d Extreme King\u2019s fourth uncle complimented him.\n\nSecond Uncle Bai Buyi laughed and said, \u201cHan Sen should not celebrate too soon. He is strong, but he is not stronger than the Pluto Peacock. Burning Lamp used the knife to defeat Pluto Peacock. It will be hard for Han Sen to win. He needs to deal with that knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cHan Sen said that knife was the knife blank Burning Lamp stole from him.\u201d\n\nMeng Lie asked with curiosity, \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows? The Buddha love to take the powers of others for their own use. All the geno arts the Buddha have mostly stemmed from other races. In fact, something like the Return of Origin. Ha-ha\u2026 It is hard to tell\u2026\u201d Bai Buyi laughed and stopped talking.\n\n\u201cNow, it depends on whether or not Han Sen can break the knife\u2019s causal power. If he cannot break it, then it does not matter how he tries to suppress Burning Lamp. If that knife power is triggered, Burning Lamp can make a massive comeback from his situation of losing.\u201d Meng Lie looked at Han Sen, whose eyes were on fire.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s knife hit the sky. The teeth air from the Teeth Knife was strong. It suppressed Burning Lamp and made him suffocate. It made it harder for him to block Han Sen\u2019s attack.\n\nChee!\n\nBurning Lamp\u2019s chest was delivered a knife-borne lesion wherever the knife air went past. Blood came squirting out of it.\n\nKatcha!\n\nIn the next moment, Han Sen\u2019s knife pierced Burning Lamp\u2019s left rib bones. It seemed to break his bones.\n\nHan Sen was like a scary demon. He kept slashing on Burning Lamp, whose body had more and more wounds. Those wounds burned with purple fire. They kept tearing Burning Lamp\u2019s wounds and made them hurt more and more.\n\nBefore this, no one would have thought that Han Sen would take advantage this much while Burning Lamp was forced to lose so terribly. Burning Lamp could not fight back at all.\n\nThe Buddha were all gnashing their teeth. Their hearts grew more nervous.\n\nA Buddha King shouted, \u201cMister Alpha still has the causal karma knife! Han Sen cannot beat Mister Alpha! As soon as the causal karma knife kicks in, Han Sen will lose!\u201d\n\nAnother Buddha King joined in. \u201cNot bad. Even Pluto Peacock could not block the causal karma knife. Han Sen won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201d\n\nSky Palace Leader heard what the Buddha were saying and shook his head. \u201cThe Buddha are putting all their hopes and dreams on one little treasure. Even if they managed to get rid of Han Sen, it is unlikely they can remain a higher race for much longer. Burning Lamp is old.\u201d\n\nYisha looked at Han Sen and did not speak. Han Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife was not much weaker than hers, but his was a pure Teeth Knife. It was not like Yisha\u2019s Teeth Knife, which had combined with something. It just had a ripping element.\n\nEven Yisha was not sure if she could just use Teeth Knife in a battle with Han Sen.\n\n\u201cTime goes by fast,\u201d Yisha said with a sigh. \u201cWithout even noticing it, he has grown up so much. Back then, I never thought he would become deified.\u201d\n\nSky Palace Leader laughed and said, \u201cIt is not just you. Back then, Kong Fei gave him a deified feather. Many elites of the races did not spare him a second look. No one wanted to recruit him or thought he could become deified. Fortunately, you were smart. You recruited him, and you raised him. Now, Han Sen has achieved so much. I am afraid all the others are regretting it now.\u201d\n\nA wry smile appeared on Yisha\u2019s face. She did not accept Han Sen because of his power. It was because she was making a bet with an old fortune-teller. She felt ashamed to receive such compliments from Sky Palace Leader.\n\nYisha was still very happy that Han Sen had achieved the lot he had. She had provided him a lot, so it was good to see that it had not been in vain. He had exceeded her wildest expectations.\n\n\u201cHow far can he go?\u201d Yisha wanted to know what Han Sen\u2019s limit was. She was excited to see.\n\nBuddha blood fell. The knife air was like flames. With Han Sen\u2019s Teeth Knife, Burning Lamp was heavily injured. Yet he still looked at his nemesis with eyes on fire. He was not afraid and did not panic.\n\nBurning Lamp knew he had plenty of trump cards. He still had a chance of winning.\n\nKatcha!\n\nHan Sen slashed Burning Lamp\u2019s legs. He almost cut his legs off. Burning Lamp endured the pain. His eyes became brighter.\n\n\u201cCome on! Hit me more. Make me hurt more. Every injury I sustain will be a poison reverted to you.\u201d Burning Lamp was bleeding, but his faith in victory remained.\n\n\u201cIf this keeps going, Han Sen is not going to win,\u201d Li Keer, who was in the Very High, said.\n\nExquisite looked worried. \u201cThe causal karma knife can absorb power and use it. Unless Han Sen can kill Burning Lamp with one hit, when he slashes on Burning Lamp next, Burning Lamp will have the strongest weapon to fight back with. When all that reserved power is unleashed, there is no way Han Sen can block it.\u201d\n\nAt this time, Burning Lamp felt his body reach its max. He could not endure any more knife wounds. He suddenly roared like a male lion waking up. Buddha Light exploded. The causal karma knife\u2019s Buddha Light exploded. Scary power was unleashed from the knife.\n\nIn the next second, Burning Lamp\u2019s wounds turned into water. It all came out to feed the causal karma knife. It merged with the knife. Burning Lamp\u2019s body was weird as it returned to normal. He no longer had any wounds."
