    "text": "On a planet of Narrow Moon, a Rebate mother was praying sincerely.\n\n\u201cGod of the Rebate, please allow my child to evolve a second time, despite having already generated armor. I will give everything I have for this.\u201d The mother\u2019s face looked so sad.\n\nShe was Jade Duke\u2019s wife. She had a son with Jade Duke. Both of their genes were exceptional, and their child should have absolutely become a Noble. But when her son generated a geno armor a few days ago, he did not evolve a second time. He became a commoner.\n\nEven for a Duke, it was difficult to gather items to allow a second chance to evolve. Jade Duke didn\u2019t have what was required. So, the son\u2019s mother prayed to God, hoping for a miracle. They wanted him to evolve a second time, so they would not be laughed at.\n\nYour sincerity has touched God. I can satisfy your wishes.\u201d A god with gold-clothing appeared before the lady. It smiled strangely at her.\n\nThe news of Planet Eclipse possessing a red mist spring had spread, and the reports sounded true.\n\nBut without Knife Queen\u2019s permission, no one was allowed to go to Planet Eclipse to find that spring. Despite that, the Narrow Moon factions kept pushing. Moon Wheel King gathered a few Kings together for a meeting in Full Moon. Knife Queen was present there, too.\n\n\u201cKnife, does Planet Eclipse have a red mist spring?\u201d Night River King asked. He had a child that had not evolved a second time, as well.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Knife Queen said.\n\n\u201cWhy did you not tell us sooner? We cannot allow Han Sen to lay claim to that treasure.\u201d Night River King looked very angry.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Night River King feeling this way, either. The other Kings were all peeved, too. Their children, and the people who followed them, needed the spring, too. The Kings were here to represent all those who needed it.\n\nYisha coldly looked at Night River King and said, \u201cHan Sen is my student. And don\u2019t forget that you were the one to give him Planet Eclipse, as a slight. Do you think you can just break the Narrow Moon laws to suit yourself?\u201d\n\nNight River King coughed and kept going. \u201cWe cannot break our laws, no. But Han Sen is still a suspicious individual. If we provide him this treasure and then discover he is a spy, we will suffer a grand loss. Don\u2019t you all agree?\u201d\n\nYes. We shouldn\u2019t allow an outsider to receive such a treasure,\u201d Flower King said.\n\nAside from Black-Moon King, all the other Kings shared the same opinion.\n\n\u201cKnife, we don\u2019t know how much is stored in that spring. If it isn\u2019t much, then it is fine. If it is a lot, we cannot allow a suspicious outsider to lay claim to it. Why don\u2019t we send someone to inspect how much is stored there? Then, we can fairly share the contents of the spring. We can save some for Han Sen. Does that suggestion not satisfy all our desires?\u201d Moon Wheel King said.\n\nThis time, many of the other Kings agreed. They weren\u2019t greedy about the spring. The pressure was merely coming from their family members and other bad relationships.\n\n\u201cHan Sen is my student, and Planet Eclipse is bound to him legally.\u201d Yisha spoke with an absence of emotion.\n\n\u201cKnife, why are you being so stubborn? He is just an outsider. And he is suspicious.\u201d Night River King looked glum. He went on to say, \u201cIf you absolutely insist on this stance, then we\u2019ll take it to a vote. You know what will happen after that.\u201d\n\nYisha looked at all of them and said, \u201cFine. You want the red mist spring so badly? You can bring ten members. No one above Viscount is allowed. How much they can claim will depend entirely on them. That is my bottom line on this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, deal,\u201d Night River King agreed, and the other Kings did not have an opinion.\n\nAfter Night River King returned to his planet, he rounded up the ten best Viscounts he could. He ordered them to collect as much of the red mist spring as they could.\n\n\u201cSword Know, you can stay; I wish to talk with you,\u201d Night River King said to a Viscount with a bird head and a human body.\n\nYes, My King?\u201d Sword Know\u2019s beady hawk eyes looked right at him when he spoke.\n\nNight River King gave Sword Know a box and said, \u2018You only need half a step to become Earl. This is a spirit orb that I have saved. With this orb, you should be able to become an Earl. Take it to Planet Eclipse and make yourself an Earl there. And of course, try to grab as much of the spring water as you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, My King. I will not disappoint you.\u201d Sword Know accepted the spirit orb and looked pleased. He thanked Night River King.\n\nWith his skill, he only needed a spirit orb to become an Earl. There was no chance of him failing this. This saved him years of practicing.\n\nAll the factions sent their Viscounts to Planet Eclipse. A big battleship was headed straight for Mirror Lake.\n\n\u201cNarrow Moon is still not my Narrow Moon.\u201d Inside the palace, Yisha watched the monitor with a gloomy look. She looked totally cold.\n\nHan Sen was her student, and these people were going to steal and split up his spring. It made her incredibly angry.\n\nShe had done everything she could to prevent this, but if she had stubbornly forced them to take a vote, the end result would have been far worse. No one would take her corner.\n\n\u201cDeified\u2026 I need to be deified to be the absolute queen of the Rebate!\u201d Yisha closed her eyes. The power inside her rumbled like thunder; it could have swallowed the skies.\n\nEven as strong as Yisha was, she couldn\u2019t do anything right now. She wanted more power.\n\nInside the cave in the the Red Mist Valley, the red mist was sucked into a vortex. Then, it disappeared. It went into the plants.\n\nThe three little minks were like treasures. Their bodies were glowing so much, it was difficult to look at them directly.\n\nThe centipede was moving quickly towards the plants. It extended its head, cracked open its mouth, and tried to swallow one of the minks.\n\nThe glowing mink tried to run away in terror, but its tail was attached to the plant and it could not run."
