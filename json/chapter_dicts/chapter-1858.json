    "text": "When they emerged from the mountain, it didn\u2019t seem as if anything had been affected by the events that occurred inside. The landscape was the same as it was before they entered.\n\nBack in the base, Black Steel took Captain Wood to an airship where he could heal and recover.\n\nThe people in the base had lost their marks. Han Sen asked Little Angel and Zero what things were like after he left, and he was surprised to learn that a mark had appeared on every single person in the base other than Little Angel and Zero.\n\nWith the crisis having come to an end, the day-to-day routine of the base returned to normal. It had been a rough period of time, though, and the base had been dealt quite a blow. There were only a dozen Barons remaining, and one Viscount. They would need more manpower for the future, that much was certain.\n\nHan Sen did not have the time to recruit right now, though. And at the moment, he was more concerned about how he might cook up and eat the small Sun Raven.\n\nHe tried cooking and grilling the bird, but the meat was like steel. It certainly wasn\u2019t edible in its current condition.\n\nHan Sen took the Sun Raven back to the sanctuary and nothing happened. It was still not edible, so he decided to put it into storage for the moment.\n\n\u201cThis is Bao\u2019er\u2019s first day in kindergarten. We have to go and accompany her,\u201d Ji Yanran said to Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSure. Aw, my cutey-pie is going to kindergarten!\u201d Han Sen picked up Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er had grown up a lot, and she looked like an average three-year-old now.\n\n\u201cDad, I want to stay with you! I don\u2019t want to go to school.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked troubled.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard for you to join me where I am right now. It\u2019s not a good place. When things get better, though, I will bring you with me. But for now, you should go to school,\u201d Han Sen said, encouraging Bao\u2019er.\n\nThey moved to be closer to the school. Littleflower had been kidnapped by Old Cat, so Ji Yanran was focusing her maternal efforts on Bao\u2019er instead.\n\nAfter the formalities were conducted, Bao\u2019er was left to her own devices in the kindergarten. Han Sen and Ji Yanran did not go straight home, and instead, they walked around for a while.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, I miss Littleflower.\u201d Ji Yanran\u2019s voice was quiet.\n\n\u201cMe, too. All of this is because of that blasted Old Cat. But don\u2019t worry, Littleflower is fine there. Old Cat sent me some videos, remember?\u201d Han Sen tried comforting her.\n\nOnce in a while, they\u2019d receive a new video of Littleflower. It must have been Old Cat who was sending them, but he never showed up himself.\n\n\u201cKnowing Littleflower is fine is okay and all, but I miss having him right next to me. It\u2019s like there\u2019s something missing in me, when he\u2019s not here.\u201d Ji Yanran was still sad.\n\n\u201cI will bring Littleflower home and skin that Old Cat, as soon as I am able to.\u201d Han Sen gritted his teeth as he spoke.\n\nHan Sen changed his tone and said, \u201cHow about we make a little Littleflower? When Littleflower comes back, he\u2019ll have a sibling. How about we make a few, so this place is more crowded?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that many. I am not a breeding pig.\u201d Ji Yanran looked very angry.\n\n\u201cWhere did I find such a beautiful pig?\u201d Han Sen laughed and picked her up.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? We\u2019re out in public.\u201d Ji Yanran growled.\n\n\u201cYou are my wife. I can hug you, can\u2019t I? I don\u2019t care what others think of us.\u201d\n\nIn the kindergarten, Bao\u2019er was sitting on a small chair. She held her jaw, looking miserable and bored.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, why aren\u2019t you playing with your classmates? Are you sick?\u201d A woman teacher crouched down next to her and stroked her head as she spoke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like those games. They are boring.\u201d Bao\u2019er blinked.\n\n\u201cHow about I teach you how to sing?\u201d the teacher asked.\n\n\u201cWhat song?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked the teacher.\n\nThe teacher clapped her hands and acted all cute. She said, \u201cFollow along with what I sing! I picked up a coin on the road\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTeacher, how old are you?\u201d Bao\u2019er asked, looking at her.\n\n\u201cTwenty-four. What about it?\u201d The teacher looked at Bao\u2019er strangely, unsure why she had been asked that question. \u201cYou are so old, and yet you act cute and sing stupid songs. Poor you.\u201d Bao\u2019er sighed.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s face twitched, as she was taken aback. She held back the urge to smack Bao\u2019er on the head, and simply said, \u201cI\u2026 am still young. Haha!\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-four is very old. Women like you are prone to say they are two years younger than they actually are, too. So, you are at least twenty-five. Perhaps almost thirty. I suppose you still don\u2019t even have a boyfriend yet. That is so sad. You don\u2019t have a boyfriend at that age, and you have to act all cute in the kindergarten. When you\u2019re off work, I bet you go shopping to buy pointless things and make yourself feel better about yourself.\u201d Bao\u2019er looked straight at her, and went on to say, \u201cBut on top of that, your wages are probably low. I am afraid you can only buy knock-off products. If you went to a decent brand store, you could probably only afford the cheapest items, and ask for the biggest box and bag to carry it around on the streets, trying to prove to others that you exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis d*mn kid!\u201d The teacher\u2019s face went dark, and her face twitched repeatedly. She forced a smile. \u201cIt is\u2026 not\u2026 like\u2026 that\u2026\u201d\n\nThe saddest thing was that Bao\u2019er was correct. And it made her feel extremely sad.\n\n\u201cTeacher, I think you are very good at gambling,\u201d Bao\u2019er said.\n\n\u201cNo, gambling is bad! Why would I do that? Haha\u2026\u201d The teacher\u2019s face twitched, and her smile was terribly forced.\n\n\u201cYour appearance is fair enough, but I bet at home, all you do is smoke and play mahjong. I bet the place is a dirty pigsty, too. Clothes scattered everywhere, with dirty plates molding in the sink for days.\u201d Bao\u2019er kept on talking.\n\n\u201cThis d*mn kid! D*mn kid!\u201d The teacher felt as if she was about to go insane with rage.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s eyes glanced at the woman, her eyes as thin and conniving as a con artist\u2019s. Before the teacher ran off, Bao\u2019er opened a bag and pulled out a box.\n\n\u201cTeacher, do you know what this is?\u201d Bao\u2019er shook the box.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 is the legendary lipstick, number twenty-nine from Planet Doris! How could you have it?\u201d The female teacher\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at it in amazement.\n\n\u201cYou cannot afford it, but you can tell whether it is real or fake, right?\u201d Bao\u2019er threw it at her.\n\nThe teacher caught it and looked at it as if it was a million-dollar antique.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real!\u201d The teacher opened it with shiny eyes.\n\n\u201cTeacher, how about we gamble? If you lose, give me ten dollars. If I lose, I give you this lipstick.\u201d Bao\u2019er pulled out a pair of dice and smiled.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d The teacher receded into thought.\n\n\u201cNever mind, then. I don\u2019t like this lipstick, and it is a waste. Now I have to keep on holding it.\u201d Bao\u2019er sighed, and motioned for the teacher to give it back.\n\n\u201cHang on.\u201d The teacher picked Bao\u2019er up and carried her swiftly to a storage room. She looked around like a burglar, then closed the door.\n\nOne hour later, the storage room was filled with the sound of crying. A voice was heard, saying, \u201cLeave me those ten dollars, please! Or at least leave me enough for a meal! I need it for the next two weeks!\u201d"
