    "text": "Han Sen thought, \u201cTai Yi? Is that the white-haired Tai Yi Bao\u2019er met, or is it the Tai Yi from the scroll? Is it the one that killed a god?\u201d\n\nTai Yi turned his head. He walked into the metal temple and headed for the metal altar.\n\nTai Yi was looking at the altar as he coldly said, \u201cSince you are here, why bother hiding?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He did not expect to be discovered so soon. Suddenly, someone flashed. He saw another shadow appear next to the altar.\n\n\u201cKing Jun?\u201d When Han Sen saw the person\u2019s shape, he was given a fright. He did not expect to see Sky God King Jun there.\n\n\u201cIs this metal temple King Jun\u2019s temple? No way. King Jun is a fire element God Spirit. He does not really associate himself with metal. Plus, the altar is broken. I do not think anything good happened to the God Spirit that once resided here.\u201d Han Sen was thinking about many things. \u201cTai Yi, I never thought you would make it back alive,\u201d King Jun coldly said. Tai Yi looked at King Jun and replied, \u201cI do not care if I live or if I die, but you? You care for your life so much, yet you risk entry into the universe. Are you not afraid of being able to return to your own temple?\u201d King Jun looked at him with disdain and asked, \u201cDo you think you are still in the Sacred era? The people in the universe are lucky to keep themselves alive. Why would they come and seek trouble from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this time, no matter how bad things become, there are still god sadnesses, right?\u201d Tai Yi asked with a laugh.\n\nKing Jun\u2019s expression was cold. He grunted. \u201cTai Yi, Nine Night God was murdered inside a temple, and that thing was stolen. Was it you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just taking back what belonged to me,\u201d Tai Yi icily replied.\n\n\u201cDid you not know that thing was so important to me?\u201d King Jun angrily asked.\n\n\u201cI know it is.\u201d Tai Yi nodded.\n\n\u201cWhy would you take it if you knew?\u201d King Jun harshly asked.\n\nTai Yi calmly looked at King Jun said, \u201cIt does not matter to me if it is important to you.\u201d \u201cFine. Fine. Fine. Tai Yi, are you really going to make yourself my enemy?\u201d It looked as if King Jun\u2019s face was turning green. He was so angry that he laughed.\n\n\u201cWhen you become Sky God King Jun, you and I will not be friends. There will be no favors owed between us, so there will be no breaking up.\u201d Tai Yi looked like he did not care.\n\n\u201cFine. Fine. Fine. If you ever find yourself in trouble, I will sit back and watch.\u201d King Jun was furious. He waved his sleeves and left. He instantly disappeared.\n\nTai Yi remained in front of the altar, but he did not speak. After a while, he said, \u201cIt must be uncomfortable hiding there. You should come on out.\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought there must have been another creature about. He looked around, but no one else appeared.\n\n\u201cI am talking about you. Who are you looking for?\u201d Tai Yi\u2019s expression looked a bit weird. He looked at the wall Han Sen was hiding behind.\n\nHan Sen knew Tai Yi must have discovered his location. He coughed and stepped out from the broken wall. He said, \u201cI just did not want to disturb you and Sky God King Jun\u2019s discussion. I did not mean to eavesdrop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were here before me,\u201d Tai Yi said with a nod. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t eavesdropping.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He was surprised Tai Yi had discovered him already. The skill to hide his presence did not work.\n\n\u201cCrystallizer?\u201d Tai Yi looked at Han Sen with interest.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Han Sen nodded.\n\nAfter checking him out, Tai Yi said, \u201cNo. You are not a crystallizer. You are a human.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. Even God believed he was a crystallizer, yet Tai Yi believed he was human. Something had to be going on.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked with a frown.\n\nled\n\nTai Yi laughed. \u201cI did not expect humans to come crawling out of the sanctuary after my brief nap. It seems that it was worth the Sacred Leader\u2019s effort way back then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do humans have to do with Sacred Leader?\u201d Han Sen was stunned. He remembered humans were a part of the crystallizer, but he did not think they had a connection to Sacred Leader.\n\nIf they were related, crystallizers would have taken over Sacred Leader\u2019s shelters.\n\nTai Yi knew about the sanctuaries, so he knew humans came from the sanctuaries. It also did not seem as if he was lying.\n\nTai Yi laughed but did not answer. He turned around and looked at the broken altar. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so weak. I cannot help you.\u201d Tai Yi looked weird. Han Sen did not want to make promises, but he wanted to learn secrets about the humans from Tai Yi. He did not really want to refuse outright.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing too difficult,\u201d Tai Yi said. \u201cI want to fix this altar. The materials needed are here already, but we need some pure water to fix it. Can you use a water geno art?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can use a water geno art or two, but why are you fixing the altar?\u201d Han Sen was confused. He did not understand Tai Yi.\n\nHearing him talk with King Jun, Tai Yi did not seem to be on good terms with Sky God King Jun, but he also knew about Sacred Leader and the sanctuaries. Now, he wanted to fix the altar. Han Sen could not tell which side he might ultimately be serving.\n\nKing Jun had said he entered a temple and killed a God Spirit. Han Sen was pretty convinced that Tai Yi was the Godslayer Tai Yi from the scroll.\n\nTai Yi did not answer Han Sen. He removed many materials from the broken altar. He flicked his fingers. A white fire descended onto the altar. The white fire burned the entire altar. Flames enveloped the altar.\n\nHan Sen stood next to the altar, but he could not feel the fire\u2019s heat. The altar\u2019s materials turned into juice, which filled up the cracks inside the altar.\n\nThe altar was burning like hot, red steel. It was half-transparent.\n\nThe melted juice flowed into the altar. The cracks inside the altar filled up and slowly vanished. Not long after, it looked like a perfect altar but was crystallized. It was like a crystal.\n\n\u201cHelp me out with the water,\u201d Tai Yi coldly said.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart jumped. He followed Tai Yi\u2019s instructions and used a water geno art. He generated a lot of water to spray the altar. The water was poured on the altar. Before it touched the altar, the water was vaporized.\n\n\u201cWe need more to cool the whole altar down,\u201d Tai Yi said.\n\nHan Sen increased his power. He got more water to hit the altar. Han Sen tried his hardest, but the water was unable to douse the altar. Despite being like the tide, the water was vaporized in the air.\n\n\u201cVery powerful Tai Yi.\u201d Now, Han Sen had a better understanding of how scary Tai Yi\u2019s fire power was.\n\nSince Han Sen had already committed, he was not going to give up. He clutched his Ancient Water God origin and simulated Ancient Water God\u2019s presence. He then fired water at the altar.\n\nChee!\n\nThe water hit the altar. White smoke rose from the altar. The burning, crystal-looking altar was stone again."
