    "text": "Moon Shadow God wanted to retreat into the darkness. Han Sen realized she was very nimble, but her moving distance with each evasion was very short. It was like she hadn\u2019t moved at all.\n\nThe radius of the time area was very small. Unless the enemy was at a close distance, it was very difficult to restrict and restrain the movements of an opponent.\n\nEarlier, Moon Shadow God thought Han Sen would be killed by the death angel. There was also a bai sema to keep them apart. That was why she stood so close to Han Sen. Only the bai sema kept them apart. She wanted to watch Han Sen get killed at close range.\n\nBut Bao\u2019er had turned into death angel. After hitting the death angel, the bai sema broke. Moon Shadow God was exposed and directly in front of Han Sen. Time area was able to touch Moon Shadow God.\n\nMoon Shadow God could not move by much, but Han Sen\u2019s knife air hit Moon Shadow God like it was hitting a shadow. It went right through her image. He was unable to damage her.\n\nHan Sen slashed a few times, but it was the same result each time. He was not able to touch Moon Shadow God\u2019s body. Moon Shadow God coldly laughed and said, \u201cTime area is such a strong power. How long are you going to last? When the time area disappears, it will be time for me to avenge the death of my son.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid you will never have that chance,\u201d Han Sen coldly replied. He put the stone lantern in front of him and brought out the Shield of the Medusa\u2019s Gaze. He activated Medusa\u2019s Gaze.\n\nTwo weird lights went through the flame, which was dyed white. When the Gaze went toward Moon Shadow God, she was trapped by the time area. She was unable to move. She had to generate Moon Shadow power to fight it.\n\nMedusa\u2019s Gaze, which had been boosted by the fire, froze Moon Shadow God\u2019s body. It made her freeze in the air.\n\nMedusa\u2019s Gaze was a true god weapon, and it was reinforced by the lantern. Even a true god would not be able to block it. She was frozen. She was like a dead person.\n\nHan Sen ignored Moon Shadow God. He looked at Bao\u2019er, who was still fighting the death angel. He noticed Bao\u2019er had an advantage on the enemy, and she was able to keep suppressing the death angel.\n\nWhen the power and geno arts were in the same situation, Bao\u2019er\u2019s power and geno arts had the Han family legacy. Her timing and understanding of combat were impeccable. At the very least, it far exceeded the death angel. She was beating the death angel, which had the same level of power as her.\n\nDong!\n\nBao\u2019er was slashing on the death angel\u2019s chest. She cut open its chest armor. Han Sen noticed that the death angel\u2019s armor did not show flesh beyond. There was only white light.\n\n\u201cIt really isn\u2019t a living thing,\u201d Han Sen complimentarily said. \u201cEverything Sacred Leader does is a bit beyond belief. I cannot believe he made such a powerful machine. If he was able to make many death angels, it would be easy for him to conquer the world.\u201d\n\nThe death angel kept getting injured, but it refused to concede. It was like it did not know about pain or fear. It continued to fight Bao\u2019er.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe death angel\u2019s head was cut off by Han Sen. It didn\u2019t die though. The fire from its neck continued to burn, and it was still headed for Bao\u2019er.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s body flashed. She slashed open the death angel\u2019s chest piece, revealing a white-colored crystal inside.\n\nBao\u2019er flew right at her enemy. She grabbed hold of the crystal. Suddenly, the white light of the death angel\u2019s body was gone, which led to the armor crumbling into itself.\n\n\u201cDad.\u201d Bao\u2019er flew back and returned to her true self. She looked very tired. It looked as if she had used the sunglasses too much.\n\nHan Sen quickly held her. Bao\u2019er was like a cat in Han Sen\u2019s arms. She looked super tired. She almost immediately fell asleep in Han Sen\u2019s arms.\n\nHan Sen rarely saw Bao\u2019er tired. He thought, \u201cUsing the sunglasses is quite the drain of energy. Even Bao\u2019er was unable to last long.\u201d\n\nHe picked up the death angel\u2019s crystal, which was in Bao\u2019er\u2019s hands. There were a lot of sides to the crystal. The shape of it was rather oval. It was shiny on the inside, and it released a scary power.\n\n\u201cI wonder what this thing is made of. If there are no announcements for its killing, I presume it cannot be a xenogeneic gene.\u201d Han Sen did not understand what the crystal was for, so he put it away.\n\nHan Sen was going to exit the area, but he suddenly thought about Moon Shadow God. Next to the big crack was the death angel and the entrance to the holy garden.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cI do not know what sort of place the holy garden is. If Sacred Leader wanted the death angel to guard there, that means there must be something important worth guarding. If the death angel that guards the door is dead, maybe I should go into the garden and see what is there. Perhaps I will find something.\u201d\n\nHe had entered Sacred to find Littleflower. He also wanted to learn more about Sacred. This was a very important place, so he had to explore it.\n\nHan Sen was holding the stone lantern. He shone its light below the big crack. It was very dark. There did not seem to be a bottom. It was unknown how deep it was.\n\nHan Sen held the stone lantern and carefully entered the crack. After he flew down for a short amount of time, he was able to confirm that there was no danger. He then allowed the big goldfish and little goldfish to fly in.\n\nHan Sen held the still-sleeping Bao\u2019er as he descended atop the big goldfish\u2019s back. It was pitch black down there, so Han Sen did not dare allow the big goldfish to fly down too quickly. He went down slowly. After an hour, he saw something flicker down below.\n\n\u201cA long, bright lantern\u2026\u201d Han Sen stared at it for a while. He suddenly noticed a door by the long, bright lantern.\n\nHe let the big goldfish go toward the long, bright lantern. The closer he got to the long, bright lantern, the more he used its light to highlight the stone door. The door was not as powerful as the Sacred door. It was just a very small stone door. It looked like the entrance to a garden.\n\nAfter he got close enough, he saw the sign above the door, which said, \u201cHoly Garden.\u201d\n\nThe door was open, but it looked as if what lay beyond was not in ruins. The conditions of it were still quite good. As Han Sen stood in front of the door, he could see the view beyond it.\n\nHe saw the holy garden had many long, bright lanterns there. They lit up the entire place. When Han Sen had been above, he had not seen any lights.\n\nThe holy garden had a pavilion and some buildings. There were fake mountains, flowers, and grass. It looked very elegant. The combat had not reached and destroyed that place. Its condition was remarkably fine.\n\nWhen Han Sen looked at one of the pavilions, his expression changed. Someone was sitting in the pavilion."
