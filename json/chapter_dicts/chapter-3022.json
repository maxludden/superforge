    "text": "Every race was shocked. Up until now, only Han Sen, Bai King, and a few others had challenged an Annihilation class God Spirit. Now, someone was going straight to the geno hall. People were stunned. Littleflower landed on the geno hall plaza. Before he started speaking, a serious and cold god voice sounded in the god hall. \u201cDo you know how bad the crime of humiliating the god hall is?\u201d\n\nThe scary God Spirit door of the geno hall opened. Many lamp fires were shining from the interior. A body with a lantern fire walking out. One was not able to see the face, but it was still scary. People would have been scared by just seeing it. Littleflower stared at the shadow of the person who had emerged from the geno hall and said, \u201cI did not mean to offend the God Spirits, but I have come here for Qin Lan. Give me Qin Lan, and I will leave.\u201d\n\nHan Sen, who was on the cold planet, had his eyes open wide. He looked at Littleflower before the geno hall. It had been so many years, but he still recognized him. He was certain that was Littleflower.\n\n\u201cWhat is Littleflower doing there?\u201d Han Sen was in a rush. He knew how scary the geno god hall was. An Annihilation class God Spirit was fine. They were just very powerful. He had fought with one and been able to stand a chance.\n\nBut that guy who called himself a god was mysterious. He was not just powerful. He was more than that one word.\n\n\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d Han Yufei looked at Littleflower standing in the god hall plaza. She frowned and said to herself, \u201cSacred Leader\u2019s armor is still here. Why did it turn into that?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that, Han Sen\u2019s body shook while hearing that. \u201cWhat do you mean? Is Littleflower wearing Qin Xiu\u2019s armor?\u201d He had a few dire thoughts over what that might mean.\n\nHan Yufei was surprised. She looked at Han Sen and asked, \u201cDo you know the person wearing that armor?\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is my son,\u201d Han Sen replied. He quickly asked, \u201cDid you say that armor is Sacred Leader\u2019s armor? What is going on?\u201d.\n\n\u201cYour son?\u201d Han Yufei was shocked. She did not answer Han Sen\u2019s question. She looked very untrusting as she asked, \u201cAre you sure the person wearing that armor is your son?\u201d After she asked that, she asked another question. \u201cIs he your biological son?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pretty sure that is my biological son,\u201d Han Sen said with confidence. \u201cHe was taken by Nine-Life Cat when he was small. He was taken to the holy palace, but I am sure that is now him.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was not going to get that wrong. That was because they were related, as well as the feeling of that king spirit body. Aside from his son, there was no one else in the universe that would have it.\n\n\u201cThat is quite weird. Your genes mostly came from the crystallizers. As for your son, no matter how he got your genes, he could only be a crystallizer. There is no way he should have been able to wear that armor. Unless\u2026\u201d Han Yufei\u2019s face looked serious.\n\n\u201cUnless what?\u201d Han Sen could not wait to crack open Han Yufei\u2019s head to get answers from in there.\n\n\u201cThat is impossible.\u201d Han Yufei shook her head, seemingly denying her initial guess.\n\n\u201cJust tell me what you wanted to say.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s heart was in a rush and felt like it was on fire.\n\n\u201cI am not so sure. If I say it, it will be irresponsible of me. My guess is unlikely to be correct. Let\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d Han Yufei looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cIt is pointless to rush things. Even if that is really your son, you cannot go there. Before you can control your blue blood, going to the geno hall is like making a death wish. As for this guy, who you claim is your son, if he is really wearing Sacred Leader\u2019s armor, he might stand a chance. Right now, you just need to stay calm. You need to reach the absolute still mode. At that time, if your son is struggling to defeat the God Spirits, you might be able to go and save him.\u201d\n\nHan Sen understood that, but he had been trying to enter absolute still mode for a month. He had failed the entire time. It made his heart feel rushed and burn. He was not able to quiet it down.\n\n\u201cI must calm down. Han Yufei is right. I must have enough power to sort out this problem.\u201d Han Sen took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down.\n\nAt this time, the body had already walked out of the geno hall\u2019s door. As the person walked out of the door, the geno hall door closed.\n\n\u201cMoment God!\u201d The universe finally saw who emerged from the geno hall.\n\nHan Sen saw it too, but he was not surprised. He once heard God say that the geno hall was guarded by 12 Annihilation class God Spirits. Perhaps this was the time when Moment God guarded geno hall. Moment God looked as cold as usual. She stood atop the steps of the geno hall door. She looked down from a high place at Littleflower and said, \u201cWhatever the reason is for you to have come, a blasphemy against the god hall can only result in death.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Moment God\u2019s arms rose slowly. She pointed a finger at Littleflower. It flickered with some scary light. When the finger was outstretched, a weird wave covered the whole of the god space. It was like time was frozen. Everything was frozen.\n\nMoment God\u2019s time-stopping power was something everybody had seen in the previous fight. It was still so unbelievable seeing it again. Seeing Moment God\u2019s finger movement was already in front of Littleflower, everybody thought Littleflower could only take the hit and be rendered unable to fight back.\n\nYet, Littleflower was moving even when time stopped. He waved his fist and pointed at Moment God.\n\nPang!\n\nA scary white light flame broke Moment God\u2019s finger light. It was like an asteroid that was madly going to Moment God. Moment God\u2019s face changed. Her body flashed and avoided the punching power.\n\nThe flaming fist struck the geno hall door. It made loud explosion sounds. Although no one was able to hurt the geno hall door, the door was shaking nonstop. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d All the creatures were shocked.\n\nMoment God\u2019s strength impressed everyone. Now, someone had broken the time-stopping power. One punch had managed to break the finger light. Moment God did not dare fight this face-to-face. That was how scary that power was. \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has very scary power. Since when did the universe have an elite like this?\u201d\n\nEvery race of the universe was in complete shock. They were all talking about it. Some old antiques from ancient times had expressions that kept changing. They looked terrible.\n\n\u201cI do not want to kill. Don\u2019t make me go in there. Give me Qin Lan.\u201d Littleflower was stepping toward the geno hall\u2019s door. His face looked certain and confident.\n\n\u201cMoment\u2026 Light\u2026\u201d Moment Goddess did not answer. A mysterious wave flickered on her body. It was like it pushed a river of time and made the river of time flow faster. The time went by like an arrow. One moment was a thousand or a hundred years."
