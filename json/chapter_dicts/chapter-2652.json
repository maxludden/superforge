    "text": "Han Sen listened carefully as Exquisite explained the situation to him in more detail. The star tree was guarded by seniors of the Very High. Every silkworm of the Very High was allowed one chance to claim star fruit from its boughs.\n\nBut how many star fruit could be collected would be determined by tests conducted by the aforementioned seniors of the Very High.\n\nThe test results correlated with how many star fruits could be obtained. Even if the results weren\u2019t great, a participant was always guaranteed at least one. Ten star fruits was generally the most one could receive.\n\nBut the tests were highly variable depending on which Very High senior was administering them.\n\n\u201cThe personality of your particular administrator is very unique. If he likes you, he will only ask you a few questions. Then, he will let you claim seven or eight fruits. If he doesn\u2019t like you, he will give you a very difficult question. If you answer correctly, you will only be allowed a small number of star fruits\u2026 I hope the man will like you.\u201d Exquisite\u2019s eyes looked strange as she spoke.\n\n\u201cIs he often that unreasonable? Is there any point of a test if he just gets to decide regardless? Just make it a beauty contest or something, then,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\nExquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking, so she laughed. \u201cThe star tree belongs to the uncle alone. Who he shares the fruit with is entirely his decision. Being willing to share with those far younger than him is already a grand act of kindness. So, even if he gives you only one star fruit, you should still be appreciative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. That makes sense then. If they are his items, then he can definitely dictate the distribution of them,\u201d Han Sen said with a nod.\n\n\u201cThis is just a small reward. My generation will soon begin testing silkworms in earnest. If you perform well when that happens, the resources you receive will far exceed the star fruit,\u201d Exquisite said.\n\n\u201cHow long must we wait?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cThere are thirteen of us in my generation. Now, there is only one little sister who has yet to decide on a silkworm. Once she has made her decision, the tests will begin.\u201d When Exquisite spoke of her little sister, her eyes glimmered strangely.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart felt weird hearing this, too. But he carefully kept his thoughts away from the subject.\n\nThe little sister Exquisite was referring to was undoubtedly Li Keer. Li Keer wanted Dollar, so Han Sen knew all about that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. We should head to the star tree.\u201d Exquisite placed a hand on Han Sen\u2019s shoulder. Then, she teleported Han Sen and Bao\u2019er away from Underworld Lake.\n\nThere were still many Xuan Yellow Sutra pages left to collect, and Han Sen wanted to carry on fishing them all out, but it was a long task that he couldn\u2019t rush. He would have to wait for the chance to fish again later.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw the star tree, he was shocked. Its boughs almost blanketed the whole sky. It was like a big umbrella that formed a bridge between the land and the sky itself.\n\nMany pieces of fruit hung from the tree\u2019s branches. They looked like suns, and their light made the leaves of the tree shine like jade. It was so very beautiful, and Han Sen squinted against the light.\n\nAccording to what Exquisite had told him, the test administrator\u2019s personality was quite strange. But his story was a legendary one.\n\nWhen a child of the Very High was born, it would be put into one of two factions. One faction was responsible for reproducing. They were the ordinary Very High, and they didn\u2019t practice the Very High Sense. Their personalities were comparatively normal, and they retained emotions like an ordinary person would. They were similar to Liyu Zhen.\n\nThe other faction was the one Exquisite studied with. They learned the Very High Sense, and at the end of their practice, their emotions were practically non-existent. Their strength and combat prowess, however, were the best of the Very High.\n\nWhen a Very High was born, it was decided which path they would take.\n\nThis man was like Exquisite. He practiced Very High Sense, and he had reached deified class with it. He had been only a step away from becoming a true god.\n\nBut then, he destroyed his Very High Sense and started anew. Not even Exquisite knew why the man had taken such drastic action.\n\nBut as he began practicing again, the elder guarded the star tree and never left its side. Even the other Very High didn\u2019t know what level he was at currently.\n\n\u201cUncle.\u201d Exquisite brought Han Sen beneath the boughs of the star tree and bowed to the roots of the tree.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er looked in the direction she was bowing, and there, they saw a giant stone tree root. Despite being made of stone, the root still seemed to be alive and growing. There was a gray-haired man of the Very High sitting on it.\n\nThe wrinkles in his face appeared rougher than the bark of the tree. His white beard reached the ground. He remained sitting where he was, his eyes closed. He was so old that he looked like he\u2019d been petrified.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the man\u2019s appearance. With the power of the Very High, they could keep themselves looking young until the moment they died. Doing that wasn\u2019t difficult. He wondered why this man\u2019s face looked so old.\n\nUpon hearing Exquisite\u2019s voice, the old man opened his eyes. His eyelids were very wrinkly, too. He could barely open a small slit to see through. If one didn\u2019t look closely, one would never realize that his eyes were open at all.\n\nThe old man looked at Exquisite. Then, he turned to Han Sen and Bao\u2019er. With a rough voice, he said, \u201cIt is Exquisite. Have you brought your silkworm? Is it the big one or the small one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name is Han Sen. He is a crystallizer\u2026\u201d Exquisite introduced Han Sen and Bao\u2019er to him.\n\n\u201cYou selected a crystallizer? That takes a lot of courage,\u201d the old man said. He observed Han Sen\u2019s body well. He started to say something more, but he suddenly saw a person teleporting in front of him.\n\n\u201cUncle,\u201d the new man said, bowing to the elder.\n\n\u201cLiyu Zhen, what are you doing here?\u201d Han Sen and Exquisite\u2019s heart asked the same question.\u201cLiyu Zhen, please wait aside for a moment. Allow me to help Exquisite\u2019s silkworm conduct the test. Then it will be your turn,\u201d the old man said, signaling him to stand aside for a while.\n\nWhen Liyu Zhen heard the command, he bowed to the old man and said, \u201cUncle, if things are like that, why don\u2019t we conduct our tests together?\u201d\n\nHan Sen and Exquisite, when they heard it, felt a shock. They didn\u2019t know what was going on in Liyu Zhen\u2019s mind to make such a proposal.\n\nWhen the old man heard this request, he went silent. Then, he nodded and said, \u201cWhy not? We can save some time. Let us do the tests together, then.\u201d\n\nExquisite was unsettled. Usually, ordinary Very High silkworms conducted their tests alone. And people of the Very High never had to undergo these tests at all. She was confused by why Liyu Zhen wanted to take a test, as well.\n\nThe old man seemed to understand what Exquisite was wondering. And so he said, \u201cI have to travel soon. Others have recommended that Liyu Zhen protect the star tree in my absence. If he can pass the test, he will be in charge of the star tree temporarily.\u201d\n\nHan Sen felt lucky. It was good that they had come now. If they came when Liyu Zhen was guarding the star tree, there was a chance Liyu Zhen would deliberately make the test difficult for him."
