She had not expected Xie Qing King would be able to actually open ten gene locks and defeat Gold General.\n\nBut whether or not he\u2019d live to see another day had yet to be determined. He had exhausted far too much strength and energy in unleashing that devastating hit, and it had left him on death\u2019s door. At the very least, he had helped turn the tides on the enemy and give them a hope of pulling through to emerge victorious.\n\n\u201cIf that little girl can drive the final few nails into Demon Cup Emperor\u2019s coffin, we might just pull through this,\u201d Moment Queen thought to herself, as she looked on Zero with hopeful eyes.\n\nCup Demon Emperor had been killed by the Bone Dagger again, but just like last time, he had been brought to life out of another bug.\n\nHe had been killed four times by now, but no matter what Zero did, he kept coming back a few seconds later.\n\nIt was as if a bug took on his appearance, lifeforce, and everything about him. They behaved like him and even made use of his powers to the same strength and extent.\n\nMoment Queen watched the bugs intently, whenever she could. There had to be something she could learn through observation, a trick or a puzzle she could decipher, which could lead to a solution they could employ in taking out Cup Demon Emperor for good.\n\nThe bugs that turned into Cup Demon Emperor did not look all that special compared to the several others that were buzzing around. It seemed to her as if any random bug of his could serve as a re-animation host.\n\n\u201cWhat is this power he wields? Gah! We need information if we are to solve this conundrum.\u201d Moment Queen wracked her mind for a possible solution.\n\nShe watched the proceedings for a while, but she was unable to learn anything.\n\nIf Serpent Throne was with them, things would be considerably easier, she believed.\n\nMoment Queen wondered where it was, and recalled it was currently in Thunder Hell Shelter. Even if it was to come over and aid in the battle, it would take a good long while to arrive. There was a great distance separating this shelter from the others.\n\nCup Demon Emperor frowned, seeing his beloved Gold General be killed.\n\nFor a berserk super creature like that to be killed by a spirit that had just opened ten gene locks, he thought it was humiliating.\n\n\u201cI need to hurry up and end all these vermin,\u201d Cup Demon Emperor said to himself, as his eyes flashed with an ominous thunder.\n\nSuddenly, countless bugs appeared, each of them turning into a carbon copy of Cup Demon Emperor. They all flew forward in a swarm to put an end to the girl that had caused him so much strife.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s face turned grim when she saw this. She thought he could only copy himself once.\n\nBut all of a sudden, there were now six Cup Demon Emperors coming for the girl. With the real one, that made seven.\n\nShe observed each of them, noting how they were all as powerful as each other, all as powerful as the real Cup Demon Emperor.\n\nMoment Queen was worried, thinking the girl might end up getting killed. The girl had defied her expectations, but what she was faced with now was far greater than anything that had come before.\n\nBut with events concerning Zero, a defiance of expectations was a common occurrence. Moment Queen almost had her socks blown off, when she saw Zero slay each and every copy of Cup Demon Emperor with ease. It truly was as if she was swatting a bunch of bothersome flies.\n\nEvery time she attacked, there\u2019d be one Cup Demon Emperor less to deal with.\n\nBut when these Cup Demon Emperor copies died, more and more were summoned to take their places.\n\nMoment Queen was flabbergasted. Even when she was at her strongest, at peak performance before her fall from grace, not even she had achieved such wild amounts of power.\n\nAlthough the girl could not kill Cup Demon Emperor entirely, she had easily exerted what was necessary to do so many times over. And she had greatly suppressed Cup Demon Emperor and his plans by killing him over and over, not letting him go free to deal with other matters on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cSo, how do we kill him once and for all?\u201d Moment Queen was still searching for the answer.\n\nShe noticed ten was the max number of copies he could create of himself at any given time.\n\n\u201cI may not know what power he possesses, but there is no way he can keep respawning so easily. Unless his true body is not connected to these or something? Would that mean none of those bodies are real? And if that was so, where does his true self lie?\u201d Moment Queen\u2019s mind was a tangled brush of questions right now.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s eyes then flashed. In her mind, she recorded the precise moment a bug turned into a copy of Cup Demon Emperor.\n\nShe kept replaying the sight in her mind, over and over again, desperate to learn something new or find the trick to this entire shenanigan.\n\nAnd eventually, she did catch something strange.\n\nShe smiled, thinking she might have learned something. She said to herself, \u201cThey really aren\u2019t real. They\u2019re little more than doppelgangers.\u201d\n\nMoment Queen was not entirely correct. If it was a doppelganger, Zero would have been able to kill the real one just as easily. The Asura Sutra could destroy the spirit stone when killing the spirit itself, after all.\n\nThe fabricated emperors were like pets of Cup Demon Emperor himself.\n\nHe placed his power in one bug and turned it into a copy of himself. When that \u201ccup\u201d was killed, he could make another one just as easily as he had made the first.\n\nAnd because Cup Demon Emperor had opened ten gene locks, he could create ten active cups at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately, that did not matter much. Moment Queen only wanted to find out where the real Cup Demon Emperor was. Cut off the head of the snake, and the body dies, after all.\n\nSuddenly, she smiled again, saying, \u201cAha! I found you.\u201d"
