In forty days, he could obtain the items it was going to yield.\n\nHe still wasn\u2019t sure what the hand or the hammer items were, but Dragon King seemed certain that the knight was a Twin Knight, despite the peculiarity of it being born on this tree.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t want to leave empty-handed, though. He wanted to wait there until the fruit could mature.\n\nHan Sen moved the underground shelter to a well-hidden place not too far from Thunder Hell Shelter. If they were unable to defend Thunder Hell Shelter, when the not-so-far-away hostiles came to attack, they could retreat to the underground shelter and make a daring escape.\n\nHan Sen left the well and told Water Fairy to keep an eye on it, and make sure no one intruded. He then went to one of the palaces in the shelter to do some reading.\n\nHan Sen wanted to figure out what manner of information the Xuan Men fellow had given him. He had already had it translated into the modern language, so now he could read it all with simplicity.\n\nThere was info regarding the Xuantian Technique, on which the Dongxuan Sutra had been based. The Xuantian Technique was good, but it was quite different than the finalized Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nThe Xuantian Technique was the original skill, but the Dongxuan Sutra had been created by Dongxuan Zi after he broke through the vacuum.\n\nHan Sen decided to learn the Xuantian Technique, while applying what he had learned through his time with the Dongxuan Sutra.\n\nThere was a lot Han Sen would be able to learn from it, despite it not being in its entirely original format. The Xuantian Technique was ancient, and over the ages, parts of it had been modified.\n\nHan Sen learned a lot from it, and he noticed that many hyper geno arts could be easily blended with it. Han Sen selected one to practice with and used the Dongxuan Sutra as a base. He was still able to use a hyper geno art that had been combined with the Xuantian Technique.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have much time, though. So, Han Sen only picked one, thinking he could use it against Saint Fan if he ever had to fight him.\n\nHan Sen decided to practice a skill called Xuanmi Movement, which had its origins based on Xuantian Movement. Dongxuan Movement was based on Xuantian Movement, as well.\n\nBut Dongxuan Movement had been modified a lot for the Dongxuan Sutra, making it a much greater fit. Xuanmi Movement was terrific, and it was very adaptable, in how it could combine with modern skills.\n\nHan Sen used Xuanmi Movement with Dongxuan Movement to try it out, and he found it to be rather easy. In less than two days, he had already become proficient with it.\n\nAfter a while, Han Sen also finished going through the information provided to him by Professor Long. After reclining back to think through what he had read, Han Sen finally thought he had figured out a way in which he could combine speeding up time and teleportation. But for this, he would have to start creating a brand new hyper geno art.\n\n\u201cSpeeding up time and teleportation? This could actually work,\u201d Han Sen said to himself.\n\nHan Sen continued his research for the next few days, and he stayed away from the Alliance in case Saint Fan showed up.\n\nHalf a month passed with no sign of an enemy force. The emperor tree in the well had not yet matured, either. Ghost Eye, however, came running back to the shelter in a strange panic.\n\n\u201cSaint Fan is here!\u201d Dry Bone translated what Ghost Eye had to say, amidst his panting.\n\nWhen Han Sen heard, he raced out of his room to prepare. Everyone else abandoned what they were doing and went to join him.\n\nQueen and Zero were the only humans there, as the rest were in the underground shelter.\n\nFor a fight like this, most humans would be little more than cannon fodder.\n\n\u201cWhat do we face?\u201d Baby Ghost asked. He had managed to open three gene locks after starting from scratch, but he was still in no condition to fight what now faced them.\n\nGhost Eye was making a noise, pointing at something in the distance. He had very good eyesight, which was why Han Sen selected him as a scout.\n\nDry Bone King translated what he had to say again, \u201cSaint Fan, with his army in tow, is five hundred miles away. He has seen five super creatures and three king spirits accompanying him. But to pad out the forces, swathes of smaller creatures have come, too. With the emperor himself showing his face, do you think we should fall back?\u201d\n\nDry Bone King added the last sentence himself, as he doubted their strength in repelling such a foe. If his father had failed to defeat Saint Fan Emperor, there was no chance he could.\n\n\u201cWhatchu\u2019 afraid of, son? We haven\u2019t got nothing to fear. We\u2019ve got the greater hand here,\u201d Xie Qing King said, as he puffed on a cigar.\n\n\u201cHe is an emperor. Realistically, now would be the time for us to go. We can always come back. Living to fight another day sounds worthwhile to me,\u201d Baby Ghost said.\n\nWater Fairy chimed in to say, \u201cYou should stop arguing and just do whatever our master tells us.\u201d\n\nEveryone turned to look at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThese colors don\u2019t run. I\u2019m fighting, no matter what. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m without an escape plan, if things truly turn awry. If their forces are overwhelming, we can return to the underground shelter,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen did not want to lose the emperor tree just yet, and the last thing he wanted was for an emperor to easily claim the goodies he himself had fought to obtain.\n\nHan Sen could deal with the king spirits and super creatures without much issue. It was the emperor himself that presented the problem. He wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d muster what it would take to bring the emperor down.\n\nOrdinary king spirits could not fight him, and Purple Emperor wasn\u2019t a true emperor yet, either.\n\n\u201cPurple Emperor can fight with my berserk gold raven beast soul, and I myself have super king spirit mode and Little Angel. All hope is not lost, and at the very least, fleeing will remain a viable option. I can escape whenever I wish,\u201d Han Sen mulled to himself."
