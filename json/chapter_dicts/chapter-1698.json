    "text": "Han Yufei\u2019s expression looked dire. The gap between their strengths was too wide to cover. If Rudy and the others used geno armor that originally belonged to others, Han Yufei reckoned he could make battle with them. He could possibly kill them, too.\n\nBut someone who had generated their own self-geno armor was in another league entirely.\n\nHan Yufei knew there was nothing he could do right now. So, the best he could come up with was buying more time by throwing his own fist to meet Yake\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d Yake snorted coldly, channeling even more strength into his fist He was primed to deliver the blow straight to Han Yufei\u2019s head.\n\nJi Yanran thought it was strange, seeing what was going on high above. It seemed as if they were fighting amongst themselves.\n\nLuo Lan looked at Han Yufei and suddenly felt a great worry come over her. Although Han Yufei had transformed and didn\u2019t look the same, when Luo Lan looked into his eyes, she could sense something.\n\nJust as Han Yufei was about to get punched by Yake, a hand suddenly blocked that immense fist and extinguished all that power. It was as if the punch had never been thrown.\n\n\u201cStay Up Late?\u201d Luo Lan and the others were shocked. Somehow, Stay Up Late was up near Han Yufei, blocking Yake\u2019s punch.\n\nStay Up Late had seen Han Yufei save Luo Lan once before. Seeing this same, familiar person try to attack Yake from behind, Stay Up Late recognized him.\n\nStay Up Late blocked Yake\u2019s fist and immediately pulled Han Yufei away from Yake. Then he simply said, \u201cGo back to the Han family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Han Yufei was in shock, but he knew now was not the time for talk. So he held his arm and flew towards Ji Yanran\u2019s building.\n\nYake looked at Stay Up Late. He didn\u2019t bother trying to pursue Han Yufei, and he simply stared at Stay Up Late.\n\n\u201cYou are a crystallizer?\u201d Yake asked, looking up at Stay Up Late.\n\n\u201cI did not expect there to be another crystallizer survivor, apart from myself.\u201d Stay Up Late looked at Yake.\n\n\u201cAs a crystallizer, you have chosen to work for a human?\u201d Yake asked.\n\n\u201cI observe the Han family,\u201d Stay Up Late answered. \u201cWhy are you killing those of another race? They could be qualified. You should not kill them.\u201d\n\nYake laughed mockingly. \u201cObserve? The crystallizers were destroyed long ago. That thing doesn\u2019t exist, so it is pointless to observe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am still here,\u201d Stay Up Late said quietly.\n\n\u201cSo what? Even if you are a crystallizer, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d Yake snorted and threw a punch at Stay Up Late.\n\nStay Up Late deployed his armor, but he didn\u2019t fight Yake. He evaded the attack so that Yake only hit air.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dare fight?\u201d Yake looked a little annoyed. He hated Stay Up Late\u2019s face, the way it was currently.\n\n\u201cI am a soldier, and the oaths I am bound to forbid me from issuing harm to just anyone,\u201d Stay Up Late said coldly. His face did not change.\n\n\u201cSoldier? The crystallizers are gone. There are no more soldiers. There are no more oaths. I am the oathmaker now.\u201d When Yake said that, he summoned greater strength and tried to strike Stay Up Late.\n\nStay Up Late managed to dodge the raging attack, and after, he said, \u201cThe oath is in my blood, regardless of whether or not the crystallizers exist\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, let me see your blood so I can check for the presence of these oaths.\u201d Yake\u2019s armor started to glow, shattering the dimension around him.\n\nBut no matter how Yake attacked, nothing he did enabled him to land a strike on Stay Up Late.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fight back.\u201d Yake looked cruel as he punched a building. His fist was like a meteor, plummeting into a building with the intent of killing everyone inside.\n\nStay Up Late frowned and immediately appeared in front of Yake. He punched towards that power and broke it.\n\n\u201cGood timing.\u201d Yake\u2019s geno armor unleashed more power, directed at Stay Up Late in the form of another punch.\n\nTwo powers collided against each other, generating a massive shockwave that broke the buildings all around. Yake deliberately placed the shockwave near their building.\n\n\u201cAs a crystallizer, you know this is against the law.\u201d Stay Up Late moved and destroyed the power unleashed at the building. He did not allow any of it to touch them.\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Yake punched again towards the building, continuing to say, \u201cSoldiers are nothing in this era. What is the point of war?\u201d\n\nStay Up Late punched Yake\u2019s power once again. He stared at Yake and said, \u201cTrue. The crystallizers are gone, and there are no more crystallizer soldiers and crystallizer laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good that you understand this. Join us. You will earn more than you did when you were a soldier.\u201d Yake continued to attack as he spoke.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter who I belong to, but you are the sort of person that I hate. So\u2026\u201d Stay Up Late looked at Yake coldly, and his armor began to shine. A light began to envelop his fist.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe scary power of his fist, like an erupting volcano, came down on Yake. Yake used both fists to fight back against it, but Stay Up Late was too strong and quickly whittled away Yake\u2019s defenses.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Yake screamed, as the volcanic power continued to mount. Eventually, his geno armor broke.\n\nPang!\n\nYake\u2019s body collapsed on the ground, forming a crater that was filled with blood.\n\nHe was struggling down in the earth, unable to get up. Yake looked at Stay Up Late and said, \u201cEnthusiastic rush. You are not a normal soldier. Are you from the Third Division Special Forces?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter. Leave this place and never come back. If the crystallizers weren\u2019t destroyed, you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Stay Up Late said coldly.\n\n\u201cHaha!\u201d Yake suddenly laughed. \u201cA member of the Third Division Special Forces, huh? That is interesting. When you see him, it will be fun.\u201d\n\nStay Up Late frowned and looked at Yake, as Yake spoke to the sky. \u201cOfficer, you aren\u2019t coming out? Are you simply going to watch us die? Or are you watching the power of the Special Force member killing me?\u201d\n\nStay Up Late\u2019s body shook, and he looked up to the sky. There, a shadow was slowly approaching. When he saw it, he looked at it in disbelief. He screamed, \u201cOfficer, you are not dead!\u201d"
