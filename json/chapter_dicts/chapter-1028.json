He thought the silver fox might have gone to the ghost fox\u2019s den, but Han Sen had no idea where that might have been. Since it was too dangerous for him to venture there in such a weak state of body, he didn\u2019t dare leave the shelter.\n\nAfter a period of rest and recovery, Han Sen found himself nearing full recuperation. But just as he was, he was alerted to the nearby presence of a swathe of angry creatures and spirits.\n\nThe leader was clad in black-iron armor, and he wielded a black-iron greatsword. He rode atop a lion, whose fur was also black.\n\nMany powerful creatures and spirits trailed behind him, as a wake.\n\nThey had come to the front of the shelter once before, but this was while Han Sen was back in the Alliance. The silver fox had been there at the time, and he managed to ward them off by incinerating a few.\n\nLearning a high number of creatures and spirits had come for them, Lin He and Lin Weiwei returned to the Alliance so they could fetch Han Sen.\n\nAfter returning to the sanctuary, Han Sen picked up Bao\u2019er and ascended one of the shelter\u2019s watchtowers. There, he used his Dongxuan Aura to measure the strength of those that sought to oppose him.\n\nAmongst the collective that had now gathered in front of the shelter, Han Sen espied the presence of a small sacred-blood creature that looked like a pigeon. This pleased him.\n\nSacred-blood creatures that were small in size were quite a rarity. He could finish that pigeon in one sitting, easy.\n\nThere were a few other sacred-blood creatures there as well, but they were too big and none tickled his fancy in particular. The second smallest was the black lion, but a preliminary examination suggested it would be inedible for him.\n\n\u201cContemptible humans; how dare you assault and claim my shelter for your own? Lay down your arms and submit to slavery and I will spare your lives. This is the only offer for such mercy you will receive,\u201d Ghost-Sword Prince coldly proclaimed.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do? Should we return to the Alliance?\u201d Zhao Xin\u2019s face seemed disturbed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; it\u2019s only a royal spirit.\u201d After that, Han Sen turned his head to address the spirit below. He said, \u201cHm, this seems rote. How about we spice things up with a duel? If you defeat me, then by all means, enslave us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Ghost-Sword Prince agreed.\n\nHan Sen had embarrassed him, directly in front of his father, no less. Killing them all in a crude siege would have been too simple for Ghost-Sword Prince, so a duel for the regaining of the honor he thought he had lost was a concept he rather enjoyed.\n\nGhost-Sword did not think much of humans. He thought they weren\u2019t very powerful, due to most of the human population being mere slaves in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. Humans had become slaves to the overwhelming strength of spirits all across the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, and humans of some renown were in very short supply. / update by\n\nLuo Haitang was a human of renown, but his time had come and gone.\n\nHan Sen drew his Taia sword and leapt down to the grassy fields below. He said, \u201cCome on, show me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nNo human could talk to him like that, or so he thought. Being addressed in such a boorish fashion enraged him, so he spared no time in trying to swing his black-iron greatsword down on Han Sen.\n\nIt was a geno weapon he wielded. It might not have had the glow or sheen that was typical of such weaponry, but it had a dark and imposing figure. The sword itself looked powerful and unbreakable.\n\nDong!\n\nHan Sen used his Blood-Pulse Sutra to perform a guard with Taia.\n\nThe force that came down on the sword was tremendous, and it knocked Han Sen back about ten feet. Still, Taia was left without a scratch.\n\n\u201cYou must have a death wish, to willingly fight one such as I.\u201d After Ghost-Sword Prince finished speaking, he lunged forward for another strike.\n\nHan Sen knew his power was weaker than the Prince\u2019s, who seemed reliant on the use of raw, physical damage. But since that was only one element of the fight, it didn\u2019t concern him.\n\nHan Sen could have used super king spirit mode, but he didn\u2019t want to. He thought it\u2019d be a waste of time and strength, using it on a foe he didn\u2019t deem worthy enough to be the recipient of its might.\n\nHan Sen used Aero and Double Fly, and attacked like a dive-bombing phoenix.\n\nSword-Ghost\u2019s power was no joke, and each strike could have proven fatal if they met with their target. Fortunately, Han Sen was able to dodge each and every one, using stealth to insert hits of his own.\n\nGhost-Sword Prince felt as if he was doing battle with the air. Try as he might, he only broke the sky\u2014he couldn\u2019t touch Han Sen!\n\nHan Sen was silent the entire time, though. He was focused right now, and he was in the zone, entirely concentrated on honing and improving the skills he employed to fight the spirit.\n\nIt was difficult to find an opponent that was of a similar level as him, but here one was. If Han Sen had to take a guess, he\u2019d assume the spirit had managed to unlock eight gene locks. He was nigh the perfect opponent to train and spar with.\n\n\u201cWeiwei, it looks like Han Sen can make use of both Heavenly Go and Seven Twist,\u201d Lin He said, correctly determining what moves Han Sen was making use of.\n\nLin Weiwei nodded, saying, \u201cHe learned Heavenly Go from Queen. As for Seven Twist, I have no idea where he learned that or from whom.\u201d\n\nLin He, as he continued to watch, said, \u201cLittle Han is quite a talented young chap. Even though he has opened one gene lock less than the spirit he battles with, he can keep up just fine and surpass his opponent. Han Sen is clearly winning. He really is the best of the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did that fox go, I wonder?\u201d Lin Weiwei was worried about Ghost-Sword Prince not keeping to his promise if Han Sen won the fight. If the creatures in his command still attacked, she thought the fox would be of great service to them.\n\n\u201cThe fox isn\u2019t here, and if that spirit does not stay true to his word and attacks us anyway, I\u2019m not entirely sure we can hold this place.\u201d Chen Hu had the same worry.\n\nAnd just as Chen Hu said this, Ghost-Sword Prince commanded his followers to commence an attack on the shelter."
