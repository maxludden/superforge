    "text": "\u201cYou don\u2019t look like someone who would become a traitor. Can you tell me more about your past?\u201d Han Sen asked with a look of great curiosity. He was still sitting behind Lando on the Tianxia Unicorn as they made their way out of the system.\n\nHe thought there had to be more to the story of Lando slaying his teacher. With Lando\u2019s power, assassinating a deified would have been incredibly difficult.\n\nPlus, there shouldn\u2019t have been a reason for him to kill his own mentor. By doing so, he only would have gained the animosity of his own race and the distrust of others. There was no benefit.\n\n\u201cYou are wrong. I really am a traitor that killed his teacher,\u201d Lando said emotionlessly.\n\n\u201cCan you tell me why?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nLando hesitated. Han Sen noticed and quickly said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you would kill your teacher for no reason. But if you don\u2019t want to tell me about it, that\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t push.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s strategy of backing off the subject worked. Although it took Lando some time to respond, he eventually said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to keep the story a secret. It\u2019s just that if I told people, they wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would believe you,\u201d Han Sen said with certainty.\n\n\u201cIf I told you I was my teacher, would you believe it?\u201d Lando asked, turning around to stare into Han Sen\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not sure what to make of that statement. What do you mean?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nLando faced forward again. They continued to fly forward for a long, quiet moment.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s curiosity was amped up even more. He was afraid that Lando might refuse to discuss the subject any further, but fortunately, Lando again broke the silence. \u201cYou saw the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo on my back, did you not? You know what that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Han Sen shook his head. \u201cIsn\u2019t that some kind of treasure?\u201d\n\nLando explained the basics of what the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was and how it worked. Then he said, \u201cPeople think my master worked hard for 10,000 years to obtain that Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. But that isn\u2019t what happened at all. He found an easier way.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing this, Han Sen felt a shiver pass through him. He had an intuition about where this story was going.\n\nLando went on to say, \u201cHe tried it before, but the pain was too much for even a deified being to endure. It wasn\u2019t long before he gave up on the idea, but he really wanted Dragon One\u2019s position, and he needed more power in order to claim it. So, he came up with a plan. And that is why I\u2019m here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to be successfully created and wielded, the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo needed a body as a base. But Dragon Two found a way to circumvent the need to endure that pain. He used his genes to create a duplicate of himself. Then he set that clone to practicing with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. When the process was complete, he planned to take the tattoo for himself. Because the clone had been created from his own genes, there wouldn\u2019t have been any compatibility issues. It would have been just like he had practiced with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means that the person who suffered for 10,000 years was you?\u201d Han Sen demanded angrily.\n\nLando nodded. \u201cBecause I was merely cloned from his genes, I didn\u2019t possess deified powers. Before I could practice with the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo, I had to achieve King class powers at the very least. So, he let me start practicing. And to prevent the chance of there being compatibility issues further down the line, I learned all the same skills that he had learned in his youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just a genetic clone. I didn\u2019t have memories, and I couldn\u2019t think for myself. I was like a baby. I only had the knowledge, thought processes, and powers that I was given. Other Dragons believed that I was his student. And his favorite student, at that. People thought he treated me like a son and gave me everything. He taught me many secret skills, but no one knew he did that for the sole purpose of replicating himself within me. If he hadn\u2019t trained me exactly the way he had been trained, he thought there might be issues when he tried to harvest the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo.\u201d\n\nHan Sen\u2019s heart sank as he listened. A deified elite had created and brainwashed a baby, all so he could inflict unimaginable pain on the child to further his own power.\n\nLando probably hadn\u2019t even fully understood why he was suffering.\n\n\u201cIf you were a clone, you guys must have looked identical. Did no one else notice that?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nLando smiled, and that smile was chilling. \u201cChanging one\u2019s appearance isn\u2019t difficult. You just need to change a small number of your genes. For a deified, such a task is easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he thought, at least. He made a tiny change to my genes, just enough to alter my appearance. However, he never expected that this minor difference would end up changing everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough I was his clone, the environment I was raised in was different than Dragon Two\u2019s childhood. As the years went by, the tiny change he made to my genes was compounded by the differences in environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a shame I didn\u2019t know anything about this back then. I thought I was his student, someone that he treated like his real son. I just wanted to show gratitude for what he had done for me. I wanted to finish the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. No matter the pain I suffered, I forced myself to endure it. I pushed myself so hard that I lost all feeling in my body.\u201d After saying that, Lando laughed. But Han Sen could tell that the laugh was forced. It was Lando\u2019s way of showing that he wasn\u2019t afraid of what had happened anymore.\n\nLando trailed off. Han Sen could guess what had happened next. Dragon Two must have revealed his scheme as Lando practiced the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. Lando must have fought with him, and that was why Dragon Two had died.\n\nBut Han Sen still didn\u2019t understand how Lando managed to kill Dragon Two. Even if he was Dragon Two\u2019s genetic clone, he didn\u2019t have Dragon Two\u2019s deified power.\n\nLando seemed to notice Han Sen\u2019s unspoken question. He shook his head and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking. I didn\u2019t fight him. We transferred the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo to him, and he couldn\u2019t wait to practice and push the tattoo to the final stage. The process went smoothly, just as he expected. The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo came entirely under his control, and he used his own blood to refine it. The blend was a success, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any problems. Then, once the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo reached deified class, he discovered that the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo had a very strong compatibility issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine a man who has just had a heart transplant discovered that there was a compatibility issue. He went insane. He had already used more than half of his blood to push the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo to deified status. The Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo was to be stronger than himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, he died. And you took back the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo. Why were you labeled a traitor?\u201d Han Sen still didn\u2019t understand.\n\nLando quietly said, \u201cIn the end, he couldn\u2019t handle the thought of his impending death. He tried to take my body, hoping that he could use my body to survive and regain control over the Demon Hell Dragon Tattoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this story,\u201d Han Sen said with a sigh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either,\u201d Lando said.\n\nHan Sen wanted to say something more, but something suddenly appeared in front of them. It came right toward Han Sen before he even had a chance to react.\n\n\u201cA deified Demon?\u201d When Han Sen got close enough to see the body clearly, he raised his eyebrows."
