    "text": "\u201cWhere is Icebird Duke?\u201d Yisha asked Han Sen as they stood on the Knife Battleship.\n\n\u201cQueen, I do not know where Icebird Duke is.\u201d Han Sen gave her a wry smile. He wasn\u2019t planning on admitting anything. Plus, no one had survived on that planet, and they were all trapped in Purgatory Heaven. As long as he did not admit what had happened, no evidence would be unearthed to suggest otherwise.\n\n\u201cHow can you not know? Icebird Duke should have been by your side at all times, protecting you!\u201d Yisha spoke to him calmly, but Han Sen could detect what was really boiling beneath the surface. If he gave her the wrong answer, God only knew what would happen.\n\nHan Sen did not hesitate to tell her, \u201cIcebird Duke and I went to Planet Crooked Rock. I wanted to see if I could recruit a few of the Gana, but when I arrived, I realized I had no chance. So, I asked her to help me recruit. But then, the Kao revolted. They put the Gana on auction. We were invited, so Icebird Duke went ahead to the auction. With someone else to recruit on my behalf, I didn\u2019t bother going.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Yisha asked.\n\n\u201cAnd then I recruited them. Before we got back to the ship, the entire planet was veiled by gold clouds. And there were many arms coming out of the ground, alongside many beasts that crawled out of some nether. We tried to hide in a cave, and we fought those monsters side-by-side! After a day of this, the beasts, arms, and clouds disappeared. When we got back to the ship, we noticed Icebird Duke was gone, and so were many others! Everyone else on the entire planet was gone too.\u201d\n\nHan Sen cooked up a hearty mixture of lies and truths to sell the story. He had to keep running with this yarn, whether or not Yisha believed him.\n\nYisha looked at Han Sen, Han Meng\u2019er, Dragon Lady, Wang Yuhang, and then looked back to Han Sen. \u201cHow did you deal with those creatures and the arms?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose arms were scary! Our powers didn\u2019t do anything. If we were grabbed, we\u2019d be pulled into the ground. The beasts were even scarier! Our powers did nothing to hinder their assault. Only Spell and Meng\u2019er were able to fight them,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cYou are saying that Spell and her powers can defeat the Purgatory Beasts?\u201d Yisha asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cYes, but they can\u2019t deal with the arms. But we survived because of this item. It enabled us to shred the arms.\u201d Han Sen presented her with his Knife Blank, showing it off.\n\nYisha took the Knife Blank and gave it a stroke with her fingers. She released some sort of purple power onto the Knife Blank, but the power could not be absorbed.\n\nYisha looked shocked, and she said, \u201cThis Knife Blank is godly! It is no wonder it could cut through those hell hands.\u201d \u201cWith the god element, does that mean it is a deified item?\u201d Han Sen was happy to hear this.\n\nYisha shook her head and said, \u201cIt is not a deified item. It is just a material for a deified item.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is great! I can forge it into an item of some sort, then, yes? You should take this knife, my queen. You should forge it into a godly knife, and make it something properly deified. And then, you can shock the whole universe!\u201d Han Sen said quickly.\n\nYou are willing to give this to me?\u201d Yisha smiled at Han Sen, as she held onto the Knife Blank.\n\n\u201cOf course! You are my master, after all. Your glory is my glory. If you achieve more, I would be even more proud. This is just a meager Knife Blank. If I had a deified knife, I\u2019d give that to you first. If your life is getting better, then my life is sure to improve, too.\u201d Han Sen looked awfully sincere.\n\nYisha looked much nicer now, but she gave it back to Han Sen. \u201cYou are nice, but this Knife Blank was obtained in the Knife Grave. It\u2019ll be difficult to forge it, and it isn\u2019t too godly. I can\u2019t make it into something powerful, I am afraid.\u201d\n\nAfter a pause, Yisha continued speaking to Han Sen. \u201cI will ask someone else to escort you to Planet Eclipse. I am going to Planet Crooked Rock, where I hope to find a lead on the whereabouts of Icebird Duke. I will avenge and destroy any who has done something bad to Icebird.\u201d\n\n\u201cIcebird Duke was put in danger because of me. I should go with you,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. And by the way, don\u2019t tell others you have been to Planet Crooked Rock. That will bring unnecessary hassle. It\u2019d be bad.\u201d After a brief talk with Han Sen, Yisha sent him on his way to Narrow Moon. She went ahead to Planet Crooked Rock.\n\nHan Sen felt a lot of relief when he was back. Somehow, he had made it through. Even if she did not believe him entirely, he should remain safe as long as she was not able to find any evidence that contradicted his story.\n\nHan Sen brought his companions into the base. Then he gave Wang Yuhang a truckload of xenogeneic genes, wanting him to get stronger and generate a geno armor.\n\nAlthough there was a Marquise class armor, Han Sen was worried that the man was so weak that he\u2019d end up getting killed anyway.\n\nHan Sen had nothing but Baron class xenogeneic genes, but that was fine for Wang Yuhang. And after a few days, Wang Yuhang\u2019s xenogeneic gene tally reached one hundred.\n\nWang Yuhang started to evolve, and he ended up generating a black geno armor.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t evolve a second time, so Han Sen gave him a Magnet Fruit. He made it and became a fully-fledged Baron.\n\n\u201cLittle Uncle! Your geno armament is cool.\u201d Han Sen looked at Wang Yuhang\u2019s geno armament in surprise.\n\nWang Yuhang\u2019s geno armament was a black dirt bike. It looked like a vintage model, but it looked sweet.\n\n\u201cHaha! I knew I was born a special chap. It looks pretty bad*ss, huh? If you need anything, I got your back.\u201d Wang Yuhang looked so cocky, sitting on his new bike.\n\n\u201cWhat powers does it have?\u201d Han Sen asked with curiosity,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d Wang Yuhang said, then started the bike. He drove around the base and returned to Han Sen. He proudly said, \u201cWhat do you think? Fast? Powerful?\u201d\n\nThe speed is okay, but what else does it do, aside from carry you?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cI can run over people!\u201d Wang Yuhang sounded a bit weak.\n\n\u201cSo it deals no damage. Does it have any other function? Like, can it fly? Can it carry you across water?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cBro, this is a bike! You are talking about boats and planes.\u201d Wang Yuhang laughed.\n\nHan Sen felt his heart sink. This bike was like any other he could buy. It could drive him around and little else."
