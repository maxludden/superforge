    "text": "Seeing the beautiful Lady Snake coming toward him, Old Cat thought through many different options very quickly. He couldn\u2019t think of a way to get out of the predicament, though.\n\n\u201cBrother Han, didn\u2019t you say we should find a way to get rid of her? I have an idea\u2026\u201d Old Cat said to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen and Xie Qing King laughed and said, \u201cSorry! We\u2019ve changed our minds now. You are right, living is more important.\n\nWe\u2019ll run while you deal with her.\u201d\n\nLady Snake came close and ran into Old Cat a number of times. Then, Old Cat raised his paws and started to scratch the creature. He was so quick, though, Han Sen couldn\u2019t even see him do it.\n\nAt that close distance, Lady Snake saw the movements. Her hands that were covered by scales came into contact with the cat\u2019s paws.\n\nBoom!\n\nA scary power blew a big hole in the earth. The dust and soil scattered everywhere, prompting Han Sen and Xie Qing King to take off running.\n\nThe scary power kept on appearing behind them, driving Han Sen on in fear.\n\nAnd this time, they were really running forward. They were no longer looping. Before long, they were at the outskirts of the ruins. They made it outside.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary to be a habitat for such extraordinarily strong beings. Not even emperors could fight them,\u201d Xie Qing King said, as he felt the earth rock and shake.\n\n\u201cEmperors are nothing to them.\u201d Han Sen stood outside the ruins. It was so dark in there, but you could still see the powers wreaking havoc. There were only two creatures fighting down there, but you could immediately tell it was a bad battle.\n\n\u201cAre we really going to just leave the cat?\u201d Xie Qing King asked.\n\n\u201cWith the power we have, we can\u2019t help.\u201d After Han Sen said that, he heard a cat start to squeal. Then a scary power swiftly began heading out of the hollow.\n\n\u201cOh, no! Old Cat couldn\u2019t fight her. They are coming this way. Run!\u201d Han Sen shouted, and the two ran away at an even faster pace.\n\nBefore Old Cat could get to them, though, Lady Snake caught up to him and he was re-engaged in combat.\n\nAs Old Cat fought, he squealed, \u201cIdiot! You think I can\u2019t fight you? If it wasn\u2019t for the rules, you\u2019d be dead already. You better run while you still have the chance. If you make the cat angry, I\u2019ll cook you alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Cat\u2019s still spouting that egotistical crap?\u201d Han Sen thought to himself, but he didn\u2019t allow his legs to slow or stop. Suddenly, though, he felt something hot on his back. The heat increased until it burned.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t very happy about that. If something was now happening to his tattoo, then it wasn\u2019t a good sign.\n\nHan Sen turned his head and looked. The shadow of a red cat started to cover the ground, and it looked very oppressive and scary. It covered the entire area around them.\n\nHan Sen was frozen, and the cat\u2019s shadow gave him a fright-and-a-half. It made Han Sen feel as if he was as small as an ant.\n\nThe burning feeling of the Nine-Life Cat on his back was because of that. Old Cat\u2019s transformation had triggered the reaction of his tattoo.\n\nOld Cat did not have time to be tricky, and he looked like a beast as he tore off the arms of Lady Snake.\n\nLady Snake immediately experienced immense pain, and she quickly wished to run away. But Old Cat was swift to break open her chest and pull out her beating heart.\n\n\u201cD*mn thing! You ruined the cat\u2019s business. Now you die!\u201d Old Cat screamed aloud, as he raised his claws to the sky.\n\nLady Snake was then ripped to pieces, and not a complete bone remained. Her blood was spilled everywhere, and Han Sen and Xie Qing King were put into a state of shock.\n\n\u201cThe cat is that strong?\u201d Xie Qing King\u2019s eyes opened wide.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything. Old Cat was strong, but his back was still burning and that worried him.\n\nOld Cat killed Lady Snake, and before anything else could happen, the sky started to change. A black sun appeared above them, expanding in size.\n\nIt was like a whirling black hole, getting bigger in the sky. And as it grew bigger, a force of suction started to manifest.\n\nThe scary Old Cat could not withstand the might of that suction power, and he was pulled towards the Black Hole. He used his claws to dig into the ground and fight it, but his attempts proved useless. The claws created drag marks that were a few miles long, but his body was still being pulled without reprieve.\n\nThe suction did not seem to affect anything else. Not even the trees near Old Cat were swayed more than average, and it seemed only Old Cat was affected.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as if nothing else could feel the suction, and by now, Han Sen\u2019s Nine-Life Cat tattoo was shining red. He felt the suction then, and he started flying towards it like a magnet.\n\nHan Sen hugged the nearest tree to him, but the tree was pulled out by the force, unable to stop him from flying into the vortex.\n\nXie Qing King wished to help Han Sen, but Han Sen waved him off. If it could suck up Old Cat, then Xie Qing King would definitely have been pulled in.\n\n\u201cTell everyone I will find a way back. Tell them to be careful\u2026\u201d Before Han Sen could finish his speech, he was sucked into the black hole.\n\nOld Cat was squealing all the way, but he could not resist the force. He was eventually sucked in, as well. They were gone.\n\nThe black hole, as if it had finished its mission following the acquisition of Old Cat, disappeared. And then, the lands returned to normal.\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had been thrown into a washing machine. He kept getting rolled around, and he had no idea how long it took before the motion stopped.\n\nPang!\n\nHan Sen felt as if he had just been rudely thrown off his bed out of deep slumber. He felt great pain, enough to make it feel as if his bones were going to snap."
