    "text": "Han Sen looked at Han Yufei as he said, \u201cIf you are willing to explain, then I should be able to understand.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei was non-committal. She coldly said, \u201cAside from Ancient God and God Spirits, the universe\u2019s creatures have a mortal life. Do you know what determines their lifespan?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought about it and said, \u201cDifferent creatures all have different lengths of life. That is usually determined by their genes.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei nodded. \u201cIndeed, unless they die by accident. Otherwise, what affects their lifespan is usually down to what is in their genes. Different creatures have different genes that determine the length of their life. But that is not something absolute. In fact, many other variables can affect a lifespan. For example, there is cryosleep technology in the universe. That is very common. It can slow down the renewal of genes and extend one\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cCryosleep technology is a stupid idea. When you are frozen, it is like you are dead. In the meantime, it is totally pointless. Compared to that, there are high-class time geno arts that can make your body clock stop so the genes in your body never renew. Technically, you would be immortal and forever young.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like you.\u201d Han Sen looked at Han Yufei as he spoke. Han Yufei had been trapped in Two Worlds Mountain for god knows how many billions of years, yet she had maintained a youthful image. She had not died. That must have been a result of time powers.\n\nHan Yufei did not answer Han Sen. She went on to say, \u201cAccording to the theory, many creatures can be immortal. In fact, it is not like that. No matter if normal creatures or true god xenogeneics have a powerful time power, if they live longer than their gene\u2019s lifespan, they will die by accident. Before Sacred appeared, that was very common. Powerful existences, such as true dragons or phoenixes, no matter how powerful they are or how strong their lifeforce, will die at some point in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying that the God Spirits take the lifespan of creatures?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s head flashed. He thought about the God Spirits stealing one\u2019s lifespan.\n\nHan Yufei nodded and said, \u201cYes. It is like that. When Sacred appeared, they forced open the space barrier. They forced the god palaces to appear and killed god knows how many of the God Spirits that descended. The god palaces were heavily damaged. After I was set free, I saw many old antiques that remained alive. Some even hailed from Sacred\u2019s time. With their current lifespan, they cannot live much longer. The only explanation is that because of Sacred\u2019s god fights, there was a flaw in the God Spirit\u2019s control. That is how they were able to use all methods to live up until now. Before Sacred, this had never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean killing God Spirits is to obtain immortality?\u201d Han Sen frowned.\n\nAlthough what Han Yufei was saying made sense, Han Sen still thought there was something amiss.\n\n\u201cImmortality, to me, isn\u2019t what I am looking for, but I don\u2019t like the feeling of being restricted and calculated. How long I live is something I should determine. After all, it is my life. The God Spirits are trying to take those rights away. I am not going to allow them to succeed. I want them to feel what it feels like to have their lives in the hands of others.\u201d Han Yufei used her hands to lift her black-framed glasses as she spoke.\n\n\u201cThis woman\u2026 She is insane\u2026\u201d Han Sen had to admit Han Yufei was the scariest woman he had ever met.\n\nHan Sen suddenly remembered the scroll. Han Yufei\u2019s crime was committing blasphemy against a God Spirit. Her crime was worse than God\u2019s Retribution. Now, it was starting to make sense.\n\nHan Sen was pretty sure that in the Sacred era, she must have conducted tests on the God Spirits. That was probably a crime that was worse than slaying a God Spirit.\n\nHan Sen stared at Han Yufei as he asked, \u201cWhat about Sacred Leader? Did he kill gods because of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what he told me, but I do not think that is the real reason. At the very least, he did not do it just for himself. He was probably doing it for someone else.\u201d After saying that, Han Yufei went silent.\n\n\u201cWan\u2019er?\u201d Han Sen said the name and watched Han Yufei\u2019s reaction.\n\nHan Yufei looked shocked. She asked, \u201cDo you know Wan\u2019er?\u201d\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cMore than just know her.\u201d\n\nHan Yufei did not wait for Han Sen\u2019s answer. She kept speaking. \u201cYes, that was who Sacred Leader loved the most. Sacred Leader\u2019s reason for killing the gods was probably because of Wan\u2019er. Otherwise, with his power, avoiding God Spirits to live would not have been difficult.\u201d\n\nHan Sen noticed Han Yufei\u2019s tone was a bit off. He quickly asked, \u201cWas Wander Sacred Leader\u2019s real sister?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough Sacred Leader kept saying Wan\u2019er was his real sister, I know for sure that Wan\u2019er was not his real sister because Wan\u2019er was not the same race as him,\u201d Han Yufei said with certainty. \u201cHow do you know they are not from the same race?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cOf course, Wan\u2019er was one of my people.\u201d Han Yufei lifted her lips as she spoke. \u201cWith the title, she should be calling me auntie. I watched her grow up. Do you think I am wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Wan\u2019er is the same race as you? What race do you belong to?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide as he looked at Han Yufei. Even now, he did not know which race Han Yufei belonged\n\nto.\n\n\u201cWitch,\u201d Han Yufei said with a sigh. \u201cOur race almost became extinct a long, long time ago. I don\u2019t think anyone in this universe has heard our name before. Aside from me, I do not believe any others are alive. Back then, there were Tai Yi, Qing Jun, and Purple Fight. Now, they are\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTai Yi? Qing Jun? Purple Fight? Are they all witches?\u201d Han Sen\u2019s eyes opened wide.\n\nHan Yufei developed a wry smile. \u201cNot anymore. Qing Jun has become Sky God. He is not a Witch anymore. Purple Fight is dead. The Purple Fight in Two Worlds Mountain was just his will. As for Tai Yi, he is missing. I am afraid he might have been killed in the god fights.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing this, Han Sen felt extremely weird. He had not expected Wan\u2019er and Han Yufei to come from the same race or to learn that Qing Jun and Tai Yi were once a Witch.\n\nAfter the god palaces appeared, Han Sen had been looking for Qing Jun\u2019s god temple. He wanted to kill him so that he could exact vengeance. He had searched the entire length of the god palaces and was unable to locate Qing Jun\u2019s flag. He did not know which god temple he resided within.\n\nRegarding Tai Yi and the Metal God Temple, Han Sen was not able to find it. That made Han Sen feel strange.\n\nHan Sen told her about his encounter with Tai Yi and how he repaired the Metal God Temple, broke space, and departed. He wanted to know what she might say. After Han Yufei heard that, she looked shocked. She asked, \u201cIs Tai Yi still alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but he fixed Metal God Temple and broke space,\u201d Han Sen said. \u201cI have not seen Metal God Temple amidst the others since the god palaces appeared. What is that all about?\u201d Han Yufei laughed. \u201cOf course, you were unable to find it. The Metal God Temple is the god temple Sacred tried to recreate. He wanted to replace the original god temple to become the leader of the universe so they would not be restricted by the god palaces and geno hall. They wanted to replace the entirety of the god palaces. Before they could succeed, Sacred was destroyed, and Metal God Temple was ruined. I did not know Tai Yi rebooted Metal God Temple.\u201d\n\nHan Sen wanted to say something, but he felt the entire laboratory start to shake. The ice walls were breaking. Even the metal was breaking. It was like there was an earthquake.\n\nSome scary presence covered the entire place. Even with Han Sen\u2019s slowed reaction, he sensed how scary it was."
