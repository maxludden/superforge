There were no hindrances, and Han Sen was able to withstand the high-energy blood he was given.\n\nAfter fifteen days, Han Sen became what could be considered a beginner. The energy in his blood, by this point, had doubled. Han Sen now had the time to enter the sanctuary and get to refining both Life Geno Essences.\n\nBai Yishan had been satisfied by the results thus far, and when Han Sen got even better, he would document his experiences with the skill for information data.\n\nOf course, his experience was only one of the many things required, so it wasn\u2019t enough to complete the project to a degree of satisfaction. Bai Yishan found Han Sen to ask him questions and learn whether or not problems with the hyper geno art came from the heart. If so, they could make the necessary changes.\n\nOrdinary people could not practice Heresy Mantra, but there were other hyper geno arts out there that could strengthen the heart. These were, however, not half as efficient.\n\nHan Sen had learned a lot from his time practicing Hidden Blood. In the past, Bai Yishan had only given Han Sen information that could be found on Skynet. But now that Han Sen could learn it right there with him, it was great. Plus, spending time in the labs allowed Han Sen to observe a variety of different experiments conducted by researchers.\n\nThere were hundreds of people there, running countless experiments at the same time. Bai Yishan was in charge of Hidden Blood because it was his own personal project; other projects were handled by those under his employ.\n\nHan Sen was captivated by the experiments, and on this day in particular, he lost track of time and missed his dinner. Fortunately for him, there was a vending machine there. He bought a snack and sat down to eat in the canteen.\n\nEver since he had learned the stomach hyper geno art, he had had to eat a lot more.\n\nWhile Han Sen ate, a group of other people entered the canteen.\n\nIt was past supper time, but still they came. One of the group was laughing loudly, and when he saw Han Sen, he stopped. The others, seeing him stop so suddenly, looked in the direction he had frozen. And then, they too saw Han Sen there.\n\nHan Sen glanced up and noticed it was Wang Lin. It was the person Han Sen had humiliated, back when they were on the Xue family\u2019s original planet.\n\nHan Sen continued eating, ignoring the man. He was friends with Wang Mengmeng and Wang Yuhang, so he wasn\u2019t too keen on keeping a rivalry with someone in their family.\n\nWang Lin went back to talking with the people who were accompanying him. Unfortunately for him, Han Sen\u2019s ears were far too good. He could hear every single word that was spoken.\n\nWang Lin told the story of what had transpired at the Xue family meeting, but reversed their roles entirely. Han Sen had mocked Wang Lin, saying he was a disgrace of a student for Professor Li, too, but Wang Lin had just said he was only insulting Professor Li, and he had stepped in to defend his teacher.\n\nLi Singhua was there in the canteen with them, and although Han Sen had never seen him before, he knew who it was. The way he stood out from the others in the group was plain to see.\n\nHis strength did not matter, though. This was the Saint Hall, and he could not freely attack Han Sen if he believed his student\u2019s words and wished to do so.\n\nThe researchers, hearing what Wang Lin said, all looked at Han Sen with anger.\n\nHan Sen did not blame them, though. He\u2019d be angry if he learned others had been insulting Bai Yishan.\n\nOne of the angry researchers approached Han Sen.\n\n\u201cDid you say Professor Li has no clue how to teach students?\u201d The man asked.\n\nHan Sen could not deny he said this, because he did, all for the purpose of mocking Wang Lin who had verbally assaulted Han Sen first.\n\nIf they were there, though, everyone would know Han Sen meant no ill sentiments toward Professor Li. After hearing what Wang Lin had told them, though, they obviously favored believing their colleague.\n\n\u201cI did say that,\u201d Han Sen admitted.\n\nThe researcher looked furious, and he said, \u201cApologize immediately! If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t hold it against me for what I do next.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one of his students can beat me and prove me wrong, sure. I\u2019ll apologize,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cHow? Through a fight? I thought you were disabled.\u201d The man seemed shocked, hearing the suggestion.\n\nHan Sen merely smiled and said, \u201cWe are researchers; he didn\u2019t teach you to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what are you suggesting? How would we compete?\u201d the man asked, frowning.\n\nEveryone researched different subjects, so it was difficult to find common ground. It wouldn\u2019t be fair for Han Sen to suggest something he had already studied.\n\nHan Sen smiled and walked before Li Singhua.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, what are you doing?\u201d the researcher said, stepping between the two.\n\nHan Sen bowed to Li Singhua, saying, \u201cProfessor Li, why don\u2019t you suggest a research topic we can research together. I lose if they are faster, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nEveryone thought Han Sen was crazy. Different researchers were good at different things, so if Li Singhua suggested something Han Sen didn\u2019t know squat about, he\u2019d immediately be at a disadvantage.\n\nLi Singhua was their teacher. If he suggested a topic his students already knew, then Han Sen would also lose.\n\nLi Singhua smiled and said, \u201cBai Yishan does have a good student.\u201d"
