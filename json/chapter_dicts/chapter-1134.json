Where did they go and what did they find?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe met God\u2026 Well, more like a demon.\u201d Uncle Bug looked as if he was in pain, in remembrance.\n\nHan Sen just watched Uncle Bug, allowing him as much time as he needed to explain.\n\nUncle Bug, after a long pause, said, \u201cI was an Interstellar Pirate. I came into possession of a Qi Gong, and after practicing it, I became incredibly strong. Through strength came wealth, and I became rich.\u201d\n\nHe stopped and sighed for a moment before proceeding. \u201cPerhaps it was karma, and God decided to punish my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter my wife died, Little Yan received the same disease that had taken her away from me. In my desperation, the Alliance found me. They wished for me to join the Seventh Team and conduct research. In return, they were willing to give Little Yan the best medical care they could, and have only the best doctors attend to his failing health. As you can imagine, I didn\u2019t think twice about agreeing.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Uncle Bug\u2019s face was drawn with confusion. He muttered to say, \u201cI thought it was very dangerous, but after teleporting, it was like heaven. I had everything I could ever want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was this place?\u201d Han Sen asked, unable to even comprehend what the team had experienced.\n\n\u201cIt defies words, son. I don\u2019t even know how I could explain it.\u201d Uncle Bug knew such a description could not suffice, and it could not possibly satiate Han Sen\u2019s thirst for knowledge, so he tried. \u201cIt was a realm controlled by a demon. It was like an ever-changing canvas that morphed to his desire. If he wanted a mountain, he\u2019d have a mountain. If he wanted water, he could birth an endless sea. If he wanted women, there they\u2019d be. It was only natural to assume we had met God, the creator, the maker.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug\u2019s face was then taken by pain and sorrow. He said, \u201cIf I had not made that wish, Little Yan would not have had to suffer all those bitter, horrible years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the demon look like?\u201d Han Sen tried to take his mind off the subject of his son.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to say, but I believe it was a man. It was masculine, in some way. I don\u2019t think it had a fixed appearance, as it was different for each of us. When I asked Old Han, he told me this demon was but a mere old man. Sunset told us it was a beautiful woman. It was in front of us, in the same spot, but it appeared as a different form for the each of us.\u201d\n\nHan Sen frowned and asked, \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe demon told us it\u2019d give us a test. If we were successful, it\u2019d grant us one wish. I believed him to be God, a benevolent being of grand magnificence. The fool I was. I accepted the test, as who could turn down a free wish? Old Han tried to convince us to not accept, but none of us listened,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\n\u201cDid everyone else accept this test?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nUncle Bug said, \u201cThere were only two people who rejected the offer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne was Han Jinzhi; who was the other?\u201d Han Sen was surprised to hear someone else had rejected an offer from God.\n\n\u201cNo, Old Han accepted the challenge,\u201d Uncle Bug revealed, as he shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhat?! He did?\u201d Han Sen exclaimed.\n\nHan Sen believed he hadn\u2019t, which was why he thought Sunset had told him that Han Jinzhi had humiliated God.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he made a wish, but he did take the test,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\n\u201cThen who didn\u2019t take the test?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nUncle Bug said, \u201cOne person\u2019s surname was Ning. He was good friends with Old Han, and Old Han was always called him Brother Ning. I am not sure what his full name was, to tell you the truth. But Old Han told him something, and that was why he did not accept the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas Brother Ning from the Ning family in Starry Group?\u201d Han Sen did not know there was a person with the surname Ning in the Seventh Team. But if there was, then it had to have been from that Ning family.\n\nUncle Bug shook his head, admitting, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, and who was the other person?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cIt was a very beautiful woman.\u201d Uncle Bug\u2019s mood brightened when he spoke of her.\n\nHan Sen stared at Uncle Bug.\n\nUncle Bug explained, \u201cWhen I was an Interstellar Pirate, I took refuge on a barren planet. I didn\u2019t know much about the Alliance back then, I only knew about the mega-corporations. When I was in the Seventh Team, everyone used their titles instead of their real names. Aside from Sunset and Old Han, I did not know much about the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe woman was on the Seventh Team, but she was very careful to reveal nothing about her background. No one introduced her, and I did not even know her title. All I know is that she was the prettiest and most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on, even to this day.\u201d\n\nHan Sen looked at Uncle Bug and asked, \u201cAfter you finished the test, what wish did you make? And what wish did Han Jinzhi make?\u201d\n\nUncle Bug said, \u201cI do not know what the others wished.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug went on to say, \u201cAfter the test began, I was sent to a place on my lonesome. When I was done, all I saw was that demon. I could not see the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I made a wish to the demon, he gave me a drop of blood. He told me to give it to Little Yan and then bring Little Yan to it. He told me he could live with creatures, and the sickness would no longer harm him.\u201d Uncle Bug began to shed tears.\n\nHan Sen could guess what happened next, and the information he was currently receiving was not elucidating the mysteries he wished to have explained.\n\n\u201cUncle Bug, how did you know I have the Nine-Life Cat pendant?\u201d Han Sen knew there was information he could gather, so he shifted the subject to ask this."
