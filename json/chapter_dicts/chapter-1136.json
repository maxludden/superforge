He was quite surprised.\n\nHe thought he had received another copy of the Blood-Pulse Sutra, and that was what Uncle Bug had found all those years ago. This was actually a different Qi Gong, and it was called Life Door.\n\nLife Door was a supportive Qi Gong; something to strengthen a person\u2019s inner body.\n\nIt was not too dissimilar to Heresy Mantra or Hidden Blood, in concept. Life Door, however, did not apply to a single organ. It strengthened a door inside a person\u2019s body; one that was called the Life Door.\n\nThe scroll said that to practice Life Door would enhance your entire body.\n\nBut to complete Life Door, you would have to reach a certain level.\n\nHan Sen tried practicing Life Door, and after spending a few days with it, his body already felt better. Still, he knew it\u2019d take far longer than that to open the Life Door itself.\n\nUncle Bug told Han Sen it took him twenty years to open his Life Door. Han Sen was far stronger than he was, and even though he knew it wouldn\u2019t take that long, it wasn\u2019t something he could get done in a few days.\n\nA few days later, Moment Queen had successfully moved the underground shelter nearby. After entering, Han Sen was able to see Zero again.\n\nAlthough Zero could teleport to Han Sen, he wanted her to remain in the underground shelter to care for the Flying Mushroom. After all that time had elapsed, the Flying Mushroom had matured. With it ready for consumption, Han Sen was eager to return to the underground shelter just for it.\n\nIt had the ability to turn ordinary spirits into king spirits, but Han Sen didn\u2019t want the mushroom to be too ripe.\n\nBack in that shelter, he looked at the spirits he had come to possess and summoned Thorn Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d Han Sen told her, while indicating to the Flying Mushroom.\n\nThorn Baron looked delightfully surprised, and she gasped. She politely double-checked, asking, \u201cAre you sure you really want me to use it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you are the best available candidate,\u201d Han Sen replied.\n\nThorn Baron\u2019s bloodline had a king spirit in its ranks, so her success rate would be higher.\n\nAfter giving Han Sen a weirded-out look, Thorn Baron bit into the Flying Mushroom.\n\nWhen it was eaten, the Flying Mushroom turned into a delectable nectar. And as she gorged on it, her body began to glow. She said, \u201cTake me back to the Sea of Soul. I\u2019m going to evolve!\u201d\n\nHan Sen placed Thorn Baron back as instructed. She glowed more and more, becoming brighter and brighter. In a short time, she had become so bright, she was nothing more than a blob of pure radiance. Her form could no longer be distinguished.\n\n\u201cI hope she makes it soon, too. If she finishes up sometime soon, I\u2019ll have yet another beautiful fighter by my side.\u201d Han Sen was thinking about Little Angel, and gave her a look. He wondered when she\u2019d finish evolving.\n\nHan Sen had absorbed a lot of wild plants, but he had used all of his waterdrops on the super beast souls.\n\nWhile effective, it wasn\u2019t as effective as feeding them black crystals. The gold raven had finally started to evolve now, though, becoming a berserk super creature beast soul.\n\nHan Sen hadn\u2019t had his other super creature beast souls for long, so nothing was happening with them just yet.\n\n\u201cMoment, have you found any solo super creatures roaming about?\u201d Han Sen asked her, while sitting on the throne.\n\n\u201cI saw one, yes. But I don\u2019t think we have what it takes to fight it.\u201d While Moment Queen addressed Han Sen\u2019s questions immediately, her mood seemed off.\n\nDuring Han Sen\u2019s several-year absence, Moment Queen had become the boss of the shelter. The leash had been disconnected, so-to-speak, and she was free to do as she wished.\n\nNow that she had to start taking orders again, she was quite peeved.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of creature is it?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nMoment Queen must have gotten quite strong across those years, and she must have opened several gene locks by now.\n\nShe still wasn\u2019t up to par with Han Sen, though. Plus, Han Sen had the faithful and diligent Disloyal Knight and Blue Dinosaur to back him up. Aside from berserk super creatures, he\u2019d have no trouble hunting whatever he wished to.\n\nMoment Queen did not yet know how powerful Han Sen had become, so she was just telling him based on the assumption a super creature would be too much to handle.\n\nThe creature she spoke of resided deep inside Thorn Forest, and it was described as a scaly lizard. It was only two meters long, and she had seen it during her time of moving the shelter.\n\nThe creature was dining on an array of different bugs, consuming dozens with each mouthful. If it wasn\u2019t for a bunch of sacred-blood bugs that got munched on all at once, she wouldn\u2019t have guessed it for a super creature, given its rather tame appearance.\n\nHan Sen decided to hunt the super creature. He commanded Moment Queen to move the underground shelter to the valley, and there, he bid for the Blue Dinosaur to enter.\n\nIt was the biggest and strongest tank a party could ask for. It was a meatshield that could withstand the grizzly blows of a berserk super creature.\n\nMoment Queen was taken aback when she saw the beast. The other humans in the shelter were even more shocked.\n\n\u201cHave you happened to see any sacred-blood scorpions on your way here?\u201d Han Sen asked, before they departed.\n\n\u201cI have seen some, yes. Which type are you looking for?\u201d Moment Queen asked.\n\n\u201cWell, tell me which you have seen,\u201d Han Sen said, with curiosity.\n\nThe Transparent King Scorpion gem was useless just sitting in his inventory. It had to be infused with something."
