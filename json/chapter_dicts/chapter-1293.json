Why don\u2019t you go ahead and explain what the Luminous Stone is, then?\u201d\n\nMoving Star Emperor rebutted with, \u201cPah! You don\u2019t deserve to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, now you look like some pompous idiot who is only pretending to be superior. You shouldn\u2019t go around telling people you\u2019re an emperor, much less a spirit. Even talking to someone as thick as you has me feeling embarrassed.\u201d Han Sen wasn\u2019t willing to let this go so easily, and so he said a lot of mean things.\n\nBefore his enemy, he\u2019d never concede.\n\nMoving Star Emperor was notorious, but he had quite the reputation, though. Between spirits, disputes were often settled through battle. The opportunity to sort things out through discussions, as most humans did, rarely arose.\n\nKnowing he might be at a disadvantage made Moving Star Emperor extremely angry.\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t in Evil Lotus Shelter, he\u2019d already would have been trying to kill Han Sen through the tried and true method of a pummeling. He wanted to provoke Han Sen and get the human to attack him first so he could feign being the victim. But now, he found himself being the one ready to instigate a fight.\n\nMoving Star Emperor managed to swallow that big, bitter pill and reversed the dialogue instead. He said, \u201cIf you think it is that simple, then why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\nHan Sen explained it succinctly, \u201cThe Luminous Stone is a path of light.\u201d\n\nMoving Star Emperor addressed that hypothesis with disdain. \u201cNonsense! Night Empress practiced the path of darkness. It is a geno treasure attuned with the element of dark. Dark is the complete opposite of light. Pah! What a cheap race, only capable of talking crap.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was not mad. Humans knew a lot, and the Alliance possessed swathes of knowledge. Spirits could not understand things beyond the surface, and they could not understand things on a deeper level. Their development was in a whole different ballpark.\n\nPerhaps no human could beat Moving Star Emperor through physical means, but giving him a verbal beatdown was nearly child\u2019s play.\n\nHan Sen smiled and told the emperor, \u201cYou are ignorant. Light and Dark are two sides of the same coin. They both exist at the expense of each other. Light is dark, and dark is light. She may have practiced along a path of darkness, but she could also use the Light element. It\u2019s simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight is light, dark is dark. How can the two exist together? If she was still here, she\u2019d kill you for talking such drivel!\u201d Moving Star Emperor rebutted.\n\nHan Sen pointed at the lotus plants which were bathing in the soft glow, then he pointed to the darkness the light did not reach. He said, \u201cNow tell me, which is dark and which is light?\u201d\n\nMoving Star Emperor said, \u201cOf course the area with the Luminous Stone is light.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s light?\u201d Han Sen asked, with a smile.\n\n\u201cOf course, do you think I\u2019m blind? I\u2019m not!\u201d Moving Star Emperor said with frustration.\n\nHan Sen then cast fire and lit up the other side of the lake. The Luminous Stone could glow, but its glow was rather faint. The light it emitted was not very strong. But Han Sen\u2019s fireball was so bright, it made the stone\u2019s side dark.\n\n\u201cNow you tell me; which side is dark, and which side is light?\u201d Han Sen smiled again.\n\nMoving Star Emperor gave an ugly look, and it prompted Han Sen to explain, \u201cDark and light are one-and-the-same, see? Light is the absence of darkness, and darkness is the absence of light. They are two sides of the same coin, but both are dependent on each other. Night Empress sought darkness, but used light to guide her practice. She sought darkness through the light she possessed. A dumb*ss like you would never understand, my boy!\u201d\n\nMoving Star Emperor\u2019s face turned green. He was not an expert when it came to analyses like this, and so he had no clue how he should respond.\n\nClap! Clap! Clap!\n\nHan Sen turned around and saw a spirit clapping her hands gently. It was Lotus Empress herself.\n\nLotus Empress spoke, saying, \u201cSeeking darkness through the light? If my mother was still here in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary, she\u2019d be very fond of you. She\u2019d relish the opportunity to meet someone else who understood her.\u201d\n\nEmpty Witch flew close to her master and said, \u201cMiss Lotus! The Luminous Stone really is of the Light element?\u201d\n\nDue to the fact the Luminous Stone was blackened and charred by the fires of Holy Door, and its lifeforce had been depleted, and it looked to be of Dark.\n\nLotus nodded and said, \u201cThis was her only Light-element treasure. She left all the dark treasures here, but she only wished to take this one. It was once called the Stone of Light. The light was merely drained due to its incineration.\u201d\n\nWhen Moving Star Emperor heard this, he looked even worse. He looked as if he was going to faint. He didn\u2019t expect her most important treasure was not of the element of Dark.\n\n\u201cI thought it was pretty simple, really. I was just bringing it up in idle chit-chat,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen really was just saying it simply, without meaning for it to come across as a lesson. His knowledge was vast, and so it made him go above and beyond a simple explanation. Still, he couldn\u2019t really learn much from observing the stone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Han Sen was stupid, it was just that he hadn\u2019t reached that level of genius yet.\n\nMany Dark and Light emperors had visited this shelter in the past, but they only learned a small amount. The melody and rhythm of the pulsating light came from the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, so not being able to understand it was normal for someone who wasn\u2019t a demi-god."
