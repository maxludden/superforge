In order to protect her cover identity, she had to suppress her impatience for the time being.\n\nBut Fox Queen couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Han Sen had activated the Sacred Blood Statue, yet somehow managed to survive. She couldn\u2019t figure out how he had pulled that off.\n\nLong ago, Sacred Leader used the Sacred Blood Statue to control subordinates. Even his deified soldiers were subject to it. And the Sacred Blood Statue on Han Sen\u2019s back had been drawn in Ancient Blood Dragon Lady\u2019s blood. That sort of Sacred Blood Statue was reserved for use against deifieds. Han Sen was just a Duke. He wasn\u2019t even a King yet, so how could he survive?\n\nFox Queen was very confused, but it would be a while before she could travel to Planet Water Zone and find answers to her questions.\n\nAfter Han Sen returned to Underwater Town, he began researching the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. He couldn\u2019t discover anything unique about it. He put power into it, but he couldn\u2019t seem to activate the item. His only option was to drip his blood onto the stone mirror in the hope that it would come to acknowledge him as its master further down the line.\n\nEvery time Han Sen placed his blood upon the stone mirror, it would light up with the shadow of the Nine-Tailed Fox. When the shadow disappeared, the blood would go with it.\n\nHan Sen was trying to use the same method he had with the Jade Drum, but it didn\u2019t seem to be working.\n\n\u201cDid King Bao put the Foxes\u2019 Nine Spin Destiny Mirror in Destiny\u2019s Tower and place it beneath that statue? If so, why would he do that?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t come up with any answers to that question.\n\nThe stone mirror wasn\u2019t making any progress, and for the moment, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything Han Sen could do about that. The water fairy in the jade gourd was helping Han Sen grow stronger, though. She embodied the feelings of the Proud Bone Swordmind for him, and as a result, Han Sen felt as if his own swordmind was about to have a breakthrough.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t copy Mad Sword\u2019s swordmind, though. He used his own swordmind to fight with Mad Sword\u2019s. At first the fights were entirely one-sided, but after a while, Han Sen started to develop some resistance.\n\nMad Sword\u2019s swordmind wasn\u2019t suitable for Han Sen, so he didn\u2019t plan on using it directly. Instead, he used it as a grinding stone, sharpening his own swordmind against it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how strong Mad Sword\u2019s swordmind is; it isn\u2019t my own. It would only belong to me if I could fully understand it.\u201d Although improvements like this were much slower than if he were to simply copy Mad Sword\u2019s swordmind, Han Sen wasn\u2019t in any particular rush. He focused on each aspect of his swordmind, improving it a piece at a time.\n\nAlthough Han Sen had many King class core genes, and he had one hundred King class xenogeneic genes, he would need many more in the coming days. So, Han Sen still planned on going back to the core area to hunt for more core genes. It was always good to have more in the shed, after all.\n\nIf Han Sen\u2019s guess was correct, one hundred King class xenogeneic genes might raise his King area by one tier.\n\nHan Sen pushed his self-cogwheel to enter the core area again. He returned to the location where he had left, which wasn\u2019t too far from Planet Dark Zone.\n\nHan Sen wouldn\u2019t dare visit Planet Dark Zone again. Until he had enough strength, provoking that weird insect would basically mean committing suicide. His super god body didn\u2019t make him invincible, and the time limit was always a headache.\n\n\u201cOnce I become deified, will I be able to use an infinite amount of super god spirit body?\u201d Han Sen wondered as he flew.\n\n\u201cDollar, what a coincidence. Are you interested in cooperating again?\u201d Han Sen hadn\u2019t been flying for long when a group of people approached him. It was Dragon One, Dragon Eight, and some other Dragons.\n\nBut Dragon One and Dragon Eight were the only Dragons who had survived their last venture. The Dragons accompanying them now were new.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t answer. From another direction, a second group of people was swiftly approaching. The leader of that bunch was Dia Robber. As he flew closer, he said, \u201cIf you guys are cooperating, might it be okay if we join?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He had only just entered the core area, and these two had already found him. This couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.\n\n\u201cPeople, I am flattered. But I was hoping to venture out alone this time. Maybe another time?\u201d Han Sen said, rejecting their offers politely. He didn\u2019t know what they were after, and he didn\u2019t want to fight with them.\n\nHan Sen turned to leave, but Dia Robber immediately said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to work with us, that\u2019s fine. But I have a few mutant King class xenogeneics to go after. Are you interested in taking a look?\u201d\n\nHan Sen stopped. It took time to find mutant xenogeneics, so being able to travel straight to them would be a great help for Han Sen\u2019s leveling. If they were killing mutants, Han Sen could gain the xenogeneics\u2019 talents without needing to practice them.\n\n\u201cNot bad, not bad. I have a lead on a few mutant xenogeneics, as well. If you are interested, you know the rules and shares,\u201d Dragon One then said.\n\nHan Sen was very tempted by both offers. If things really were as they said, killing a few mutant xenogeneics would be very beneficial for Han Sen. Plus, he would be getting fifty percent of the spoils from the entire fight, not just what he personally killed. And there would be no need to spend time seeking the xenogeneics out. Opportunities like this were hard to come by.\n\nAfter a brief period of silent thought, Han Sen still turned down both offers. If he chose a side now, he would only end up offending the other.\n\nHan Sen wasn\u2019t worried about offending others, but in this case, it was unnecessary.\n\nSince Han Sen hadn\u2019t agreed, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to kill those mutant xenogeneics by themselves. They would need Han Sen\u2019s help in the future, anyway. Perhaps he could receive more benefits like this later on.\n\nDragon One and Dia Robber seemed to expect Han Sen to turn them down, so they didn\u2019t appear to be disappointed. They still spoke to Han Sen with glee and respect, hoping they could cooperate again in the near future.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so nice to him? Do you think the Destroyed need a King like him?\u201d Barr asked once Han Sen had left.\n\nDia Robber was one of the few people that could make Barr listen. If Dia Robber wasn\u2019t there, he would have fought Han Sen. It wasn\u2019t that Barr didn\u2019t like Han Sen; he just enjoyed fighting powerful people.\n\nDia Robber nodded with sincerity, and he said, \u201cYes, we really need someone like him.\u201d\n\nSeeing Barr fall silent, Dia Robber sighed and said, \u201cWe need him because he is stronger than us. Sure, the deified members of our race are stronger than he is, but that matters little because they can\u2019t enter the core area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they cannot come, then they cannot come. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Barr grunted in annoyance.\n\nDia Robber smiled and said, \u201cThere is no big deal. But if we want to kill deified core xenogeneics in the core area, then we need him. Do you think our Destroyed Kings could escape a deified xenogeneic the way Dollar did?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t have an area power to restrict strength, an ordinary deified xenogeneic couldn\u2019t kill me,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\u201cYou are the best King we have, but hunting deified xenogeneics with just you and I would be an impossible task. We might succeed, but we would sacrifice a lot. With Dollar\u2019s help, that can change. The success rate would be higher, and we wouldn\u2019t sacrifice as much. What is the harm in that?\u201d Dia Robber asked, shaking his head."
