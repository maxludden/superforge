    "text": "\u201cWhat fun thing are you referring to?\u201d Han Sen asked the Fox Queen worriedly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here, with nothing but stone walls and icy water. How many forms of entertainment do you think are available here? Of course, you must know what I\u2019m referring to\u2026\u201d Fox Queen\u2019s eyes smoldered as her voice drifted off. She salaciously licked her red lips, then moved one hand into her white gown. The other hand started to drift across her boobs.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but follow her hands. He mumbled in his heart, \u201cBeing horny is bad. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. At the end of the day, we\u2019re just skeletons.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fox Queen sounded very seductive, Han Sen doubted that her intentions were as simple as she pretended. She had to be a King class elite, at the very least. God only knew what she was up to.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t believe she would lure him all the way there just for a little cuddle time.\n\nShe was a King class elite, so she could be planning anything. She was the wife of General Ghost Bone, and Han Sen didn\u2019t even know if the man was dead or alive. If he was still alive, and he caught his wife cheating with Han Sen, things would turn out very poorly for Han Sen.\n\nFox Queen winked at Han Sen. She brought her hand away from her boobs, revealing the black bone key she had been retrieving. She displayed it in her hand.\n\nThe key had hung like a pendant from a necklace made of white jade.\n\n\u201cThis will be very fun. Follow me.\u201d Fox Queen winked at Han Sen again. She kept the necklace in her hands as she walked towards the palace.\n\n\u201cWhat a tease. She sure likes to torture people.\u201d Han Sen watched her walk away, and he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Still, he followed her.\n\nThat palace was elegant. Han Sen had originally thought that it was made of jade, but when he examined the place more closely, he could see that the palace\u2019s doors and pillars were all built from bone.\n\nThe bones were semi-transparent like jade, and they glinted beautifully when the light caught them. He didn\u2019t know what creature left bones like that, though.\n\nThe bone palace had a primary hall, winged by two lesser halls on either side. The place wasn\u2019t large, and it was mostly decorated with bone adornments. Even the pool was made out of bone, not jade-like stone, as Han Sen had assumed.\n\nThe chains that bound Fox Queen were very thin. When she walked, the chains rose from the bottom of the pool. Evidently, they didn\u2019t restrain her movement.\n\nFox Queen was walking smoothly to the lesser left hall. Han Sen followed after her, and he saw there were many special treasures there.\n\nThere was an array of weaponry, sets of armor, jewels of all kinds, herbs, and all sorts of different treasures. Han Sen\u2019s breath caught in his chest as he looked at the place, and he desperately wished all of those goodies belonged to him and only him.\n\nSeeing Han Sen eyeing those treasures with such greed, Fox Queen smiled. She looked directly at him and said, \u201cIf you will agree to be my lover, all of this can belong to you. You can take whatever you please. How does that sound?\u201d\n\nHan Sen stopped looking at the treasures and turned his gaze to her. \u201cDid you bring me here just for that?\u201d\n\nFox Queen gave him a look of disdain. \u201cOf course not. What is the meaning of possessing all that useless stuff?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen walked in front of a wall that housed an enormous mural. Countless demonic faces had been drawn across it.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t recognize what kind of demons they were, but it looked like the gates of hell had been swung wide open. Many ghostly forces were trying to crawl out of a dark pit to unleash havoc on an unsuspecting world.\n\nThe faces held chilling expressions of greed and blood-lust. As Han Sen looked at the artwork, it seemed like the demons were about to leap to life and start devouring people.\n\nFox Queen stood on the left side of the mural, in front of the gate to hell. The closed gate was shaped like an enormous skeleton, and it was wreathed in wicked hellfire.\n\nFox Queen placed the black bone key into the skeleton\u2019s right eye. She twisted the key, and a loud clacking noise came from the mural.\n\nThe hellish, skeletal gate opened. The painted gate had become a real gate, which now opened into darkness on the other side of the wall. It was pitch black, like a black hole. A faint wailing noise came from that lightless pit, and hearing it gave Han Sen a chill.\n\n\u201cThe fun thing is in there. Do you dare enter?\u201d Fox Queen still stood next to the open door, smiling at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Han Sen shook his head.\n\nFox Queen didn\u2019t seem to mind the refusal. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I will ensure your protection. Follow me and I will lead you on a trip to hell.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Fox Queen stepped towards the hellish skeleton gate.\n\nHan Sen was thinking to himself, \u201cYou can go, but I sure as hell am not setting foot in there. God only knows what sort of trap is awaiting me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was quite resolute in his decision, but he swiftly realized that his body wasn\u2019t obeying him. He was headed into the hellish skeleton, too. He had no control of his limbs, like he was a puppet on strings.\n\nHan Sen looked at Fox Queen in fear. Half of her body was through the gate by this point, but she looked back and gave Han Sen another one of her smiles. She lifted a hand, and it was as if an invisible cord jerked Han Sen towards her.\n\nHan Sen cast his Dongxuan Aura and used the Purple-Eye Butterfly. He could see that Fox Queen was tugging on a chain made of some invisible substance. The chain was looped around Han Sen, allowing her to pull him along easily.\n\nHan Sen frowned. He didn\u2019t know when he had fallen into this trap of hers. He tried casting various powers to see if he could escape from the chains, but it was all to no avail. Nothing he tried worked.\n\n\u201cShe managed to tie me up, and I didn\u2019t even notice. This Fox Queen is stronger than I presumed. Maybe she\u2019s actually deified?\u201d Han Sen used a few more powers, but they didn\u2019t work, either. That gave him a big shock.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t free himself from the restraints, so he decided to stop fighting them. He allowed Fox Queen to lead him towards the hellish gate.\n\n\u201cI cannot escape if she wishes to kill me with her talents. I would rather walk in there calmly than be dragged in like some dog,\u201d Han Sen thought. And truth be told, he was rather curious about the skeletal gate. Of course, if he had the choice, he wouldn\u2019t be walking inside just to satisfy his curiosity.\n\nFox Queen smiled. She walked through the gate with Han Sen following.\n\nWhen Han Sen stepped inside, he felt a sudden force of suction drag his body forward. A bright light shone around him, and he was transported somewhere else in the space of a second."
