It was firm and menacing to hear, but there was a glimmer of genuine surprise and relief as an undercurrent to the tone.\n\nHan Sen looked around and suddenly realized his environment had changed; he was inside his own consciousness. Ahead of him was a red lotus, and in its fold, something was trying to wiggle its way out.\n\n\u201cEvil Lotus Queen, you belong to her. And she has marked you?\u201d Dragon King\u2019s voice roared with sudden anger, and he went on to say, \u201cIf she is here, I would do best to avoid her. But you are merely a marked subordinate; there is nothing you can do to prevent my rebirth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon King, I think it would be best if you did not leave the lotus. You should go back to your ring.\u201d Han Sen was not afraid of Dragon King.\n\nThe Dragon King that sought to invade his mind was not the emperor he once had been. Now, he was only a king spirit. If his body was there, then perhaps Han Sen would have been unable to beat it.\n\nBut with only his mind there, playing an away game, he was nothing compared to Han Sen.\n\nAfter all, Han Sen was a super king spirit that also possessed a super king body. Dragon King was only a king spirit, and had no body at all.\n\n\u201cWhat a fool! Do you think me feeble, without a body? I will make a good vessel out of you!\u201d The encased dragon raged against the lotus folds and did its best to escape entrapment.\n\nCracks began to run the length of the petals, and it looked as if it would soon break.\n\nSuddenly, the lotus began to shine. And then, fresh petals began to grow to replace the near-broken ones and keep the dragon contained even tighter.\n\n\u201cI am a dragon\u2026 break!\u201d The dragon roared, and then, the red lotus burst into flames.\n\nSeeing the red lotus get destroyed, Han Sen was delightfully happy. He had never lifted the mark that had been stamped on him, in fear of triggering the lotus.\n\nNow that Dragon King had removed the lotus stamp on his behalf, he was actually grateful.\n\nFar away, in a palace, Lotus Queen frowned and said, \u201cDragon King was not killed for good, and furthermore, he has touched my man. Even the Demon Emperor has returned. Oh, I\u2019m going to make that Dragon King suffer.\u201d\n\nDragon King, breaking free from the constraint of the lotus, exclaimed to Han Sen, \u201cNow, I can use you as a vessel. And when I return to the world outside this pitiful mind\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Dragon King was able to finish his dialogue, the shadow of a holy white light beamed in front of him. Against that, even his draconic powers were no longer intimidating.\n\n\u201cHow\u2026 how can your mind be so strong?!\u201d In front of that shadow, his dragon-body was stripped of all its fierceness. It looked weak and frightened, by comparison.\n\n\u201cI told you to return; you brought this upon yourself.\u201d Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit mind prepared to attack the blood dragon.\n\nDragon King roared and attempted to flee.\n\nThe figure of a super king spirit leapt forward and palmed Dragon King, making it wheeze blood.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t physical blood. It was Dragon King\u2019s actual lifeforce, and as it seeped out, Han Sen was able to consume and absorb every last morsel of it.\n\n\u201cSuper King Spirit Self Gene +1.\u201d\n\nWhen Han Sen heard this, he was delighted. He squeezed the frail dragon repeatedly, to gain more and more self geno points.\n\nDragon King was in utter shock. He was so powerful, but against the spirit that now pounded him, he was helpless.\n\nThe blood dragon was like a dying lizard, unable to withstand the hits. Escape was impossible for it.\n\n\u201cI am a true dragon!\u201d Dragon King knew he\u2019d be broken for good soon, and he\u2019d never return. He had to do whatever he could to ensure his survival. But Han Sen wouldn\u2019t let him, and in response to Dragon King\u2019s proclamation, he made the spirit\u2019s draconic body explode with a bright white light.\n\nAmidst all the brilliant light, the dragon tried to slip away.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just come and go whenever you please.\u201d Han Sen reached out his hand and grabbed the dragon-blood lifeforce.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Dragon King shouted, as the tiny sliver of lifeforce was taken by Han Sen\u2019s hand. Dragon King was being dominated, and Han Sen would not show mercy to someone who had sought to usurp his body.\n\nAbsorbing every glint of light he could, Han Sen\u2019s super king spirit self geno points count continued to increase.\n\nReaching down to the flailing dragon, Han Sen squeezed it tight.\n\n\u201cSuper King Spirit Self Gene +1.\u201d\n\nMore of the dragon\u2019s lifeforce was absorbed, and with it, Han Sen\u2019s geno points increased again.\n\nAfter squeezing some more, the dragon was beaten. It only had the strength to let out a pitiful scream.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! I can give you something wonderful in return for your mercy. Please, just let me live and it is yours!\u201d Dragon King begged and pleaded for his life.\n\n\u201cOkay, then tell me what I can have. This better be good. And if I don\u2019t like what I hear, you\u2019re dead meat!\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\nDragon King quickly responded, telling him, \u201cI am one of Demon Emperor\u2019s generals. When he went to the Fourth God\u2019s Sanctuary, he left me his armor. I can give it to you. Please, just don\u2019t kill me.\u201d"
