Han Sen was able to simulate Moment Queen\u2019s energy flow, but so far, he could only speed up time and not slow it.\n\nHan Sen only had one hundred time king spirit geno points, unlike Moment Queen, who was born with a direct attunement to the element.\n\nHan Sen could only simulate a bit of Sky King\u2019s space energy flow, but it was enough to allow Han Sen to condense space without his opponent realizing what he was doing. It was not too dissimilar to the method used to travel across hyperspace; punching a hole through the fabric of the dimension and creating a shortcut.\n\nOf course, these two abilities only applied to Han Sen. They had no effect on others when used.\n\nHan Sen wanted a high-damage hyper geno art, and he still would once this creation process was over. This was because his current creation did not inflict damage on an opponent.\n\nHan Sen kept on practicing these two abilities, trying to find a way in which he might be able to combine them.\n\nSpeeding up time allowed Han Sen to move faster. Condensing the space in his proximity also made him quicker, in a certain sense. In the eyes of others, he\u2019d be moving at a blistering speed that no one else could properly register. Han Sen was able to use these techniques to speed up and reduce the range he had to traverse to attack.\n\nHan Sen dwelled on the final results this hyper geno art would yield, and how the finished product might look and feel like. The concept was promising, at the very least.\n\nAfter a day of work, the researchers all left. Han Sen remained, though, making use of the zero-g room to practice various time and space techniques.\n\nThe more he practiced, the better he would get. That was true for everyone with everything. It was simple, but infinitely effective. Practicing was the only way to get a true grasp and understanding of something, and that was a universal truth.\n\nHan Sen practiced hard, working up a sweat. He didn\u2019t notice that Professor Long was outside the room, watching him.\n\nProfessor Long was supposed to have already left for the day, but he had forgotten something in the lab. He saw some light in the zero-g chamber, so he thought to check it out.\n\nProfessor Long nodded when he saw Han Sen. Professor Long had learned quite a bit about Han Sen, but he didn\u2019t understand why Bai Yishan and Li Xinghua liked him so much, up until now.\n\nIt was because through Han Sen, they could see themselves when they were much younger. He was quiet, but he worked hard. He didn\u2019t get distracted easily, and he was all-around very different than most young people.\n\nIf Han Sen focused on research, there was no doubt he\u2019d become an acclaimed researcher and garner great fame. He\u2019d accomplish much, Professor Long believed.\n\nProfessor Long was similar to Han Sen, so he admired him a lot, too. When Han Sen first arrived late, he saw how diligent he was in trying to catch up on what he had missed. For that reason, Professor Long was happy to extend an invitation for him to visit the lab and help.\n\nHe was very satisfied with Han Sen\u2019s performance, and although Han Sen had a long while to go and much, much more to learn, Professor Long could see that a bright future awaited him. He\u2019d walk away from the lab with much knowledge.\n\nProfessor Long was going to leave Han Sen alone, but when he saw the way Han Sen moved, he was fascinated. As a professor who researched space and time, he noticed Han Sen was practicing space.\n\nHan Sen seemed able to take one step and travel one hundred meters. It was like Han Sen had a warp drive installed in his body.\n\n\u201cHe has talent with the element of space?\u201d Professor Long was surprised.\n\nSpace talent was rare. Professor Long had two researchers with the space talent, but they were awful and ridiculously expensive to hire. To Professor Long, Han Sen\u2019s importance had greatly increased.\n\nHumans were not machines. Machines could use energy to travel and crack space. But this was a human, and Han Sen had just demonstrated the ability to travel in the manner of hyperspace. It was an action he performed with no technological aid. It was practically unheard of.\n\nProfessor Long thought he was very good with the element of space. But that was a topic that Professor Long wasn\u2019t as well-versed on, due to his inability to practice it.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe Han Sen has this much talent.\u201d Professor Long looked at Han Sen and licked his lips, as if he was a treasure he could never risk losing.\n\nHan Sen had no idea Professor Long was checking him out in such a manner. He wasn\u2019t in the sanctuary right now, so he did not have to pay attention to his immediate surroundings at all times like he normally would. He could relax and be a little more carefree when he was in the Alliance.\n\nOver the course of those two months, Han Sen continued practicing his teleportation and time-adjustment techniques vigorously. Unfortunately, they remained separate, and he was unable to figure out a way to combine them.\n\nBut on this evening, when he was done practicing with the space element, he turned his focus to time.\n\nWhen Professor Long saw this, his jaw dropped. His mind raced as he yelled to himself, \u201cHe has talent with both time and space?!\u201d\n\nProfessor Long felt as if he had just won the lottery. He smiled madly as he stared at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cThis is most wonderful.\u201d Professor Long watched Han Sen as if he were watching a naked woman.\n\nAs Han Sen continued to practice, a sudden shiver ran down his spine.\n\n\u201cWhy am I covered in goosebumps? Did the temperature drop?\u201d Han Sen then checked the thermostat, wanting to raise the temperature.\n\nProfessor Long had never before seen a human with proficiency in both talents. And now, his mind was racing with all sorts of ideas of what he could with Han Sen. He was very excited."
