    "text": "This was bad. Han Sen shoved the white whale to full acceleration so they could get out of the Black Hole Spider\u2019s territory. The white whale\u2019s engine labored so hard that it released enormous clouds of smoke, but the white whale didn\u2019t go forward. It seemed to be being pulled back.\n\nHan Sen looked behind them, and he saw the Black Hole Spider spreading its jaws. Its open mouth was like a giant black hole. It formed a vortex in space that sucked the white whale toward its gaping maw.\n\n\u201cWe are going to die! Who is going to save me? I don\u2019t want to die\u2026 I\u2019m a virgin\u2026 I still haven\u2019t gotten married\u2026\u201d Ning Yue sat on the floor, holding Bao\u2019er and sobbing.\n\nAll the pirates were in shock. They had heard about the Black Hole Spider before. Even in the wild systems of chaos, the Black Hole Spider was the top of the food chain.\n\nHan Sen pushed the white whale to the max, but the white whale was only being pulled back faster. The hull ground against the fabric of space as it was pulled backward, spawning a flurry of sparks.\n\nPang!\n\nAn unexpected asteroid suddenly slammed into the side of the white whale. The white whale began to spin.\n\nBefore Han Sen had time to think, the white whale fell completely into the grip of that black hole. It spun faster and faster inside the black hole, and other small objects slammed into the white whale. Each strike made a horrible sound. The pirates rolled across the floor like a bunch of gourds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d Ning Yue was screaming with every breath.\n\nHan Sen moved fast. He shifted his feet as the white whale rolled around. He kept himself balanced, using the Peacock King\u2019s soul robe. He was going to release a power of his own to get them out of that space vortex.\n\nBao\u2019er was jumping nimbly around the command deck, still holding onto her big purple ginseng. That kind of shaking was unable to affect her balance.\n\nLittle red bird stood on her shoulder. It kept looking around.\n\nPang!\n\nSeconds later, the white whale fell out of the space vortex. It landed on a black sea, and the big sea was in massive turmoil.\n\n\u201cWhat is this place? Why is there a sea?\u201d Han Sen wondered. He kept looking around. That black sea was so big that it looked endless. Mist rose in all directions, so he couldn\u2019t see very far.\n\nBatong! Batong!\n\nOther things kept raining into that same sea. There were asteroids, plants, the wreckage of ships, and even some xenogeneics.\n\nWhile Han Sen looked around in frozen silence, a planet even came down. It fell into the black sea, and the waves that rolled out from the impact sent the white whale flying. It kept rocked violently across the big waves, and it was some time before the ship stopped flipping.\n\nThen, Han Sen saw something even scarier. As all of these objects fell into the black water, they started to melt.\n\n\u201cAre we\u2026 inside the Black Hole Spider\u2019s stomach?\u201d Han Sen was looking at the mountain-like asteroids that appeared to be melting as he pondered the idea.\n\n\u201cOh no! We are done for\u2026 We are being digested to become poopoo. I don\u2019t want to become poopoo.\u201d Ning Yue sat on the floor, crying.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Our ship isn\u2019t being corroded.\u201d Han Sen observed the white whale\u2019s hull. The ship was like a deified creature itself, and so it wasn\u2019t dissolving under the corrosive power of the black water.\n\nBut Han Sen didn\u2019t know how long the white whale would last, so he also knew he had to get out of there as fast as he could.\n\nBut that Black Hole Spider was too big. It had captured the white whale merely by inhaling. Compared to the Black Hole Spider\u2019s size, the white whale was a tiny shred of meat.\n\nHan Sen then realized that the Black Hole Spider hadn\u2019t actually been attacking them; they had simply picked a terrible time to try to travel through the system. They had encountered the Black Hole Spider just as it decided to eat lunch.\n\nBased on what they could see through the mist, they knew that the spider had ingested countless asteroids and more than a few entire planets.\n\nHan Sen regained control of the white whale and guided it up and out of the big black sea. That dark water was probably the stomach juices of the Black Hole Spider.\n\nHan Sen drove the white whale, all the while dodging the falling asteroids. He wanted to get as high as possible. If this was the Black Hole Spider\u2019s stomach, he should have been able to get out via its esophagus.\n\nAfter traveling through the mist for God knew how long, he was unable to see any more asteroids falling. But he still couldn\u2019t find the esophagus.\n\n\u201cIs this really the Black Hole Spider\u2019s stomach? It\u2019s too big. Are we in another dimension, perhaps?\u201d Han Sen looked weirded-out as he spoke to himself.\n\n\u201cWe are dead!\u201d Ning Yue cried.\n\nFang Qing Yu had a wry smile, and he said, \u201cIf I have guessed things right, we are in the Black Hole Spider\u2019s body. And this is its stomach, or at least an organ that is similar to a stomach. The Black Hole Spider has space powers. It is deified, and its space powers extend through its body, as well. If we want to get out of here, we have to figure out the space powers locking this place down. If we don\u2019t, we aren\u2019t going to find a way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we break the space powers here?\u201d Han Sen asked as he glanced at Fang Qing Yu.\n\nFang Qing Yu smiled wryly again, and he said, \u201cThe only information I have on the Black Hole Spider is what I\u2019ve seen in the Thousand Treasures Alliance\u2019s database. I can try to guess what we are going up against, but I won\u2019t be able to break whatever it is. I hope the white whale can last a while. Otherwise, we will all be digested very soon.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He peered into the mist with his Purple-Eye Butterfly, and he noticed that the mist was made of substance chains formed of a space substance. The power of those substance chains was twisting space into a closed loop with the creature\u2019s stomach. He would be unable to fly out through ordinary means.\n\nBut he had to try, even if it didn\u2019t work. None of them knew if the white whale could withstand the corrosive juices and mist for long. If they couldn\u2019t get out, they were dead.\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t turn on the white whale\u2019s weapon systems because using those weapon systems would pull valuable power away from the energy reactor. The white whale didn\u2019t have an infinite amount of energy available for use at all times. If he used all the available energy, he would be unable to fly.\n\n\u201cLittle Red,\u201d Han Sen said to the little red bird.\n\nThe little red bird seemed to know what Han Sen wanted. It screamed and flew off of Bao\u2019er\u2019s shoulder. It became a fire phoenix and flew out of the white whale. It spat fire at the mist.\n\nThe red flames turned the space substances and substance chains into dust. But when the space substance chains broke, faults opened in space. It made reality very unstable around them. The little red bird almost fell into the cracks, so he came back.\n\n\u201cSo this is a space element deified xenogeneic.\u201d Han Sen looked gloomy. Space deified xenogeneics were scarier than he had believed."
