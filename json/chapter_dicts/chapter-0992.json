She wished to snatch it back.\n\nBut if she showed any interest in the ring, she knew Han Sen would take it away from her for good.\n\nBao\u2019er continued to play with it, and Moment Queen hoped she\u2019d soon lose her interest in it.\n\nAs Bao\u2019er swung her arms around, with her fist clenching the ring, it looked as if it\u2019d slip out from her grasp, any second.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, that belongs to the dead. You shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Han Sen was afraid she\u2019d end up eating the ring.\n\nBao\u2019er was stronger than anyone he knew, but on a certain level, she was still a baby. He still felt compelled to be as protective as any reasonable parent should.\n\nWhen Moment Queen heard him speak, she hoped Han Sen would tell her to discard the ring.\n\nShe knew she still had to act cool and not show any interest, so she held back for a while and just watched Bao\u2019er.\n\nBut then, Bao\u2019er stopped messing about and just sat there. She fiddled the ring between her fat, wrinkly baby-fingers. It seemed as if she was actually considering whether she should keep it or throw it away.\n\nSuddenly, she raised her hand as if to prepare a throw.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s glee and excitement immediately returned, and in her heart, she started shouting, \u201cThrow it! Yes, throw it!\u201d\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s hand raised the ring\u2026 and stopped. She didn\u2019t throw it, and the baby\u2019s crooked face suggested she was still deep in thought over whether or not to keep the ring.\n\nMoment Queen\u2019s face turned dim again. Soon, Han Sen would find the scale. And when he did, her opportunity of nabbing this ring for herself would go, too.\n\nBut then, Bao\u2019er pulled back her raised arm, as if to finally throw the ring away.\n\nThis delighted Moment Queen. But the rollercoaster of emotions showed no sign of slowing down, as Bao\u2019er\u2019s arm dropped with the ring still in her possession. Moment Queen\u2019s mind was furious, screaming, \u201cJust do it!\u201d\n\nFinally, Bao\u2019er came to a decision. Her face looked serious, and she seemed ready to throw it in Moment Queen\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. Come on, baby. Come on.\u201d Moment Queen opened her arms, as if to gesture that she should really throw it her way, and prepare to catch it.\n\nBao\u2019er\u2019s face dropped its babylike glee, though. She was serious, like a baseball player, preparing to throw the game-saver.\n\nSeeing Bao\u2019er ready to throw, Moment Queen\u2019s hands opened wide. The baby\u2019s arm launched forward but\u2026 no ring left the clutch.\n\nBao\u2019er smiled to Moment Queen like a little demon. She stood up, with the ring firmly in her hands, and ran over to Han Sen.\n\nBao\u2019er climbed on top of Han Sen\u2019s back and forced the ring on him.\n\nHan Sen accepted the ring and smiled at Moment Queen.\n\nMoment Queen, after seeing their impish smiles, knew she had been tricked.\n\nHan Sen must have known there to be something special with the ring a long time ago. To test her faithfulness, and whether or not the ring was a worthy item for the taking, he pranked her.\n\n\u201c*sshole! *sshole father! *sshole daughter!\u201d Moment Queen\u2019s mind was an inferno of raging hatred, particularly so when she realized she had been tricked by a baby.\n\nHan Sen took the ring. He didn\u2019t know what good it would do him, if any, but if Moment Queen wanted it that badly, then he knew he\u2019d be better off with it.\n\nHan Sen did not say anything, though. He ignored Moment Queen and continued searching. He lifted up the armor and saw a scale that looked like that of a fish. It almost looked like a shell.\n\n\u201cBrother Dragon, you\u2019re very dead, aren\u2019t you? That means you won\u2019t be needing this, right? Don\u2019t worry, skeletor, I\u2019ll make good use of it. You have my word. And who knows? I might make you famous again,\u201d Han Sen said to the withered husk, as he plucked the scale from its bony torso.\n\nPerhaps it was because the body was dry, but he had no problems taking the scale.\n\nWhen his fingers felt the scale, it was cool to the touch. The scale was white and semi-transparent.\n\n\u201cMoment, is this the reversed scale you mentioned?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Moment Queen coldly answered.\n\n\u201cIs there anything else around this place worth taking?\u201d Han Sen asked, with a tone of slight mocking.\n\nMoment Queen wanted to kill Han Sen. If it wasn\u2019t for the ring, he wouldn\u2019t even have learnt about the scale, either.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Moment Queen coldly said.\n\nDragon King died because of his attempt to level up. It was not his tomb or shelter, so it was likely she was telling the truth and there really was nothing else worth taking.\n\nFinding the ring was lucky enough. And it was only through the emperor\u2019s stubbornness it was there for Han Sen to claim.\n\n\u201cWell, if there\u2019s nothing else for us here, we should take our leave.\u201d Han Sen then returned the way he had come, and placed the angry Moment Queen back in the Sea of Soul.\n\nWith Bao\u2019er up front, leading the way, the return trip to the shelter did not take long. Resting in his hall, Han Sen fiddled with the ring and scale he had retrieved.\n\n\u201cMoment Queen wanted this thing pretty badly. I wonder what it does, exactly?\u201d Han Sen couldn\u2019t discern what made either item special.\n\n\u201cWell, treasure is treasure. And besides, I\u2019ve been needing a ring to pull my bow.\u201d Han Sen then placed the ring on his finger.\n\nWhen he wore it, though, the red of the ring seemed to come alive. It glowed menacingly, and the sound of a roaring dragon boomed through the hall."
