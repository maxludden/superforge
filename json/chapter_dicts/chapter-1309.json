He envisioned it to be a place of pure splendor and untouched beauty, but that image was quickly scorched away when his eyes finally caught sight of their destination.\n\nThe trees were little more than naked sticks, zig-zagging from the ground without their leaves, which lay scattered on the ground, black and dead. The landscape itself looked as if it had been wholly composed of mud, where grass was afraid of growing.\n\nIt was like a vulgar swampland, laden with itchy ditches and bogs that were strewn with rotten corpses.\n\nHan Sen\u2019s mind found it difficult to comprehend how a holy fruit could grow in such a place, especially one which had such sensitive and pure requirements for successful collection.\n\nLotus Empress led Han Sen to that wretched abode as if nothing was amiss.\n\nBefore long, they came across a tree that was standing short at a height of around three feet. The tree was growing out of that wet muddy ground, yet strangely, its roots were sparkling clean.\n\nIn the midst of that ugly, wet dump, the tree was emitting a fragrance that was actually quite pleasant. It was a strange and garish contrast to the landscape that now encompassed them, but the smell was so sweet that, if you closed your eyes, you could almost forget you were knee-deep in mud.\n\n\u201cThis is the No Dirt Fruit,\u201d Lotus Empress said, with a soft gesture towards the tree.\n\nBefore approaching it, Han Sen looked at a neighboring tree and squinted. Then, he quickly pulled her back and away from it.\n\n\u201cDoes the sanctuary\u2019s number one jester need to play assassin to get the drop on his enemies?\u201d Han Sen said loudly, for someone unseen to hear.\n\nLotus Empress was startled by his words, and she turned to where Han Sen looked. There, as if out of nowhere, No God Emperor was standing.\n\nNo God Emperor knew she would go there to collect the fruit, and that was why he had come. He had been waiting for their arrival. It was a risky place to have a confrontation. They were near the Endless Sea, and leaping about could have them twisting and turning through indecisive gravitational pulls.\n\nFurthermore, there was no guarantee they could beat No God Emperor, even if they fought him on a place with proper footing.\n\nHan Sen could not summon a demi-god there, either. The conditions of their encounter now were poor, and there wasn\u2019t much leeway to navigate away from having one last decisive brawl with the spirit that seemed to enjoy hounding them.\n\nNo God Emperor\u2019s voice boomed when he spoke. \u201cHow it comes about means nothing. Death is death, its deliverance uncaring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think you can kill us?\u201d Han Sen smirked.\n\n\u201cI know I can. I know I will. Night Empress is no longer around to help you this time, boy.\u201d No God Emperor walked forward with his black sword raised, ready to strike.\n\nHe didn\u2019t walk fast, just slow and steady. He was incredibly intimidating, and he knew it. He lowered the sword and pointed it towards Han Sen, the person he most despised.\n\nThat was his target, there was no doubt about it. He didn\u2019t even care to grace Lotus Empress with a glance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to summon her to kill you; I just thought it\u2019d be nice to see the old lady.\u201d As Han Sen entertained No God, he passed Bao\u2019er over to Lotus Empress. Then, he started to glow and mask his lifeforce.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s kill him together.\u201d Lotus Empress held the Night Gem in her hand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Look after Bao\u2019er and the professor; I got this,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nNo God Emperor did not wait any longer. He swung his sword in a sudden dash towards Han Sen, with a frightening amount of power.\n\nHan Sen dodged it with simple grace. The sword went by him, shattering a decayed skeleton that had been pinned to a tree behind him.\n\nThe evasion was perfectly executed, and it made No God stutter for a moment. He had expected to kill Han Sen then and there, and he wasn\u2019t sure if his human nemesis had escaped his wrathful strike through actual talent or dumb luck.\n\nThe next second, he slashed towards him again.\n\nHan Sen dodged the attack, only to be greeted by another sudden swing. Successfully, Han Sen dodged that and the next few that came in quick succession. The attacks could hardly even brush his clothes.\n\nLotus Empress was surprised, for dodging No God Emperor\u2019s attacks was unheard of. She knew for a fact she\u2019d have been cut down with the first strike.\n\nHan Sen was actually quite merry now. After he had opened his tenth gene lock, he stood a chance in his battle with the likes of No God Emperor.\n\nOf course, No God Emperor did not think highly of his opponent. He brushed Han Sen\u2019s newfound power off as weak, and simple fuel for cowardice, in that it allowed Han Sen to run away and little more.\n\nThere were others who could see through No God Emperor\u2019s attacks, but his focus was never on the power they held.\n\nNo God Emperor raised up his sword and began to brew a storm of power, like the rumbling of a volcano nearing eruption. As this was occurring, Han Sen noticed a shadow rise up behind No God Emperor like a demon.\n\nLotus Empress had taken Fish King, Bao\u2019er, and Bai Yishan off the island. Now, she stood solemnly, clutching her Night Gem.\n\n\u201cIs he strong?\u201d Bai Yishan asked.\n\nLotus Empress responded by saying, \u201cHe is the Son of God that ranked first in Divinity\u2019s Bout.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan was flabbergasted, exclaiming, \u201cWhoa! That means he\u2019s the strongest spirit in the entirety of the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary! Will Han Sen be alright competing against him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s the strongest,\u201d Lotus Empress said, before going on to explain, \u201cAnd Han Sen has only just opened his tenth gene lock. Honestly? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBai Yishan looked nervous, but that was when Bao\u2019er interrupted to say something a bit more comforting. She said, \u201cDad will win.\u201d\n\nThey thought Bao\u2019er was just like a naive child, unable to understand the stakes and powers at play.\n\nHan Sen, back on the battlefield, clutched Taia and the Phoenix Sword. He was really looking forward to stress-testing his engines and seeing what he could do with his Jadeskin that had ten gene locks open.\n\nThe spirit and the human, each clutching their favorite weapons, ran into each other.\n\nThey did not do so with blistering speed, but there was a gravitas to their battle that was rarely felt. This was a duel of tremendous significance, and it felt like the sky was about to collapse.\n\nBehind No God Emperor, there was a demon-like shadow. It bore talons that swung towards Han Sen."
