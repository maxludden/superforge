    "text": "The bottle world was inside the hall of the Very High\u2019s alpha. The restrictions there were extremely powerful. In all likelihood, not even a true god elite could access such a place without the Very High stamp that disarmed the restrictions.\n\nHan Sen was a man who had just become deified, and he was proudly announcing that he could use his own power to escape the alpha\u2019s hall. But his certainty aside, he was still locked inside the bottle world. Anyone would think Han Sen was crazy for claiming to be capable of such a thing.\n\n\u201cYou need to think about this. My offer now is your only chance,\u201d Exquisite said, looking intently at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cSend me back. It will look bad if people find us here like this,\u201d Han Sen said calmly.\n\nExquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking, and she felt rather touched by it. He didn\u2019t want her to get dragged into so much trouble on his behalf. That was why he was so determined to return to the bottle.\n\nBut Exquisite still didn\u2019t understand where Han Sen was getting his confidence. It was outlandish to think he could escape a true god prison of his own volition.\n\nSuddenly, Exquisite\u2019s face went blank. She sighed and said, \u201cNow it is too late for you to go.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she stopped hesitating. She took Han Sen back to the alpha\u2019s hall and returned him to the bottle world.\n\nWhen Exquisite returned into the bottle with Han Sen, she found Uncle Nine waiting for her inside. He looked at Exquisite and frowned. \u201cExquisite, come with me.\u201d\n\nHan Sen knew Uncle Nine must have found out that she had taken him away for a brief spell. It was fortunate that he didn\u2019t actually leave. Otherwise, the Very High would have considered Exquisite to be a criminal.\n\nExquisite looked at Han Sen with a complex expression. Then, she followed Uncle Nine to leave the bottle world.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Very High haven\u2019t found out that the blood coral has escaped their seal and come back to me. It\u2019s amazing that even their elders didn\u2019t notice it was gone.\u201d Han Sen was very curious about the blood coral, but although it seemed to be quite resilient, he couldn\u2019t use it as a weapon. It was just a vessel for Old Blood Dragon Lady\u2019s body.\n\nHan Sen continued to modify his Under the Sky and Break Six Skies until he couldn\u2019t think of any way to take them further. Then he found the time to go to God\u2019s Farm again.\n\nHan Sen carefully entered God\u2019s Farm, but he didn\u2019t see Gu Wan\u2019er or God\u2019s Knife anywhere. The carriage that was pulled by nine unicorns had also vanished.\n\n\u201cGu Wan\u2019er should come back, right?\u201d Han Sen was no longer worried about his safety. He was worried about what had happened last time. The knife or its master might have decided to stop Wan\u2019er from coming to Demon Sheep Planet now.\n\n\u201cWhat is God\u2019s Farm, exactly? Is it a xenogeneic space or is it part of the normal universe?\u201d Han Sen realized he hadn\u2019t tried going back to the sanctuary from there. He knew the chances of it working were slim, but he didn\u2019t mind trying.\n\nBut when he tested it, he really was transported back home. Even Han Sen was surprised, and he said, \u201cIf I can travel back here, that means God\u2019s Farm is somewhere in the universe. It isn\u2019t a separate dimension like Outer Sky. If that is the case, then I will be free if I can escape the Demon Sheep Planet\u2019s restrictions.\u201d\n\nIf Han Sen\u2019s only problem was being trapped inside the bottle world, this would have made him extremely happy. But now, even though he was free, he couldn\u2019t be happy because he had no way of saving Wan\u2019er.\n\n\u201cShould I tell Lone Bamboo about Wan\u2019er? But I don\u2019t know where to find God\u2019s Farm unless I travel to it using the Four Sheep Cube. It is pointless to tell Lone Bamboo this. I need to figure it all out for myself first.\u201d Han Sen went back home. He saw his baby daughter Ling\u2019er and felt much more relaxed.\n\n\u201cMy dear Ling\u2019er, when Dad was not around, were you being naughty?\u201d He held Ling\u2019er in his arms. He kissed her on the cheek and smiled.\n\n\u201cLing\u2019er did behave. Daddy didn\u2019t behave,\u201d Ling\u2019er said with a blink.\n\n\u201cSince when have I been a naughty boy?\u201d Han Sen asked curiously.\n\nLing\u2019er looked at Ji Yanran, who was cooking in the kitchen. She quietly told Han Sen, \u201cDaddy hasn\u2019t been back for a long time. It has made Mommy very angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow angry is she?\u201d Han Sen quietly asked Ling\u2019er.\n\nLing\u2019er held onto Han Sen\u2019s neck, placed her little mouth next to Han Sen\u2019s ear, and whispered in a voice that only the two of them would hear. \u201cMommy said she would teach you a lesson when you came back.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nHan Sen stayed at home for a few days. Every now and again, he would return to God\u2019s Farm. He still hadn\u2019t seen Wan\u2019er or God\u2019s Knife, and he didn\u2019t have any idea when they would return to the planet.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just keep waiting like this. I guess it\u2019s time to see if I can break the defenses of Demon Sheep Planet.\u201d Han Sen looked up into the skies above him. He became a xenogeneic and flew up off the surface.\n\nJust like last time, as Han Sen was about to breach the atmosphere, countless knife lights manifested around him. Each attack dealt damage that was equivalent to the strike of a primitive deified elite. The sea of knife lights seemed endless.\n\nHan Sen could have ignored one or two of those knife lights, but he couldn\u2019t deal with them in the tens or hundreds. There were just too many of those knife lights. They swept toward him like a river, coming down on him without reprieve.\n\nHan Sen used his medusa shield to fight back, and although the shield didn\u2019t break, the scary impacts knocked Han Sen down from the sky. He shot to the surface like a meteor, creating a huge impact crater when he hit the ground.\n\nHan Sen made several attempts to get past the planet\u2019s defenses, but he realized he couldn\u2019t escape the planet using brute force. Even larva class deifieds wouldn\u2019t be able to break through the defensive net.\n\n\u201cIf my super god spirit body wasn\u2019t being affected by Wan\u2019er, I could escape. I haven\u2019t been able to use super god spirit body for the longest time, though. It only stays active for a few seconds, and I don\u2019t know if that would be enough time for me to escape.\u201d Now that he had exhausted his other options, Han Sen knew he\u2019d have to give it a try. He lifted his shield and flew into the sky once more.\n\nWhen his body could no longer take the impact of the knife lights, he lowered the medusa shield and activated his super god spirit mode.\n\nWhile he was in his invincible mode, Han Sen teleported. This attempt worked out much better than Han Sen had expected. His heart began to beat more quickly. He needed to teleport as far as he could in order to escape the planet\u2019s defenses. But when he teleported again, he lost track of how far he had traveled. When he emerged from the jump, he found himself in a strange part of the cosmos. After a while, he noticed located Demon Sheep Planet behind him; it was so distant that it appeared to be the size of his fist. It looked like little more than a small moon from here.\n\nHis super god spirit mode came to an end. It had only lasted long enough for him to teleport once.\n\nAs Han Sen looked around, he saw a group of people flying past. He looked closer, and he noticed a particular Destroyed amongst them. It was Barr."
