    "text": "The skeleton\u2019s clothing was a little bit different. It looked more like ordinary cloth or silk, and the style did not look protective. It was more like a simple fashion style.\n\nThe clothes were loose like a robe and mostly blue. The sides of the clothing had black flowers for decoration. They looked loose yet somber.\n\nThe purple light substances kept jumping across the clothing. It made the clothes shine brightly. The clothing was not decomposing, and the skeleton was not breaking.\n\nHan Sen thought, \u201cTo be able to be unharmed by the purple light stream, those clothes and the skeleton must be special. It is a shame I cannot use power. If I could, I would probably take the clothes for myself. Perhaps it is a high-level treasure.\u201d\n\nThe skeleton was close to them, bobbing up and down. It was within the purple light stream and kept moving through the purple light substances. It almost hit the space cabinet a couple of times. Han Sen was tempted to bring it inside.\n\nThe space cabinet was only big enough to fit one person inside. It was quite tight for him and Bao\u2019er to be in there. There was no room for the skeleton to squeeze inside too.\n\nPlus, the big goldfish said they had to hide and not show themselves. Otherwise, it would have all been for nothing. Han Sen kept thinking about it, but he eventually gave up on the idea.\n\nThe space cabinet kept moving with the purple light stream. Han Sen had no idea they were anymore. The skeleton was still wrapped up by the purple light stream. It occasionally drifted away from the space cabinet but never went too far.\n\nAfter a few more days, the red light on the scale started to become weaker. It seemed as if its energy was running out. The red light in the space cabinet had also dimmed. One was able to hear the space cabinet make some \u201ctzi-tzi-ah-ah\u201d noises. It sounded as if it was going to fall apart.\n\n\u201cThis scale is not going to last. What if the big goldfish was wrong?\u201d Han Sen looked outside. The purple light was still flickering.\n\nPang!\n\nBoth Han Sen and Bao\u2019er shook. It felt like the space cabinet hit something and was rolling like a ball. When the space cabinet stopped, Han Sen and Bao\u2019er noticed there was no more purple light trying to assault them.\n\nHan Sen looked outside the window. He did not see any more purple light. It was actually snow-white outside. It was different from the white dust. The snow there was not dust. It was actually snow.\n\nHan Sen saw a land of ice and snow.\n\n\u201cWe are here.\u201d Han Sen was happy. He suddenly heard a \u201ckatcha\u201d sound. The space cabinet could not stay together any longer. It shattered and broke into pieces all over the snow. Han Sen and Bao\u2019er were exposed to the snow. The fish scale Han Sen held shattered like a crumbling rock. It was all over the floor.\n\n\u201cThis place is just as the big goldfish said.\u201d They had been inside the space cabinet for many days. Bao\u2019er was happy to be freed from the cramped space.\n\nPang!\n\nThe two of them looked around the snowy field of ice. They wanted to locate the place the goldfish had talked to them about. Something suddenly fell from the sky and landed right next to them.\n\nHan Sen and Bao\u2019er turned their heads. It was the skeleton. It had dropped right into the snow near them.\n\n\u201cDad, it is that skeleton.\u201d Bao\u2019er ran over to the skeleton and squatted down next to it. She used her finger to poke the skeleton\u2019s brain. The skeleton\u2019s brain suddenly turned. There was no more movement.\n\nHan Sen walked over and smiled. \u201cHis clothes must be good stuff. There is no point in him holding on to them. He should do something nice and give them to us. We can bury him in exchange. We all benefit that way.\u201d\n\nAfter Han Sen said that, he started prodding the skeleton. He wanted to see if, aside from the clothes, there was another treasure inside the pockets.\n\nHe did not find any treasures. Inside one of the pockets, he saw something. He could not tell what it was. He put his hand inside and pulled the thing out.\n\n\u201cIt is a pair of glasses\u2026 These cannot be the same glasses the crystallizers had.\u201d Han Sen was looking at the glasses.\n\nThe glasses kind of looked like toad sunglasses, but the lenses were black. They were not transparent. They were as solid as ink.\n\nHan Sen put the glasses on. The moment he did that, the glasses displayed a weird sort of power. The power only spread onto Han Sen and did not go anywhere else.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 Dad\u2026 Why did you turn into a big ape?\u201d Bao\u2019er\u2019s eyes were opened wide as she looked at Han Sen.\n\nThe sunglasses were not transparent, but Han Sen could see everything. He looked at himself and realized he had been turned into a big ape. He was shocked.\n\nHe took off the sunglasses, and his body returned to normal.\n\n\u201cThis is a god personality armament.\u201d Han Sen looked at the sunglasses in his hands. His heart jumped. The sunglasses vanished. They appeared in the Sea of Soul.\n\nThis was different from the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. After killing the God Spirit, that god personality armament should have been one used to make the other god personality armament. It was just like the Sky Armor Scabbard. It was not a god personality armament one collected right away.\n\n\u201cDad, let me try it. I want to be a big ape.\u201d Bao\u2019er approached Han Sen with a look of excitement.\n\nHan Sen gave Bao\u2019er the sunglasses. She put them on, and her body changed. Her face changed, but she did not become a big ape. She became a bee that was the size of a fist. She flapped her wings and buzzed in Han Sen\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cDad, I became a little bee,\u201d Bao\u2019er said while happily flying.\n\n\u201cThese glasses can change people\u2019s bodies. That is fairly amazing,\u201d Han Sen thought. Bao\u2019er, who was a little bee, landed on the floor. She then turned into a white rabbit.\n\n\u201cDad, I became a white rabbit!\u201d Bao\u2019er was very excited. She kept jumping. She suddenly turned into a pigeon in the air.\n\nIn a short amount of time, Bao\u2019er was able to turn into many different things. Han Sen was frozen. He said, \u201cHoly crap. This thing is like the monkey king that can change 72 times.\u201d\n\nAfter watching her for a while, Han Sen got bored. He squatted down and tried to take off the skeleton\u2019s robes. The robes had been able to survive the purple light stream, so they had to be made with some good stuff.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be another god personality armament, can it?\u201d Han Sen took off the robe. He did not put it on yet. He looked at the skeleton and started digging a hole in the ice. He put the skeleton inside. He closed his hands and said, \u201cI put you in the soil\u2026 No, I put you in the ice so that you do not have to be exposed. Thanks for the items you have given us, but now we no longer know each other.\u201d"
