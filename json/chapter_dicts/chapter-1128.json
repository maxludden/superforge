    "text": "The man tried his hardest to kill himself, repeatedly. But each and every time, the shadow stopped him. Uncle Bug was crying again, with a face that was full of regret and pain.\n\nThe man had been savagely injured, but he couldn\u2019t be free and allow himself to die.\n\n\u201cLittle Yan, stop this!\u201d Uncle Bug guiltily pleaded.\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect? Is this what you wanted me to become?\u201d the man angrily responded.\n\nIn continued tears, Uncle Bug exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, but you were sick! It said it would fix you. I didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Bug\u2019s tears did not relent.\n\n\u201cHe fixed me, and I am not dead\u2026\u201d The man was laughing, but it was a laughter of hysteria. This was worse than him crying.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\nThe man, who was laughing like a madman, responded, \u201cYou are not! You made me suffer something that was worse than being killed.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug grabbed his own hair, all the while crying. \u201cIf I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Bug\u2019s dialogue disintegrated into incoherent mumbling and babbling.\n\nThe man looked at Uncle Bug, saying, \u201cThis is my life.\u201d\n\nHis words were coaxed with desperation and sadness. After a while, the sun began to rise. And as it did, the man said, \u201cIf you continue to believe I am your son, find someone to kill me. I would rather be dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Yan!\u201d Uncle Bug looked at the man in profound sadness, but as he did, the man fell to the ground.\n\nHan Sen was surprised at the sudden turn of events. He was still alive, just unconscious.\n\nUncle Bug used a bag to pick the man up, and then turned to leave the area.\n\nIf Han Sen described what had happened to someone who hadn\u2019t seen it with their own eyes, they\u2019d think he was off his rocker.\n\nHan Sen quickly followed after Uncle Bug to see where he was off to.\n\nHan Sen thought it might have something to do with the god that Sunset had mentioned. Perhaps by following, he could learn more and uncover the mystery at long last.\n\nUncle Bug took the man back through the forest to Nest Shelter, though. Then, he took the man to his room.\n\nHan Sen waited outside the room. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that Uncle Bug emerged, acting as if nothing had occurred. He issued commands and went back to his usual duties, telling others to hunt and so on.\n\n\u201cUncle Bug, there is something I need to ask you. Privately, if I may,\u201d Han Sen asked Uncle Bug.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for privacy. Just tell me here, and I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d Uncle Bug smiled, acting his usual self.\n\nBut Han Sen then implored, \u201cI really must speak to you alone about this.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug sighed and took Han Sen to a place outside the shelter.\n\n\u201cLittle Han, tell me what\u2019s the matter. If it is within my capacity to help, I will,\u201d Uncle Bug said as he lit up a cigarette.\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about the Secret Service\u2019s Seventh Team?\u201d Han Sen asked.\n\nUncle Bug casually shook his head, asking, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know Han Jinzhi?\u201d Han Sen then asked.\n\nUncle Bug responded, \u201cYour great-grandfather is Han Jinzhi. He must be a great man if you keep mentioning him.\u201d\n\nHan Sen then said, \u201cThen you must know Sunset.\u201d\n\nUncle Bug looked at Han Sen strangely, clearly not expecting such a response. He told him, \u201cI must be getting too old. I don\u2019t remember a person called Sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must know Little Yan,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nUncle Bug\u2019s body shivered. He stiffened himself up, telling Han Sen, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anyone going by these names.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou forgot what you wished for?\u201d Han Sen said mockingly.\n\nAfter that, Uncle Bug\u2019s composure changed. He suddenly looked like an angry lion, and he exclaimed, \u201cWho are you?!\u201d\n\nHan Sen could feel Uncle Bug\u2019s lifeforce, and he could tell the man was the greatest and most powerful surpasser he had ever known.\n\nSurpassers these days never came close to the heights of Uncle Bug.\n\nAt his age, it was a surprise to see him have such a high fitness. Humans did not max out their genes back when Uncle Bug had been in his prime, so it was quite the surprise to see how powerful the old man had become.\n\n\u201cDo you really not know who I am? I told you the name of my great-grandfather.\u201d Han Sen looked at Uncle Bug.\n\n\u201cThat is impossible. He cannot have had an heir,\u201d Uncle Bug said.\n\n\u201cWhy not? Everyone can make babies,\u201d Han Sen casually responded.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2026\u201d Uncle Bug suddenly stopped. His rage returned before he spoke again, and he blurted out, \u201cHow dare you try and trick me. I asked you a question first. Who are you?! If you don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019ll have to excuse my ruthless actions.\u201d"
