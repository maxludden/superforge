    "text": "\u201cDeified Xenogeneic hunted: Gold Robot General. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Gold Robot General beast soul.\u201d\n\nHan Sen was thrilled. \u201cI got its beast soul. Am I on a lucky streak to keep receiving their beast souls these days?\u201d\n\nWhen the Gold Robot General fell, its gold greatsword dropped from its loosened grip, too. Dragon One and the others were all ecstatic. After seeing this, they all ran up to Han Sen.\n\nBai Wan Jie watched Han Sen from afar, with his face cycling through a variety of different emotions. The members of his royal knights were all frozen, and none of them could speak.\n\nThe results of the battle were far too surprising. The Gold Armor General was considered too difficult to kill, and yet Dollar had single-handedly secured the victory. Watching Han Sen at that moment was like looking at a god and a demon. It left a really deep impression in their brains.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Dollar just soloed the Gold Armor General. Am I seeing this correctly?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was too f*cking scary. Dollar is too powerful. He just soloed a deified as a King. Can any of the Extreme King do such a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven someone else could do this, there\u2019s no way they could do it as casually as Dollar did. He must be a deified pretending to be a King.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter the King class audience watched the fight, they were all left looking shocked.\n\nThe yellow-clothed woman looked at Han Sen. Her pretty eyes had become unreadable as she spoke to herself. \u201cWhat is up with this Dollar character? What is his power? Interesting. How interesting. Is he stronger than Yu Shanxin?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, we couldn\u2019t have done this without you\u2026\u201d Dragon One was so shocked and happy, he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say. If not for Dollar, the Dragons would surely have lost everything. Dollar had managed to pull them out of the fire and secure victory for them all by himself.\n\nAt that moment, Dragon One was only thinking that the one thousand xenogeneic genes he owed were well worth it.\n\n\u201cWhen can you pay me the second batch of five hundred xenogeneic genes?\u201d Han Sen asked, looking at Dragon One. After fulfilling the work he was tasked to perform, he required his payment.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2026 No, give us half an hour. We will deliver them right away!\u201d Dragon One had come to kill a deified xenogeneic. He couldn\u2019t have brought them with him. He immediately told his Dragon subordinates to retrieve the xenogeneic genes that the man was owed.\n\n\u201cBrother Dollar, are you interested in striking another deal?\u201d Dia Robber approached, lowering his voice as he spoke to Han Sen.\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cI have things to do. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\nDia Robber felt so annoyed. The reason why he let Dragon One ask Dollar first was that he himself wasn\u2019t confident in Dollar\u2019s abilities. He wanted to see how strong Dollar was before deciding to hire him.\n\nBut God knew Dollar was insanely strong. After all, he had practically killed the Gold Armor General all alone. Now that Dia Robber wanted to hire him and was unsure if he could, he was really regretting his previous hesitation.\n\n\u201cIf you have the time, Brother Dollar, we can discuss payment,\u201d Dia Robber said hopefully, praying he would still have a chance to hire Dollar.\n\n\u201cSure. I will contact you sometime down the line,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHan Sen handed the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger back to Dragon One. The Dragons quickly brought the other five hundred xenogeneic genes over. Han Sen took the xenogeneic genes back to the core area hall. Then, he placed them all inside Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\n\u201cWith one thousand xenogeneic genes, I can max out one King area, at least.\u201d Han Sen observed the mountain of King xenogeneic genes he had piled inside his Destiny\u2019s Tower. It gave him a warm and comforting feeling. He sighed and said, \u201cIt is nice to always have a little in the bank.\u201d\n\nSeeing so many xenogeneic genes all in one place was enough to make Han Sen start drooling. Then, he suddenly heard Wan\u2019er make some moaning sounds on a lower floor. When he went to see her, he saw her eyelids flicker. It looked as if she was going to wake up.\n\nHan Sen was shocked. He went back to the white whale and brought Wan\u2019er out of Destiny\u2019s Tower.\n\nEarlier, Han Sen had used his super god spirit to kill the Gold Robot General. He felt that Wan\u2019er\u2019s effect on him was weaker now. Her power was no longer canceling his super god spirit straight away. Han Sen thought that was weird.\n\nOriginally, he only wanted to use his super god spirit body to blind the Gold Robot General\u2019s eyes. He hadn\u2019t known it would last so long and enable him to do as much as he had.\n\nNow, it seemed as if Wan\u2019er waking up was in some way related to what had happened.\n\nWan\u2019er lay on the bed as her eyes slowly opened. When she saw that Han Sen was there, she suddenly jumped forward. She wrapped her arms around his neck and curled against his chest like a cat. She closed her eyes and gleefully said, \u201cBig Brother.\u201d\n\nHan Sen didn\u2019t know what to do, and he pushed her back a bit. He had yet to learn why Wan\u2019er was so insistent about calling him \u201cbig brother.\u201d He thought that having her as a sister was something he would probably remember.\n\n\u201cAhem, ahem. Wan\u2019er, do you remember your big brother?\u201d As he said that, even Han Sen thought his choice of words was a bit strange.\n\n\u201cOf course I recognize my big brother.\u201d Wan\u2019er leaned toward Han Sen. She closed her eyes as if she was dreaming and said, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be apart from you. I want to be with my big brother forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Wan\u2019er. Your big brother wants to be with you forever, too.\u201d Han Sen patted Wan\u2019er on the back like she was a child. And then he asked, \u201cDo you remember my name?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I remember. How could I forget my big brother\u2019s name? I would never forget my big brother\u2019s name.\u201d Wan\u2019er rubbed her face against Han Sen\u2019s chest in another feline motion.\n\n\u201cThen, what is my name?\u201d Han Sen asked in a rush.\n\nWan\u2019er raised her head. She looked at Han Sen with confusion and said, \u201cHas big brother forgotten his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I remember my name! I\u2019m testing you.\u201d Han Sen felt as if he was some kindergarten teacher.\n\nUpon hearing Han Sen say this, Wan\u2019er\u2019s face started to become red. It was so pretty, and she was looked like a piece of crystal that was about to cry. \u201cBig brother doesn\u2019t believe me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I believe you, Wan\u2019er! I am just kidding with you.\u201d Han Sen felt his resolve soften, and so he opted to try and comfort her.\n\nWan\u2019er laughed. She placed her cheek against Han Sen\u2019s chest, closed her eyes, and said, \u201cI want to be with you like I was before. I want to just chat and travel with you all around the universe. But Wan\u2019er feels so tired. I want to sleep a lot.\u201d\n\nHan Sen really wanted to know the name of Wan\u2019er\u2019s big brother, but he didn\u2019t know how to ask. He was in a rush about it, too.\n\nHan Sen felt as if dealing with Wan\u2019er might be harder than dealing with a deified xenogeneic. Dealing with a deified xenogeneic might at least give him a chance, but facing Wan\u2019er, he couldn\u2019t even use his full strength. It would be like punching cotton.\n\n\u201cBig brother\u2026 can we not go back to Sacred? Just the two of us together, forever\u2026 Together, forever,\u201d Wan\u2019er mumbled dreamily, and her voice became quieter and quieter.\n\nHan Sen froze. \u201cIs she really from Sacred? If she is, then who is her big brother? Is it someone else from Sacred?\u201d"
