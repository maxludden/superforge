He reached over with his arm and tried to touch the same wall Bao\u2019er\u2019s head was sticking out from, and much to his surprise, it went right through. It was an illusion.\n\nThe wall looked rock-solid, but that was only in appearance. There was nothing physical there, at all.\n\n\u201cDaddy, come!\u201d Bao\u2019er said.\n\nHan Sen pulled his whole body through, and when he looked up, he noticed he was in a large cave. Looking back, he could see the pine tree he had climbed, and the rest of the environment. It was like a one-way mirror of sorts.\n\nThe cave didn\u2019t seem like anything special, though. So, what might have been hidden there was not immediately apparent. There were plenty of stalactites, but that was it, in terms of decoration.\n\nBao\u2019er sat upon a rock, gnawing on purple mushrooms.\n\nHan Sen saw there were many other such mushrooms near the rock she sat on, and he thought they looked delicious.\n\nBut he knew the more colorful a mushroom was, the more poisonous it could be. Back in the world of the Alliance, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to eat one.\n\nSeeing Bao\u2019er happily munching away, though, he knew they couldn\u2019t have all been bad. So, he decided to try one.\n\nHe picked one up and sunk his teeth into its moist cap. Then, he ate it all. He immediately felt really cool, as a chill ran up and down his body.\n\n\u201cSacred-Geno Point +1.\u201d\n\nThat came as quite the surprise. He was more than happy, discovering the mushrooms there could provide him sacred-blood geno points.\n\nHe and Bao\u2019er then stayed there for a while, merrily chomping on as many mushrooms as they could. Over and over, the announcements popped for Han Sen.\n\nBut after downing the fifth mushroom, the announcements stopped. He couldn\u2019t receive any more sacred geno points off them.\n\nBao\u2019er continued to eat as many as she could, though. After a while, she sat back and burped. She was done, too.\n\nHan Sen decided to poke about the cave some more. It seemed rather deep, and there could be plenty of spelunking to do before he was done exploring it all.\n\n\u201cMight I be able to enter the shelter from here?\u201d Han Sen wondered to himself.\n\nIf the entrance was as well-hidden as this cave was, he imagined he would never find a way in.\n\nHe\u2019d probably have to inspect every inch of the mountain to find another not-a-wall wall that may have existed, just like the one that had led him there. Such a task would take years.\n\nThe idea of continuing to explore this cave, though, concerned Han Sen. It felt as if he could no longer make use of Dongxuan Aura.\n\nHe tried using it and felt its radius shrink down to one meter. Then, nothing. He couldn\u2019t use it at all anymore.\n\nThat must have been why he could not sense the boons the mushrooms would have provided, and only decided to eat them upon seeing Bao\u2019er enjoy them.\n\n\u201cBao\u2019er, come on. We should go deeper,\u201d Han Sen said, and so off they went.\n\nThe cave was fairly straight, without any branching pathways. The duo walked for hours, and still, there was no end in sight.\n\nThe only remarkable thing to occur on that long travel was stumbling across another variety of mushrooms.\n\nBao\u2019er was full, though, so she was not interested in eating them. Han Sen ate one, but found out they did nothing. There was no point increase.\n\nSo, he summoned Meowth and Golden Growler and got them to eat the mushrooms. He had continued feeding them waterdrops for quite some time, but it had been a while since the drops had influenced their growth. No longer did the waterdrops make them stronger.\n\nAfter some more travel, Han Sen saw a light at the end of the tunnel. He was excited to see what might be ahead, but he doubted he\u2019d find the entrance to Phoenix Shelter through that dingy cavern.\n\nWhen he exited the cave, he was back outside. Strangely, though, there were no more peaks to climb. He had emerged on the absolute mountaintop.\n\nWhen he looked down, the mountains looked like large lotus flowers. Every petal was one of the peaks. It was no wonder it had taken him a long time to reach the highest point.\n\nUpon this main peak, there was a big tree. It had to be at least a hundred meters tall, but it was dead, dried up like charcoal. It was, however, hollow.\n\nAlso of note, the tree appeared to have been chopped in half. It must have been cut by some fearsome weapon.\n\n\u201cI wonder what sort of weapon would be able to cut through this tree?\u201d Han Sen asked himself, as he examined the tree.\n\nAfter noticing the tree was hollow, Han Sen decided to check it out. The space inside was about as wide as a basketball court.\n\nLooking inside, Han Sen noticed a golden feather inside the trunk. It was there in plain sight.\n\nThe two-meter-long feather was shining gold, much like starlight. It was hot, too, even for Han Sen who was exceptionally talented when it came to dealing with fire.\n\nIt felt like metal when Han Sen touched it. And he tried lifting the feather by its hard tip.\n\nUnfortunately, despite using all his strength, he could not move it. It was frighteningly heavy."
