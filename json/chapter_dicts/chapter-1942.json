    "text": "\u201cWe need to find a way to exit this Heaven. We might have escaped for now, but there\u2019s still a chance we might be found by Seven Spirit,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cIf you do not know how to get out of here, then you should know that I don\u2019t, either,\u201d Hai\u2019er said. She thought for a moment. \u201cCan\u2019t you turn invisible? If we stay invisible, then Seven Spirit\u2019s clones won\u2019t be able to find us, will they?\u201d\n\nHan Sen shook his head. \u201cThere are limitations to remaining invisible, as I cannot keep it up for long.\u201d\n\nLittle Invisible could make Han Sen invisible, but Han Sen was carrying another person. It would be too much for him to handle. The creature was still just a baby. And after the amount of time they had spent invisible earlier, all its energy had been drained.\n\n\u201cWhat do you plan to do, then?\u201d Hai\u2019er was standing atop a dune. She scanned the desert, afraid their nemesis would return.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stand there,\u201d Han Sen told her, motioning her down from the top of the dune. Then, he said, \u201cI thought you were of the Pirate. You might just be Viscount, but you should be able to stay alive, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, of course. Even if there was a Duke on our heels, I could stay alive. But this is Seven Spirit, so I can\u2019t be entirely sure.\u201d Hai\u2019er gave a wry smile.\n\n\u201cIf it was just one clone, do you think you could make it out?\u201d Han Sen asked, after some thought.\n\n\u201cIf there was just one, then I guess I could. But my method can only protect me.\u201d Hai\u2019er looked glum, saying that.\n\n\u201cThat is enough. I will go to Seven Spirit\u2019s true self. His clones will be coming for me, but that will allow you to go back the way you came and leave. If Seven Spirit does not recall his clones, though, then you\u2019ll be on your own,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\nHai\u2019er looked at Han Sen and said, \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er hailed from the Pirate. She found it hard to believe a stranger would help her formulate a plan of escape at his own expense.\n\nHan Sen smiled and said, \u201cNo matter what reason he has for trying to kill me, he waited until only the two of us remained. That means he doesn\u2019t want others to know what he wants to do. If you make it out, perhaps he\u2019ll give up on the idea of killing me. And if he doesn\u2019t give up, at least you can spread the news of what actually happened. You could inform Knife Queen. If you can\u2019t, I\u2019ll die for nothing. Vengeance won\u2019t be sought.\u201d\n\nHan Sen paused, then went on to say, \u201cSeven Spirit is coming after me. I cannot escape, and this is the only gambit we have available.\u201d\n\nHai\u2019er looked at Han Sen for a while, and then spoke. \u201cIf I can make it out, I will inform Knife Queen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal, then. You walk east, and I\u2019ll go west.\u201d Han Sen looked at the time, and then continued. \u201cHe should be on his way back by now. Go on, and good luck.\u201d\n\nHan Sen stood up and ran to the west. Although Hai\u2019er was worried, she knew if she went along with Han Sen, she might very well die. So, she went east.\n\nHai\u2019er did not dare run too quickly, though. She was afraid Han Sen might use her as bait, so just in case, she went slowly.\n\nIf Han Sen was going west, Seven Spirit should bump into him first whenever he turned back. When that occurred, she would have her chance to escape.\n\nHan Sen was not that graceful, though. He walked west, looking around as he went.\n\nBecause he had been in that place for a while, and the music affected people a lot, it was fortunate Han Sen\u2019s will was as strong as it was. It didn\u2019t affect him as it did the others.\n\nAfter a while, Han Sen stopped walking. He looked around and buried himself inside one of the dunes. Once inside the sand, he cast Petrify to turn himself into stone. Not even a deified elite could find him there.\n\nNow, all Han Sen had to do was wait. He was going to wait until Seven Spirit came past. And when the hound did, he\u2019d emerge.\n\nIf Seven Spirit was walking slow, then Hai\u2019er should encounter a clone. If she did, she\u2019d surely attract Seven Spirit in that direction. But Han Sen wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d entice the attention of Seven Spirit himself. If Seven Spirit found out that Hai\u2019er was alone, he\u2019d still want to search for Han Sen, more than anything.\n\nHan Sen reviewed every possible way this situation could unfold, and he formulated a method for dealing with each circumstance. Suddenly, though, he felt as if a being had just walked past. He was buried under the sand, though, and he couldn\u2019t use Dongxuan Aura to be certain. He couldn\u2019t be sure that it was Seven Spirit.\n\nThe creature was slowly heading east. He had walked past where Han Sen was hiding, headed on an eastbound trajectory. Han Sen assumed it had to be Seven Spirit, since who else would walk backwards when they were this late in the game? Han Sen waited until the presence went by, hoping to head the opposite direction after Seven Spirit passed.\n\nBut Seven Spirit only walked east for a bit before turning back. He was searching for something.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, do you want to die down where you are? Or do you want to go out fighting?\u201d Seven Spirit Buddha asked.\n\nHan Sen frowned and thought, \u201cWeird. How does he know I\u2019m here?\u201d\n\nHan Sen was a little worried, but he didn\u2019t move from his position within the sand dune. If the felon knew where Han Sen was, it was likely that he\u2019d already have attacked. He wouldn\u2019t bother talking.\n\nSeven Spirit waited a bit for a response to come, but none came. He didn\u2019t actually know where Han Sen was. But it seemed as if he knew Han Sen was somewhere nearby, as he didn\u2019t leave the approximate region.\n\n\u201cHe must have a way to sense my general presence, but he can\u2019t find me. This is a tough spot to be in,\u201d Han Sen was thinking.\n\nSeven Spirit stopped. He mumbled something, and then the sand was kicked into turmoil again. The wind whipped into a raging tornado. Wherever it went, the sand flew everywhere. It dug up a thousand meters of desert.\n\n\u201cMarquises are stubborn. It must be costing a lot of power for him to keep searching that way,\u201d Han Sen thought. It also made him feel disappointment.\n\nEven if he had turned into stone, Seven Spirit would find him if he dug too deeply into the sand.\n\nHan Sen was not in a rush to move, however. He waited for the tornado to come. He wasn\u2019t going to move until he was found, in the hope that Seven Spirit would exhaust most of his energy."
