    "text": "Afterward, things got even better. The geno god list randomly opened. He was able to rely on that knife and reach the top 100. He ended up in the 80th position. He received a true god weapon and the material of a true god.\n\nAfter all that happened, he felt incredibly lucky. Burning Lamp himself found it difficult to believe.\n\n\u201cMy luck is not bad. I got a random true god weapon like this. With this god doll, that means the Buddha have another true god elite. When the oil of my lamp runs dry, I will not have to worry too much about leaving the Buddha without anyone to continue the legacy.\u201d\n\nBurning Lamp was looking at a black doll, which was as tall as him. He looked excited.\n\nThe black doll had many weird and mysterious markings. It was just standing there. It gave people the feeling that it possessed powerful magic.\n\nThat god doll was the true god weapon Burning Lamp had received. He just needed to activate the god doll for it to follow his commands in combat. The power of it was like the power of a true god elite.\n\nBut Burning Lamp was only butterfly class. He did not have enough power, so he could not keep using the god doll to fight.\n\nThe power of a true god, even if it was used for only a short amount of time, was still able to deal damage that could not be imagined.\n\nThat satisfied Burning Lamp. As long as there was a deified around, they could make use of the god doll. The duration it could be used for was all based on how much power could be put in.\n\nAlthough the time limit was short, even if Burning Lamp died, someone in the Buddha could still make use of the god doll. The Buddha could still maintain their power.\n\n\u201cWith this god doll and the cause karma knife, unless a top-class elite wants to fight the Buddha, we\u2019ll be fine. We still have the backing of the Extreme King. There won\u2019t be many changes. If we successfully refine this material\u2026\u201d Burning Lamp was looking at a 3-foot long red bone. He looked excited.\n\nThat bone was the true god material he had earned. The bone was called the Break Soul Bone. It was the arm bone of a true god xenogeneic called Break Soul Beast.\n\nBurning Lamp thought, \u201cIt is a shame to refine the causal karma knife. The Buddha have used almost all the savings of this generation. We will not be able to afford another true god weapon. We will have to put his bone into the Buddha light pool. If we let it get rinsed by the Buddha light, it will become pure in around 1,000 to 10,000 years. Perhaps then the Buddha might become very famous, and we might have the resources to create another true god weapon.\u201d He was going to put the Break Soul Bone into the Buddha light pool, but his expression suddenly changed.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s light pool was shaking. It was not just the Buddha\u2019s light pool, but the whole Buddha Kingdom was shaking. It was like an earthquake was happening.\n\nEveryone in the Buddha Kingdom felt the earthquake. The sky and ground suddenly changed color. The Buddha light that covered the Buddha Kingdom was like a candle in the wind.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Everyone in the Buddha Kingdom looked to the sky in confusion. They shockingly realized that a man was floating above Buddha Kingdom. That man was just standing in space. One of his hands was touching the Buddha light that protected the Buddha Kingdom. For centuries, the Buddha light had not been moved. Now, the man was touching it and swinging it. It was like a bubble that popped.\n\nMany Buddha elites flew into space and madly shouted at the man. \u201cHow dare you! How dare you destroy the Buddha Kingdom\u2019s Buddha light! Do you have any idea where you are?\u201d\n\nThey knew that the man was powerful and a deified elite. He was not someone they could fight. They did not dare to fight him, but they were not going to cower and act weak. They were not going to be scared because their opponent was deified. They even looked proud.\n\nThe Buddha Kingdom\u2019s elites were doing this because Burning Lamp was 80 on the geno god list. Their alpha was an elite in the geno god list, which gave them confidence. Their confidence and pride had been greatly increased.\n\nHan Sen thought it was funny. If they were saying this was Buddha Kingdom and asking him if he knew where he was, the Buddha King was very interesting.\n\n\u201cOh, I really didn\u2019t know where I was. Where is this place? Please educate me.\u201d Han Sen looked like he was smiling at the Buddha King, but he wasn\u2019t smiling.\n\n\u201cHmph! This is the Buddha Kingdom. It is where the geno god list\u2019s elite Burning Lamp Alpha rules.\u201d The Buddha elite lifted his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cThat means I have come to the right place,\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\nThe Buddha King wished to say something, but the other Buddha Kings had just arrived. When he saw Han Sen, Pure Sea King was shocked. He screamed and shouted, \u201cHan Sen!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is Han Sen. He is God\u2019s Daddy Han Sen!\u201d The other Buddha Kings were in shock.\n\nHan Sen had not joined the geno god list fight this time, but his reputation was no weaker than those that did. It was perhaps even greater.\n\nSpace Garden had many deified elites join. Although they did not get good results, many deifieds thought it was Han Sen who had created them. Thus, Han Sen\u2019s reputation was even brighter.\n\n\u201cPure Sea King, you still remember me,\u201d Han Sen coldly said.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with the Buddha?\u201d Pure Sea King forced a smile.\n\nBack when Burning Lamp stole Han Sen\u2019s knife blank and turned him into an ant, Pure Sea King had been nearby. He knew Han Sen really hated the Buddha, so he knew this was not a polite visit.\n\nYet, Pure Sea King was not scared. Han Sen was famous, but his power was not that great. Burning Lamp Alpha had just been number 80 on the geno god list, and he had beaten Pluto Peacock, which was true god class. That made Pure Sea King very proud.\n\nPlus, the Buddha belonged to the Extreme King. If Han Sen wanted trouble from the Buddha, he had to worry about the Extreme King.\n\n\u201cI am here to make you pay,\u201d Han Sen said.\n\n\u201cWe Buddha do not owe anything to anyone,\u201d Pure Sea King said with a dim look.\n\nHan Sen coldly laughed. \u201cHa! Ha! You don\u2019t owe anything? If you say that, then I will say something else. I do not want you to owe me anything. By that I mean I will make your race extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you! Is the Buddha a place where you can talk like a crazy man?\u201d Many Buddha elites were so angry and started shouting.\n\nHan Sen menacingly laughed. His fingers had strength. The protecting Buddha light, which had protected the Buddha Kingdom for a thousand years, broke like a bubble in his hands. The entire Buddha Kingdom was left exposed in space.\n\nAll the Buddha looked shocked. They fell back. Without the Buddha\u2019s light for protection, their security was reduced by 50%. They would not dare fight Han Sen.\n\n\u201cAmitabha!\u201d The Buddha\u2019s catchphrase was up. Burning Lamp was wearing Buddha clothing. He was on his way, and he was quick to arrive before Han Sen did anything else."
