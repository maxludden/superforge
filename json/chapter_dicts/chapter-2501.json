    "text": "Ice Blue Knight King was feeling very conflicted. He never thought that bringing Han Sen to the Extreme King would be the catalyst for so much trouble. If Ice Blue Knight King had a chance to do things over, he\u2019d never have taken Han Sen away from Narrow Moon.\n\nIf he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t force Han Sen to join the Extreme King. In fact, even if Han Sen had begged Ice Blue Knight King and called him grandfather, he still wouldn\u2019t take Han Sen with him. He would slap Han Sen until he fell upon the ground, then order him to remain in Narrow Moon. Han Sen could stay there and bring harm to the Rebate, Ice Blue Knight King believed. Wherever Han Sen went, he brought trouble and turmoil with him.\n\nBut it was a shame there were no do-overs in the world. So, now, Ice Blue Knight King had a massive headache pounding against his temples.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to my brain back then, when I forced him out of there?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King just wanted to slap himself in the face.\n\nHan Sen had killed a prince. He had disguised himself as a prince. He had taken treasures and power from the Extreme King. Everything Han Sen said and did made Ice Blue Knight King feel as if he was plummeting into an abyss.\n\nHe knew it was game over for him. He was the one that brought Han Sen to the Extreme King, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he got dragged into this affair. Even if his participation wasn\u2019t considered a crime, he was afraid that his career would never progress any further.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst thing he feared. He had just received another piece of news from the Extreme King. Han Sen had broken through all the chokepoints that the Extreme had set up for him, traveled the length and breadth of the Tianxia System, and reached the systems of chaos.\n\nIce Blue Knight King had no idea how Han Sen had accomplished this. He was being chased by the whole universe, but he had managed to make it to the systems of chaos. That made Ice Blue Knight King confused.\n\nRight now, Ice Blue Knight King had received an order. He had to stop Han Sen at all costs. If Han Sen made it past him, he would no longer have to show up for work. He would never serve as an Ice Blue Knight captain again.\n\nThinking about having to take his fellow Ice Blue Knights to stop Han Sen, Ice Blue Knight King felt like there was an icy fist tightening around his stomach.\n\nIce Blue Knight King had watched the live streams of Han Sen in the Tianxia System. The systems of chaos were dangerous, but it was much easier to use technology there than in the Tianxia System.\n\nHan Sen leveling up Lando to deified class surprised him. It was like a miracle performed by God. It was pretty hard to believe.\n\nThe scariest thing was that he had seen Han Sen battling on video. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to stop Han Sen, not even if he led the entire might of the Ice Blue Knights against him. He didn\u2019t think he had a snowflake\u2019s chance in hell.\n\nBut an order was an order, and Ice Blue Knight King had to follow through. If he didn\u2019t, no one would be able to save him.\n\nUsing the news he received from the Extreme King and the knowledge he already had on the systems of chaos, Ice Blue Knight King took his Ice Blue Knights to intercept Han Sen.\n\nIt worked. The beaten-up white whale was easy to spot.\n\nWhen Han Sen saw Ice Blue Knight King, he was surprised. He had intentionally avoided going close to the headquarters of the Ice Blue Knights, and still, he was intercepted.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the Extreme King now know I am in the systems of chaos. I\u2019m afraid people like Meng Lie will start showing up again soon,\u201d Han Sen thought to himself.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, if you stop and come with us to the Extreme King, things will still be alright,\u201d Ice Blue Knight said as he looked upon the battered white whale.\n\nHe watched as the white whale opened its mouth and Han Sen emerged.\n\nDespite all his recent battles, Han Sen didn\u2019t look any worse for wear. His cheeks had a healthy flush, and all-in-all, he looked quite cheery. He even had a wretched smile that would make anyone want to punch him on sight.\n\n\u201cIce Blue Knight King. How are you doing, man?\u201d Han Sen smiled and greeted Ice Blue Knight King.\n\nIce Blue Knight King gave Han Sen a strange look. He remembered the time when he had taken Han Sen away from Narrow Moon, and he could see how much he had changed since then.\n\nAt that moment, Ice Blue Knight King wished he had never seen Han Sen\u2019s face before.\n\n\u201cCome back to the Extreme King, or I will do you harm,\u201d Ice Blue Knight King said in a hard voice. The cannons and weapons were all primed and ready to fire on Han Sen.\n\nThe knights of the Ice Blue Knights were ready. All that Ice Blue Knight King had to do was give a single command, and those knights would unleash enough firepower to blow up a planet.\n\nBut facing Han Sen, Ice Blue Knight King didn\u2019t feel confident at all. So many deified beings had chased him, and yet, he had still gotten this far. He wouldn\u2019t be an easy enemy to bring down.\n\n\u201cIce Blue Knight King, I need ten cubic meters of cloud crystal stone. And I need three thousand gallons of V758 geno fluid\u2026\u201d Han Sen suddenly began listing out items that he wanted.\n\nThe Ice Blue Knights were shocked. They didn\u2019t know what Han Sen meant. They were going to fight, so why was he making demands?\n\n\u201cHe wants those items he just listed?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King thought in confusion. This was ridiculous.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King looked expressionlessly at Han Sen.\n\n\u201cIt means hurry up and get me what I asked for. I will give you three hours,\u201d Han Sen said in annoyance.\n\nIce Blue Knight King and the other Ice Blue Knights thought this was ridiculous. Han Sen was wanted by the Extreme King, but now he was giving them a store list and a deadline. This was hilarious.\n\n\u201cHan Sen, have you gone insane, or am I going senile? We are the Ice Blue Knights. We are a powerful force that serves the Extreme King. The glorious name of the Ice Blue Knights is known far and wide, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Save your breath and go get my things. You have two hours and fifty-eight minutes.\u201d Han Sen interrupted Ice Blue Knight King and clapped his hands.\n\nAt that moment, Ice Blue Knight King saw two other people emerge from the white whale. Both of them were King class creatures, and between them, they were carrying a limp form.\n\nThe person they were carrying looked really bad. He was beaten and swollen. His clothes were drenched in blood, and his bones were like mush. He couldn\u2019t stand by himself. Two Kings stood to his left and right, holding him upright.\n\nIce Blue Knight King recognized who it was, and his mouth went dry. He looked at Han Sen, then back at the other person with disbelief.\n\n\u201cBai Wuchang\u2026 King Bai\u2019s favorite son\u2026 God, what did Han Sen do?\u201d Ice Blue Knight King thought. His mind felt empty.\n\nKilling Prince Sixteen wasn\u2019t enough, it seemed. Han Sen had now taken King Bai\u2019s favorite son Bai Wuchang hostage. He had also beaten him to a pulp. Ice Blue Knight King couldn\u2019t imagine that anyone but Han Sen was capable of such a thing.\n\n\u201cYou have two hours and fifty-five minutes. If I don\u2019t get all the things I want on time, I will cut his head off.\u201d Han Sen grabbed Bai Wuchang\u2019s hair and looked at Ice Blue Knight, who was currently in a stupor."
