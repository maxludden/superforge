They were a mixture of young and old people, and there were about two hundred people in total. They were sluggish and in disarray, and upon closer inspection, many were wounded. Some had been more grievously injured than others, with many having lost entire limbs. It was a horrifying scene.\n\n\u201cUncle San, are we going to make it?\u201d a young woman asked an elderly person, as she rode upon a unicorn.\n\n\u201cYes, we are,\u201d the old man answered her with absolute certainty.\n\nThey were surpassers, hailing from Wind God Shelter. They were once incredibly strong, and one of them had even opened eight gene locks. They had conquered royal shelters for years.\n\nBut this legacy was brought to its knees upon the arrival of a powerful spirit. Thousands of people had died in the sudden siege, and only two hundred had made it out alive.\n\nThe man who had opened eight gene locks, and many other brave warriors, remained behind to stall the spirit that attacked them. They gave their lives so others could escape.\n\nBut fleeing to the wilds was not a guarantee of safety for anyone. It was often a crueler fate, and this mountain was not someplace anyone could take refuge. This was a place not even an army of spirits would dare go, and so the small group\u2019s chances of survival were nearly nil.\n\nBut these people did not know this. Still, they remained wary, just as much as they were weary. It was a foreign land, and they had to maintain vigilance.\n\nEven if they crossed the mountain successfully, there was no guarantee fonder pastures awaited them on the other side. The area past the mountain was most likely controlled by spirits, as well.\n\nWith nowhere specific to run, and with no idea what fate might soon await them, all they could do was give in to the whims of their feet. They traveled with no destination in mind, in a simple escape of the horrors behind them, in a desperate hope that no more would lie ahead.\n\nLin Weiwei did not ask again. As kind as her uncle\u2019s few words were, she had just been hesitant to accept the truth of what was most likely to happen. She wanted at least one comforting thought, but their reserves were empty and there was no comfort to be had. Whether any of them would survive was now in the fickle hands of destiny.\n\nAfter another two days of harsh passage, they encountered more than a fair share of creatures. Two more people fell in battle with them, and they were still in what could be regarded as the foothills of the mountain. As they went deeper, they knew crueler monstrosities would soon appear.\n\n\u201cCareful; we have movement to the left,\u201d someone said, which drew their attention there.\n\n\u201cPrepare for battle!\u201d Uncle San rallied, whose actual name was Lin He. After his command, silence gripped the air again. Then came the sounds of rustling. It drew nearer and nearer.\n\nSweat and fear choked the hearts of those who waited for whatever foul beast would emerge and waylay them.\n\nA shadow started to form in the foliage, and with their weapons in hand, they prepared to fight.\n\nBut when this shadow came closer, the dark figure began to take shape. It was a person, strangely. It was a twenty-year-old man with skin that was smoother than any fair maiden.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the person\u2019s manly face and strong, wide body, he could have very well been mistaken for a woman.\n\nWhen they saw another human approach, relief captured their hearts. Someone yelled, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? You should stick with the team!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not one of us. And how can a baby exist here, in the Third God\u2019s Sanctuary?\u201d When Lin He said this, the warmth of relief evaporated in a sudden tug. Their nervousness was amplified once more.\n\nThe people realized that they did not recognize this man, and a baby was asleep sucking her finger. The sight unnerved them.\n\nHumans could not enter a sanctuary before they were sixteen years old. Only death would await them, if they tried. If this was true, how could one survive there?\n\n\u201cKill him! He is not human, and this is a trick.\u201d When a person commanded this, bows were raised and aimed at the shadowy figure.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d The man with a baby in one arm, raised his other with the plea.\n\n\u201cRenounce that forked-tongue, and spare us any lies you wish to conjure. Attack this wicked fiend!\u201d With these words, arrows were nocked and strings were drawn.\n\nThe refugees were on edge, and they had every right to be. With this person appearing from out of nowhere, in possession of a strange baby, they struggled to believe it to be an actual human.\n\n\u201cStop, he is one of us!\u201d Lin Weiwei leapt off her unicorn and stopped the barrage of arrows that was about to be loosed.\n\n\u201cOne of us?! You don\u2019t even know him,\u201d someone asked.\n\n\u201cI know him. And if you can\u2019t recognize his appearance, then his name is one you must certainly be familiar with,\u201d Lin Weiwei said.\n\n\u201cAre you certain? You know who this man is?\u201d Lin He asked, as no one dared to lower their bows.\n\n\u201cThis is President Ji\u2019s son-in-law, Han Sen,\u201d Lin Weiwei said.\n\nLin Weiwei was Lin Feng\u2019s auntie. They had once met a long time ago, in a conference held by the four families of Lin, Xue, Ji, and Wang.\n\n\u201cHe is Han Sen?\u201d Lin He asked, in disbelief.\n\n\u201cAsk him, if you do not believe me,\u201d Lin Weiwei said snidely.\n\nBefore Lin He could ask, Han Sen broke the silence. He asked, \u201cSister Wei, how is Lin Feng?\u201d\n\nA vat of relief washed over Lin He. It was immediately comforting for him to learn this person knew Lin Weiwei and Lin Feng, who was still in the Second God\u2019s Sanctuary.\n\n\u201cNot bad. But now is not the time for idle chit-chat. Do you care to tell me why you are out here, on Ghost Mountain? And where in the sanctuaries did this baby come from?\u201d Lin Weiwei asked.\n\nEveryone was still in a state of alarm, so Han Sen stepped forward to be friendlier and ease some of the tension out of the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cA creature chased me here whilst I was out hunting. Oh, and it\u2019s not an actual baby. It\u2019s a humanoid pet. I\u2019m still growing it.\u201d Han Sen smiled.\n\nHan Sen wished to say something more, but a sudden scream erupted from the front of the team. It was a wretched plea for aid, and when they turned to look, they saw a surpasser burning to cinders."
