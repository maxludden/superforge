    "text": "Kiek\u2019s magnetic area wasn\u2019t the strongest King area in the Extreme King, but he was still a member of the third-highest race in the universe. His Magnet King Body was nothing to take lightly, especially since he was half-deified. Normal King class xenogeneics were unable to walk under the influence of his magnetic area.\n\nBao\u2019er was just a kid, and she was somehow ignoring Kiek\u2019s magnetic area. That surprised him a lot.\n\nHe hesitated, then raised a palm. A black magnetic light appeared in his hand. He wanted to attack Bao\u2019er who was still driving the white whale.\n\n\u201cMister\u2026 please\u2026 I beg you\u2026 don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d\n\nAs Kiek was about to launch the magnetic light at Bao\u2019er, a woman suddenly stood up. Straining against the might of the magnetic area, she stood before Bao\u2019er and spoke with a trembling voice.\n\n\u201cYou can move inside my magnetic area? You aren\u2019t bad.\u201d Kiek stared at her. He decided that he would need to get rid of her first. But the woman suddenly kneeled on the floor and bowed before him.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me!\u201d she pleaded from her knees. \u201cPlease, let us go! We are just useless women. We can\u2019t stop whatever it is you want to do. Please let us go as easily as you would release a fart.\u201d\n\nNing Yue kept begging, all the while repeatedly banging her head on the ground.\n\n\u201cLeave if you don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Kiek told her in a hard voice. He was quite famous in the Extreme King, and he wouldn\u2019t bother killing a woman if she was behaving like this.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, yes. We will leave now!\u201d Ning Yue got up and started to pull Bao\u2019er away with her.\n\nPang!\n\nThe magnetic light hit Ning Yue in the face. Ning Yue was sent flying.\n\nThe powerful magnetic force drug Ning Yue across the ship and flung her into one of the ship\u2019s walls. Her face smacked into the wall and stuck to it. She couldn\u2019t pull herself away.\n\n\u201cYou can leave by yourself. She stays.\u201d Kiek cast another magnetic light toward Bao\u2019er.\n\nPang!\n\nSomehow, Ning Yue had reappeared in front of Bao\u2019er. She crossed her arms to block the magnet this time, and the sudden weight made her arms feel so heavy. They were sucked straight down to the floor. Her face smacked into the floor, and her mouth twisted.\n\n\u201cMister, please let her go! She\u2019s just a kid, and I promised Han Sen I would protect his child.\u201d Ning Yue was lying on the floor in an awkward position. She cried freely, snot and tears running down her face.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if you really do want to die,\u201d Kiek grunted, generating a magnetic light in his fist.\n\nNing Yue\u2019s pants suddenly became hot, and a puddle appeared on the floor. She had peed herself.\n\nWhen Kiek smelled the urine, he frowned. He might get his hands dirty if he killed a woman like this. Ignoring Ning Yue, he turned his attention back to Bao\u2019er again. The magnetic light in his hands was so bright that it was like a black sun.\n\nBao\u2019er was still operating the white whale, guiding it to fight the Extreme King knights outside. She acted as if she had yet to see Kiek there.\n\nKiek\u2019s lips pressed into a thin line, and he prepared to throw the magnetic light at Bao\u2019er. Ning Yue was pressed against the floor with her limbs shaking, but she still managed to crawl toward Kiek. When she was near his feet, she begged, \u201cMister, please let us go. We won\u2019t get in the way of whatever you want to do! And I can do anything for you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGet lost, you dirty b*tch!\u201d Kiek kicked Ning Yue in the face, the force of the blow sending her flying.\n\nPang!\n\nNing Yue hit the airship\u2019s wall, her face covered in blood. Her entire body was stuck to the wall, keeping her from falling.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then shut the hell up! If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll kill you. You\u2019re disturbing my work,\u201d Kiek snarled. He stared at Bao\u2019er again and tried to launch another magnetic light.\n\n\u201cI want you to stop!\u201d Ning Yue\u2019s voice was shaking as if she was on the verge of bursting into tears.\n\nKiek glanced at her struggling form, but she couldn\u2019t free herself from the wall. The magnetic force had her pinned to the wall like a slab of meat.\n\nIgnoring Ning Yue, he sent the magnetic light in his hands toward Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cStop! I told you to stop!\u201d Ning Yue screamed with fear. Her body managed to tear through the magnetic power, and she leaped in front of Bao\u2019er to take the black sun-like light.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe scary magnetic light landed on Ning Yue, and in the next instant, her body crashed to the floor like a crumbling mountain. Her limbs were held down by an iron grip, all crushed and broken-looking.\n\nKiek ignored her. He continued summoning his magnetic power.\n\n\u201cStop, I\u2019m begging you! Don\u2019t hurt her\u2026 I promised Han Sen I would take care of his daughter! I made him a promise\u2026\u201d Ning Yue wept helplessly from her place on the floor.\n\nSeeing that Kiek was going to cast that magnetic light at Bao\u2019er, Ning Yue struggled with the urge to get up. But she had been hit by the magnetic forces three times. The force was now too strong for her to overcome.\n\nKiek cast another sun-like magnetic light at Bao\u2019er.\n\n\u201cI told you to stop!\u201d Ning Yue shrieked, looking at the magnetic light that was flying toward Bao\u2019er. Her shaking body erupted with green flames that wrapped her up in a shroud of fire.\n\nIn those green flames, Ning Yue\u2019s eyes suddenly calmed. His face and body regained their masculine shape. He looked like a man again.\n\nFang Qing Yu and the pirates on the floor stared at Ning Yue with wide eyes. They thought Ning Yue was a chickenhearted and useless woman. But suddenly, she had just become a man. And the green fire around him burned and wisped in an unsettling way.\n\n\u201cI told you to stop! Are you deaf?\u201d Ning Yue thundered, his eyes crystal clear. His face still had the dried tracks of tears and snot. His female garments had started to burst at the seams as he became bigger, but he still looked gentle and soft.\n\n\u201cYou dare to play tricks on someone like me? You\u2019re dead!\u201d Kiek\u2019s hand gathered up a black light. It became a black magnetic knife that came for Ning Yue.\n\nNing Yue looked calm and composed, and his hands held a green sword. When Kiek swung his black magnetic knife there, Ning Yue\u2019s body was attracted to it. He flew for the magnetic knife.\n\nKatcha!\n\nThe moment Ning Yue was sucked into the black magnetic knife, he waved his little green sword. A green sword light shot by, sending Kiek\u2019s head and half of his magnetic knife soaring through the air.\n\nPatong!\n\nKiek\u2019s headless body crumpled to the ground. Fang Qing Yu and the others were frozen.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d On the other side, the green flames on Ning Yue\u2019s body had vanished. His little green sword was on the floor, and his body returned to a feminine shape again. When she saw that headless body, Ning Yue held her face and started to scream. She looked so scared, and she frantically stepped away from the corpse."
