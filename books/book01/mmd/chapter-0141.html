<p>“I did not expect that a cheater could actually be admitted to
Blackhawk. Has the school lowered its standards?” Ji Yanran thought
as she walked and made no connection between Han Sen and
My-Girlfriend-Is-Ji-Yanran.</p>
<p>In her mind, Han Sen was a cheater and nowhere near a
master.</p>
<p>Soon, Ji Yanran saw Han Sen was behind her, so she turned around
and frowned at him. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I’m going back to my dorm. You think I’m following you?” Han
Sen rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Which department are you in? Where is your dorm?” Ji Yanran
refused to believe him.</p>
<p>“Archery Department, Building E10 Room 304.” Han Sen smiled at
her.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran paused, for Han Sen’s dormitory was really this way.
And the building where Han Sen lived was right behind her
building.</p>
<p>“Archery Department, no wonder you can be admitted to Blackhawk.
Cheater in games and cheater in the entrance exam,” Ji Yanran
said.</p>
<p>“Why are you treating your boyfriend like this?” said Han Sen
helplessly.</p>
<p>“You can save that comment when you could beat me, cheater,” Ji
Yanran said.</p>
<p>“Piece of cake. I can do it now if you wish.” Han Sen was a
little annoyed by being called a cheater.</p>
<p>“Want to cheat again?” Ji Yanran said with disdain.</p>
<p>Hansen was speechless. “You said I cheated, and refused to let
me prove it to you. What do you want?”</p>
<p>“If you really have what it takes, we could have a match on the
professional holographic training machine tomorrow,” Ji Yanran said
confidently.</p>
<p>“Well, give me your comlink number. I’ll contact you tomorrow,”
Han Sen smiled and said.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran rolled her eyes, “Don’t try to get my number. Tomorrow
afternoon at three o’clock, I will wait for you in Building E16
Room 138.”</p>
<p>“Well, I will go. Wait to become my girlfriend.” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran did not talk to him again and walked away.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, when Han Sen was ready to go, Qin Xuan
suddenly gave him an order to go back to Steel Armor Shelter for an
important task.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to give up the plan to meet Ji Yanran and teleported
to Steel Armor Shelter.</p>
<p>Although he would like to inform Ji Yanran, she did not tell him
her number, so he had no way to do it.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran went there at three o’clock and waited, but saw no one
there. She was even more convinced that he was a cheater.</p>
<p>Han Sen came back after two days, and there was still no way to
contact Ji Yanran. He did not worry about it too much and continued
to study according to his own plan.</p>
<p>“Everyone, I have something to say.” Fatty cleared his throat
and said, holding a stack of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>“President, we can hear you,” replied Shi as he was training on
a holographic machine.</p>
<p>Other people were also doing their own thing. Feeling helpless,
Fatty said, “In a few days, Starry Cup will begin and as a society
of warframe, we must register for some warframe items. Let’s see
which ones we should go for.”</p>
<p>“You are the president. You decide,” Lu Meng had nothing to
contribute.</p>
<p>Zhang Yang was zealous, “Of course all of them.”</p>
<p>“The number of our members would not even cover all the items.”
Wang Mengmeng blinked her eyes and said.</p>
<p>“We are the Heavy Warframe Society, so we will fall short to the
Warframe Society in many items,” Li Zhenzhen said.</p>
<p>Wang Chun added, “For the items in combat, we will not do well.
And we haven’t even practiced the five-on-five team combat and will
be much worse than the Warframe Society.”</p>
<p>“That is challenging, but as long as we unite as one, we will be
able to win.” Zhang Yang was full of self-confidence.</p>
<p>Fatty looked to Wang Mengmeng, “Which ones should we apply
for?”</p>
<p>Wang Mengmeng looked at Han Sen who was reading, “Brother Han,
what do you say?”</p>
<p>“That Starry Cup, what is in it for the champion?” Han Sen
pondered and asked.</p>
<p>Skinny quickly said, “Of course. The prize depends on the item
and all top 3 will get something. Of course, the champion’s prize
is the best. For example, all members of the champion team of the
five-on-five combat will gain a warframe of the Starbeast series,
which was worth more than a million each. The champion of the
single combat will win the lastest warframe of the King series,
which has a value of nearly ten million.”</p>
<p>“There are prizes for the top 3 of all items. We should try our
best. Even if we don’t win anything, it would be a great
opportunity for us to practice,” Fatty said.</p>
<p>“Let’s register for all then.” Han Sen heard there were so many
awards paid by Starry Group and decided to try.</p>
<p>“For real?” Fatty looked to Wang Mengmeng again.</p>
<p>“If Brother Han says so.” Wang Mengmeng thought about it and
asked, “It there any overlaps between these items? Can one show up
in all of them?”</p>
<p>Fatty checked the schedule and said, “There is no problem other
than one item, which is a single item, so one of us could go for
that.”</p>
<p>“Well then. Our president will take care of the registration.”
Wang Mengmeng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Mengmeng, will this work? Our society has so few people, and
almost all of us are freshmen. Would it look too bad if we lost in
everything?” Li Zhenzhen said with some concern.</p>
<p>“It does not matter. With Brother Han here, we will not lose.”
Wang Mengmeng had blind trust in Han Sen.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhen and Wang Chun cast an odd look to Han Sen. They
could not tell what was so special about this freshman that Wang
worshiped him so much.</p>
<p>They had also asked Wang Mengmeng about it and Wang simply said
she had known him all her life and he had always been an impressive
person.</p>
<p>But Li Zhenzhen and Wang Chun were quite skeptical about it,
since they had not seen any excellent performance from him.</p>
<p>And Han Sen had been practicing on heavy warframes instead of
combat warframes these days, so it would be unrealistic to say he
would get any prize.</p>
