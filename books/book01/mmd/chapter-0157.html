<p>The gorgeous killing feast had just begun.</p>
<p>Silver Killer was moving quickly with the powerful Destroyer
behind it. The crazy killing made one warframe after another
explode. People were almost trembling watching the fragments of
warframes sent in the air by gunfire.</p>
<p>Scattered attacks were aiming at Silver Killer, which seemed to
be able to predict and avoid all the trajectory of the gunfire. It
not only avoided all the attacks, but was also rapidly approaching
the warframe crowd.</p>
<p>“Fire! Do not let him approach.”</p>
<p>“Damn! Do not fire. Are you all stupid?”</p>
<p>“Everyone, follow my command.”</p>
<p>“Kill that bastard.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me say ‘follow my command’?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Using the fairy queen, Han Sen could see all the warframes and
the movements of their guns. With the strong horsepower of Silver
Killer and Han Sen’s excellent operation, he managed to avoid all
the attacks.</p>
<p>No. Rather, Han Sen was deliberately leading the opponents to
attack where he wanted.</p>
<p>If the opponents was a real army and there was a real commander,
Han Sen and Silver Killer would have been killed a million
times.</p>
<p>But luckily, they were but a group of students who had no real
experience at war. In addition, they did not come from the same
society and many never even worked together before.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Destroyer was finally finished off. Wang Mengmeng’s level of
operation was really bad. All she could do was to stand the
Destroyer still and use its automatic firing system.</p>
<p>But that was enough for Han Sen. When the Destroyer was wrecked,
Han Sen was already less than 30 feet away from his opponents.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The particle submachine gun ejected bullets, which penetrated
and disabled a warframe. Then Silver Killer waltzed away from the
intense gunfire and accelerated into the crowd.</p>
<p>The real killing officially started.</p>
<p>Silver Killer was like an excellent hunter in the forest,
hunting the other warframes as it wished.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>With each of the gun shot, one warframe would be disabled or hit
in the engine.</p>
<p>Like a devil, Silver Killer was harvesting the lives of the
warframes.</p>
<p>“Do not let him run!”</p>
<p>“Damn, who hit me? Do not shoot if you don’t know how.”</p>
<p>“Are you all idiots? Mover over.”</p>
<p>“You are the idiot. Are you blind?”</p>
<p>“I asked you to follow my command!”</p>
<p>“Those bastards are unreliable. Let’s go near him and get it
over with.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Go!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Silver Killer’s killed like Satin and moved like a ghost. The
other warframes were moving in a clumsy way like heavy warframes in
comparison.</p>
<p>People who were watching the game were dumbfounded. The stadium
was quiet, as they were shocked how incredible Silver Killer was
acting.</p>
<p>It was a killing machine in its true sense. Each of its bullets
could hit the vital part with unbelievable accuracy. It was
breathtaking to see someone capable of destroying one warframe with
each shot while backing off and avoiding all the gunfire.</p>
<p>The Skynet viewers were also silent. There were few comments.
Only Fang Mingquan’s voice was non-stop.</p>
<p>“Silver Killer… again…”</p>
<p>“Beautiful shooting… beautiful movement…”</p>
<p>“Impeccable… impeccable operation and tactics… This is the star
in the Alliance… I don’t have words for his gorgeous
operation…”</p>
<p>“Well-done…beautiful…”</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful performance… Han Sen and his Silver Killer
showed us how a warframe can be operated…”</p>
<p>“In the next few years, Blackhawk will occupy an important
position in the Military Academy League Game, just because there is
this one person. With him, Blackhawk will be the undisputed
champion!”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A warframe finally approached Silver Killer, which suddenly
threw the submachine gun in the air and drew a laser sword from its
back, cutting the offending warframe in half. The it still had time
to put the sword back and catch the gun, shooting another
approaching warframe in the energy tank.</p>
<p>“My God, this guy must be an alien,” Fang Mingquan roared
excitedly, using all his enthusiasm and strength. This was his job,
his favorite job.</p>
<p>“Fucking A!”</p>
<p>“Who said Silver Killer was the only reason for his victory. He
is a master himself.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, what a victory! Starry Group will be humiliated. They
tried to set him up and still failed.”</p>
<p>“A star in the Military Academy League Game!”</p>
<p>“Wow! Is it a warframe veteran playing actually?”</p>
<p>“No way! The players are all sitting inside the holographic
simulation machine.”</p>
<p>“Really cool! I want to see the sponsors’ expressions.”</p>
<p>“Silver Killer is a very high-end warframe. Ordinary warframes
could not go like that. Their power and flexibility could not reach
this level.”</p>
<p>“I also want to know where to buy Silver Killer.”</p>
<p>The Skynet was exploding. Fang Mingquan’s live was being watched
by more than 30 million people. Many people who were watching other
divisions’ games also switched to this show after hearing about
this match.</p>
<p>“Wow, you are sure this is not an official commercial of that
warframe?”</p>
<p>“So hot!”</p>
<p>“That is the Silver Killer! Awesome.”</p>
<p>At this time, in the monitoring room, Zhao Nengtiam was sizzling
with anger. His fingers were squeezing his tea cup so hard that
they became pale.</p>
<p>“Bastard! Useless crap!” Zhao Nengtian smashed the cup in wrath,
his body shaking.</p>
