<p>After returning home, Han Sen showed Yan the tutorial of Holy
Angel and asked her to memorize it.</p>
<p>With the holographic demonstration, it was not difficult to
learn. Being intelligent, Yan memorized Holy Angel after watching
just a few times.</p>
<p>On the next day, the geno solution compatible with Holy Angel
was delivered to their home by the staff of Saint Hall. Han Sen
asked Yan to drink it in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<p>Because practicing hyper geno arts could generate a burden on
one’s body and each hyper geno art had different effects, most
hyper geno arts would have to be practiced along with the using of
its correspondent geno solution.</p>
<p>An S-Class hyper geno art usually came with three bottles of
geno solution, so it could be practiced by up to three persons.</p>
<p>If the matching geno solution was not used, Saint Hall would be
exempt from any obligations and medical bills if there was an
accident during the practice.</p>
<p>Before this, Han Sen did not know how advanced hyper geno arts
worked, so he felt lucky that he had successfully practiced
Jadeskin.</p>
<p>“Yan, this hyper geno art is the secret of our family. Do not
let others know about it, OK?” Han Sen did not even tell Yan the
name “Holy Angel.”</p>
<p>Han Yan nodded seriously, “Yan will not tell anyone that I
practiced a hyper geno art my brother gave me.”</p>
<p>“Good girl. If you encounter some danger and someone asks you
which hyper geno art you are practicing, tell him you do not know
and it’s taught to you by your brother,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Yan understands,” Han Yan said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Excellent.” Han Sen patted Han Yan’s head, feeling pity for his
sister.</p>
<p>Children who grew up in poor families were better prepared to
deal with problems. Han Sen had spent some care-free years when he
was a child. When Han Yan was born, however, their family had been
declining, so she had never lived a good life. For this, she was
more mature than her peers.</p>
<p>Luo Sulan was in Second God’s Sanctuary these days and just
returned home on the fourth day since Han Sen came back.</p>
<p>Han Sen also showed Luo Sulan Holy Angel, which shocked her.
Although she didn’t know too much about hyper geno arts, she could
tell that this was no ordinary stuff as the tutorial was very
carefully arranged.</p>
<p>“Sen, where did this hyper geno art come from?” asked Luo Sulan,
worried.</p>
<p>“Mom, don’t worry. I bought this,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“How is possible that you have this kind of money?” she asked
again.</p>
<p>“Mom, I am much stronger than before and have joined a military
gang in Steel Armor Shelter. This hyper geno art is just a start.
We will live better in the future…”Han Sen explained how he joined
Qin Xuan’s Steel Armor Gang, reassuring his mother.</p>
<p>“Son, you have gone far.” Luo Sulan’s eyes were wet from
happiness. She had endured so many hardships to see this day.</p>
<p>“Mom, don’t get emotional. It’s a good thing.” Han Sen had more
than a million left in his account after paying for the S-level
package for Yan. He gave it to his mother and said, “This is what I
earned in God’s Sanctuary recently. Mom you can use it to pay for
the daily expenses.”</p>
<p>“You take it yourself. You need the money…” Luo Sulan refused to
take it.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I am now with a military organization and my boss is
generous. There will be more in the future.” Hansen was trying to
prepare Luo Sulan for more good news.</p>
<p>“Sen, keep in mind that you shall never be aggressive. Don’t get
involved in any trouble…” Luo Sulan said earnestly.</p>
<p>“Mom, I understand. You know your son. I have always been
low-key,” Han Sen quickly said.</p>
<p>“Good, good. As for the hyper geno art, you’ve got Yan started,
right? Tell her never to show it off, in case people would be
envious.” Since father’s accident, Han Sen’s mother had changed a
lot and was constantly afraid that her children would be in
danger.</p>
<p>“Mom, do not worry. I have told Yan and she promised me she
would never tell.”</p>
<p>“No, I have to personally tell her again.” Luo Sulan got up and
went to find Yan.</p>
<p>Watching Luo Sulan leaving, Han Sen felt very upset. If it were
not for Dad’s accident, Luo Sulan wouldn’t have become so cautious
and live in panic all day along.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Han Sen regretted that he was so young and
didn’t understand anything. All he knew was that Dad had an
accident.</p>
<p>He had asked Mom and Mr. Zhang, but they were both hesitant to
say anything. Han Sen knew it was not just an accident.</p>
<p>In the stationmaster’s office at the teleport station, Yang
Manli placed a capsule in front of Qin Xuan.</p>
<p>“Stationmaster, you are sure you want to use this?” Yang Manli
looked at Qin Xuan who had picked up the capsule.</p>
<p>“I have to know why he is not willing to go to Blackhawk, and
whether he wants to join my squad,” Qin Xuan said.</p>
<p>“There are so many guys like him: cowardly, greedy and
lecherous. There is no need to win him over. I think we should make
every effort to get Dollar on our side instead, who can become the
best archer possible,” Yang Manli said.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan just smiled. “Dollar is of course amazing, but a man
like him would not give us any chance to control him. Han Sen is
still very talented, and I think he can do well. But the person I
need must have a clean slate and be willing to join my squad, which
takes me some effort to confirm.”</p>
<p>Yang Manli wanted to say more but Qin Xuan stopped her, “Unless
you can get Dollar to join our squad, Han Sen is my choice.”</p>
<p>Yang Manli did not reply, but was secretly determined to find
Dollar and persuade him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what Qin Xuan saw in him that she wanted
him to join her squad so bad. Before he entered the teleport
station, he made sure that he wasn’t in Qin Xuan’s sight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing could go unnoticed under her nose.</p>
<p>Looking at Qin Xuan standing in front of him with a faint smile
on her face, Han Sen had to step forward.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since we fought. Show me your progress.”
Noticing Qin Xuan did not mention other matters, Han Sen was
secretly relieved.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now much better, but he did not dare to show her all
he got. Even if he did, she would probably still beat him.</p>
<p>“Drink some water.” Qin Xuan took off her helmet and fetched two
bottles of water. She unscrewed a bottle for herself and handed
another to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no suspicion and drank from the sealed bottle of
water.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you think I’m pretty?” Qin Xuan suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Pretty… of course you are…” Han Sen was surprised and looked up
at her, not understanding why she was asking this question. It was
not her style.</p>
<p>“Do you think my lips are prettier or my eyes?” Qin Xuan asked
again.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt dizzy. He could not help but look to the mouth of
Qin Xuan, and gradually his sight moved up and fell on her bright
eyes.</p>
