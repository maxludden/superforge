<p>Some journalists felt that the boy looked familiar, but none
could think of who he was.</p>
<p>Everyone’s attention was on the silver box.</p>
<p>The silver box rustled and turned into silver liquid, winding up
the boy’s body.</p>
<p>In the incredulous look of the audience, the silver liquid
turned into the parts of a warframe and armed the boy.</p>
<p>“Silver Killer… It is Silver Killer…” Finally someone recognized
it.</p>
<p>And at this moment, SKTS drew a laser sword and a particle gun,
moving toward the Shura warframes like a ghost.</p>
<p>In the explosion, the sound of metal on metal, the sparks, and
the gunfire, Silver Killer was killing away. Facing Shura
warframes, Silver Killer was like a proud warrior, declaring to the
Shuras that humans were the true owner of the land.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The laser sword was broken. The particle gun ran out of energy
and was thrown at a Shura warframe. With its ammunition exhausted,
Silver Killer was still faced with endless enemies.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by the incredible visual effect. It was
even better than a movie.</p>
<p>But the next scene was even more thrilling.</p>
<p>From the bombarded school, the students rushed out one after
another, each holding a silver box engraved “TS.”</p>
<p>When the box was turned on, all of them were covered in silver
warframes, which then launched fierce attacks on the Shura
army.</p>
<p>Warfare between Shura and human was displayed with passionate
background music, motivating each audience to join.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The last frame was focused on the first silver warframe, which
blew away a Shura that was trying to attack the girl. The lens was
zoomed in on the “TS” engraved on the breastplate of the warframe
in the end.</p>
<p>A line showed up slowly, with a low male voice reading, “SKTS by
Digang, September 10, Di Garden.”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence when all the journalists looked at the
screen with a blank look, Liu Changming appeared once again on the
stage. The journalists were raising questions like crazy.</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, is that a real warframe shown in the commercial?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, can a warframe really be compressed into such a small
case?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, has any special effect been used in the video?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, is SKTS the same warframe that appeared on the Starry
Cup?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Liu, that boy driving SKTS must be that Blackhawk student
disqualified by Starry Group, right?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Liu Changming lifted his hands to quiet the room down and said
quietly, “See you on September 10.”</p>
<p>And then he did not say one extra word before leaving under the
escort of security personnel.</p>
<p>The whole Alliance was in a heated discussion of SKTS. And the
commercial had gone viral.</p>
<p>“Shit! That cannot be real!”</p>
<p>“Must all be special effects.”</p>
<p>“How can it be special effects? It will be sold on the
10th…”</p>
<p>“So Silver Killer was the latest super biological warframe SKTS.
No wonder it was not on the market—it had not been launched
yet.”</p>
<p>“Starry Group is rubbish to disqualify the student. How is this
a warframe for military use? Everything is clear now.”</p>
<p>“Digang deserves the hype. Amazing stuff!”</p>
<p>“If it really works like this, I need one in my life.”</p>
<p>“I had decided to buy ten when I saw Han Sen at the Starry
Cup.”</p>
<p>“Come on! They have said it is a limited edition. It is still in
question whether you could snag one, let alone ten.”</p>
<p>“Digang is playing dirty by showing a virtual image as its
selling point. A shame on the military business.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Digang rubbish.”</p>
<p>“Yu Qianxun is gorgeous. She has changed her style too.”</p>
<p>“Yes! She is so beautiful. I did not expect she could also
perform such a role. A true goddess.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s operation skills are top-notch as ever.”</p>
<p>“Can’t wait for September 10 to come. I’m so eager to get my
hands on this.”</p>
<p>“On September 10 Digang will be humiliated by its own lie. How
can we produce something like this with our current tech?”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, I am a Blackhawk student. That is our genius there.”</p>
<p>“The genius is a big shot now, being the new face of
Digang.”</p>
<p>“He must have always been their spokesperson. Before the new
warframe was rumored to be launched, he had used an SKTS
already.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>SKTS was a total hit. All kinds of experts were analyzing if it
was possible to make such a product.</p>
<p>Some experts supported Digang, while some snorted, thinking it
was merely a stunt.</p>
<p>The debate was endless and before SKTS was officially sold, the
result would remain in suspense, which worked in Digang’s favor,
because either way, SKTS had enjoyed unparalleled popularity.</p>
<p>And Digang also released the news about the Digang Warframe
Match on September 10, the top three of which could each win an
SKTS provided by Digang.</p>
<p>But the applicants needed to be unevolved to be eligible.</p>
<p>Only a few minutes past the announced application time, the
application sites on the Skynet were almost out of capacity.</p>
