<p>“Buddy, what’s your name?” Lin Beifeng threw a lighter at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” Han Sen caught the lighter and lit the cigarette.
Made from the tobacco produced from Schwarzwald, the cigarettes
were harmless to the body and especially refreshing.</p>
<p>For those who were risking their lives in God’s Sanctuary, the
Schwarzwald cigarettes were definitely heaven-sent.</p>
<p>“Sen, trust me, when we are back at the shelter, you can have as
much money as you want. Problems that can be solved by money are no
problems for me…”</p>
<p>They chatted for awhile, and Han Sen understood what had
happened. Lin Beifeng was not only rich, but super rich. He was
also lucky to be assigned to a shelter where he had very close
acquaintances. So he bought a whole lot of mutant beast souls:
armor, weapons, mounts, fighters, etc. He also hired a group of
people to hunt with him, wanting to hunt a sacred-blood creature.
With his great luck, they indeed caught a sacred-blood creature,
but what happened after was not so lucky. The people he hired
either died or escaped, and he just went running into the
mountains. After all sorts of danger, he had managed to survive,
but lost almost all the beast souls he bought. If it was not for
Han Sen, he would have been killed by the mammo beasts.</p>
<p>“Sen, how far is our Glory Shelter from here?” asked Lin
Beifeng.</p>
<p>“It’s your Glory Shelter.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Lin Beifeng was shocked. “Sen, are you joking?”</p>
<p>“I came from Steel Armor Shelter, and it takes two weeks to
return there.”</p>
<p>“S#*t! I’m really in the range of another shelter.” Lin Beifeng
was very depressed.</p>
<p>He had friends in Glory Shelter, and it was easy for him to buy
flesh and beast souls. But it was likely that no one knew him at a
different shelter, so even with money it would be hard to buy
advanced flesh and beast souls.</p>
<p>“Hey, what did you do to the mammo beasts? They are being so
persistent.” Han Sen looked down again and the mammo beasts were
still there, roaring and standing on their hind legs, trying to
climb onto the stone platform.</p>
<p>“Uh, I was walking and got hungry. So I saw a young mammo beast
grazing, and…” said Lin Beifeng bitterly.</p>
<p>“It was unfortunate. It seems that we are trapped here for some
time, so before they leave, let’s be nice to each other.” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>“Right, let’s do that.” Lin Beifeng smiled agreeably and
approached Han Sen, “Sen, I’m so thirsty. Can I drink from your
water bag?”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand per cup,” Han Sen said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“S#*t! What happened to being nice?” cried Lin Beifeng.</p>
<p>“You are paying, I’m selling. Isn’t that nice?”</p>
<p>“But your water is too expensive. It is even more expensive than
water from Planet Snowspring. And ten thousand can buy a few
bottles of that. It can’t be water from Planet Snowspring that you
have,” Lin Beifeng glanced at Han Sen’s water bag and said.</p>
<p>"Although this is only water from a pool, we do not know how
long we’ll be trapped here. Water is life at this point, and we’ll
die within a week without water. And you think it’s not worth it? "
Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s worth it… but my wallet was lost on the way. Could you
give it to me on credit and I’ll pay you double when we arrive at
the shelter,” Lin Beifeng said.</p>
<p>“We don’t know each other, and you still owe me the life-saving
fee. And now you want to get water on credit. You are making this
so hard for me.” Han Sen looked indecisive.</p>
<p>“Triple… no… quadruple…”</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p>Han Sen took out his own cup and poured Lin Beifeng a cup of
water. Lin Beifeng drank the water in a gulp and gave the empty cup
back three times for more water.</p>
<p>“That’s it for today. I don’t have much water and need to save.
We still don’t know when the mammo beasts will leave.” Hansen put
the water bag away when Lin Beifeng asked the fourth time.</p>
<p>“Sen, you are so strong, so brave and so impressive that you are
able to hunt alone deep in the mountains.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Han Sen rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Lin Beifeng approached Han Sen and said, “Sen, my beast soul was
completely destroyed on the way here. Now I feel so insecure with
no beast soul on me. Do you have extra beast souls to sell?”</p>
<p>Speaking of beast souls, Han Sen had killed quite a few
primitive beasts in recent days and had gained no beast soul. He
might have used up his luck on the two sacred-blood beast souls he
got.</p>
<p>“No beast soul. Would you like some primitive meat jerky?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand per piece.”</p>
<p>“Sen, this is such a small piece!”</p>
<p>Trapped on the stone platform for eight days, they still didn’t
feel like the mammo beasts would ever leave.</p>
<p>“We cannot wait any longer. We must find a way out,” Han Sen
told Lin Beifeng solemnly.</p>
<p>“We still have some food and water. Let’s wait. And maybe the
herd is about to retreat.” Lin Beifeng had a lingering fear about
the mammo beasts.</p>
<p>“We still have water and food, as well as physical strength.
When we have used up everything, we would stand no chance,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“But how is it even possible with such a herd?” Lin Beifeng said
bitterly.</p>
<p>“So we will have to climb up.” Han Sen pointed to the cliff
above.</p>
<p>Lin Beifeng looked at the cliff standing straight into the
clouds and suddenly shuddered, “Are we capable of doing this?”</p>
<p>“We have to. It beats waiting to die, and we don’t have to climb
over. If we could climb up a bit and find somewhere to stand, we
could just walk around and go down on the other side of the cliff,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Sen, I agree,” Lin Beifeng quickly said.</p>
<p>“Great. We will start to climb now using the vines.” Han Sen
grabbed a vine, made sure it was tough enough and began
climbing.</p>
