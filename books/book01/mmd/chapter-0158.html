<p>Ji Yanran looked blankly at the silver figure in the holographic
image, unable to link it to that smiling guy.</p>
<p>“Is it really him who is driving Silver Killer?” Ji Yanran was
reluctant to accept this fact. How could that guy who joked around
all day with her have such incredible operational skills at
warframe?</p>
<p>“Judging from his performance now, his hands must be very fast.
So… when we were in that spaceship, he did not cheat? That was what
he could actually achieve?” Ji Yanran suddenly thought of it, her
body slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Then her face was flushed on the thought of another matter. She
could not help but thought, "If he really has the skills… then,
My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran would be him… "</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was more and more convinced of her guess. With that
kind of speed and ID name, who else could it be?</p>
<p>“That bastard, how dare him lie to me!” Ji Yanran felt
embarrassed. On a second thought, she suddenly found that she was
the one who took him for a cheater, while he was always trying to
explain. Han Sen had never lied to her.</p>
<p>He even told her who he was via the ID name,
My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran. this ID is not already told Ji Yannan
who is he? But Ji Yanran had never made that connect.</p>
<p>Thinking of Han Sen and that ID, Ji Yanran blushed a little
more. On the thought of the bet they made, her face was
burning.</p>
<p>“Bad, bad, bad.” Ji Yanran covered her face with both hands and
cried in a meek voice.</p>
<p>“Sweetie, are you okay?” Qu Lili was stunned by Ji, because she
had never seen this girl acting this way.</p>
<p>People next to them were also shocked by Ji Yanran’s bashful
look.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran then realized she was still at the venue of the Hand
of God games, surrounded by the members of Hand of God Society. She
was mortified and wished that she could become invisible.</p>
<p>"It’s a great victory. Let’s remember these two names, Silver
Killer and its driver Han Sen. Maybe we’re witnessing the rise of
another king in the Military Academy League. He is creating
history… "Fang Mingquan’s passionate voice marked the end of an
extraordinary single warframe combat.</p>
<p>Remaining on the field were only two warframes, Han Sen’s Silver
Killer and Lu Meng’s Victor. All the other warframes had
exploded.</p>
<p>Lu Meng quit the game and left the ring to Silver Killer, which
had just ended its frenzy. More than three or four hundred
warframes were blown off by it.</p>
<p>When the Silver Killer stepped on the podium and accepted the
trophy, thunderous applause lasted a long time. In any case, this
was a memorable game.</p>
<p>The two names, Silver Killer and Han Sen, were also imprinted on
all viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>The group warframe combat did not even begin. After the single
combat, all other players were crushed psychologically and thus
conceded in the beginning. The team of the Heavy Warframe Society
won the championship by default.</p>
<p>After the end of the game, a lot of people were still too
excited to leave, talking about the crazy game. One hour after Fang
Mingquan’s live show had ended, the number of people watching his
program even increased.</p>
<p>More and more people were hoping to see Fang Mingquan’s
recording of the game.</p>
<p>Although other news stations had also recorded this game, their
equipment there was not good enough and the quality of their
recordings was poor.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan did not waste a minute before he asked all the
staff to edit the footage as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Silver Killer was the center of attention in the edited
recording, except in the beginning when it was covered by the
Destroyer.</p>
<p>Silver Killer’s movements were so perfect that the staff did not
want to give up any frames. So, the final version was more than 30
minutes.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan named the video himself before uploading: “Best
Division Single Warframe Combat Champion—Silver Killer and Its
Gorgeous Conquer.”</p>
<p>The moment the video was uploaded, it was downloaded and spread
at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>All the people who had watched it could feel nothing but
satisfactory.</p>
<p>They were impressed by the silver warframe that moved like ghost
and its violent gunshots. Everyone enjoyed the pleasure of seeing
its incredible accuracy and swift slaying.</p>
<p>People even became addicted and watched it over and over
again.</p>
<p>“This is a true warframe!”</p>
<p>“Have watched a dozen times. I can’t stop now.”</p>
<p>“A gorgeous killing feast.”</p>
<p>“Which company made this? I want one so much.”</p>
<p>“Same here. I need this warframe in my life.”</p>
<p>“I want to buy ten of this.”</p>
<p>“Do not just look at the warframe. The driver is the key. He is
definitely beyond the unevolved level. I bet that you can count the
top players like him in the whole Military Academy League with one
hand.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, and he is in the Archery Department and Heavy Warframe
Society. The Warframe Society must feel humiliated.”</p>
<p>“Funny to think that an archery student is the champion of a
warframe game.”</p>
<p>“I heard that the Archery Department of Blackhawk was on the
bottom of Military Academy League in the previous year.”</p>
<p>“I wonder how his archery skills are.”</p>
<p>“Of course he is good at archery–he is in the Archery
Department.”</p>
<p>“He has way too nJadeskin to drive in such a brutal style.”</p>
<p>“I barely saw him miss.”</p>
<p>“He is an archery student. How is his accuracy even worth
discussing?”</p>
<p>The video went viral all over the Alliance quickly. Students
from all military schools had seen the video and made a variety of
analyses of it.</p>
<p>Most of their conclusion was that Silver Killer and its driver
had gone beyond the level of ordinary military school students.</p>
