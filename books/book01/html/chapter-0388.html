<p>Han Sen found a hidden spot and started to appreciate his newly
gained super beast soul in excitement.</p>

<!-- Type of beast soul of super creature blood snail: pet armor. --></div>
<p>“Pet armor? Is this beast soul used on pets?” Han Sen had never
heard of such a beast soul</p>
<p>Feeling puzzled, Han Sen hesitated and summoned Meowth. He then
used the super pet armor on Meowth.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the shadow of blood snail was attached to
Meowth and then turned into a translucent jade shell, covering the
entire body of Meowth, which now looked like a jade statue.</p>
<p>“Run, Meowth!” Han Sen wondered whether Meowth could still run
fast wearing such armor.</p>
<p>Meowth roared and set out like a lightning bolt. In an instant,
Meowth was almost 200 feet away, even faster than it was
before.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. It seemed that the pet armor did not
affect Meowth’s speed but enhanced its fitness.</p>
<p>Han Sen called Meowth back and beat it hard. It seemed that the
super pet armor had incredible defense, which was much better than
Han Sen’s sacred-blood armor.</p>
<p>Without using the cursed wolf dagger, Han Sen could not even
break the super pet armor.</p>
<p>“Lucky… I have been so lucky. With the super pet armor, Meowth
should be able to take attacks from some of the super creatures.
With such a super pet as my tank, I do not need to probe and take
the risks on my own when hunting another super creature.” Han Sen
became overjoyed and kissed Meowth on its forehead.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned the golden rock worm king and holy angel,
trying to equip them with the super pet armor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pet not transformed yet. Unable to use pet armor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen got a hint telling him it could not be used.</p>
<p>Only transformed pets could use the super pet armor.
Fortunately, the golden rock worm king should be transforming
soon.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he should kill one or two sacred-blood creatures
to feed the golden rock worm king.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen was not in the mood. He was thinking about
something else, which was the ability of the beetle knight. Ning
Yue had shown him the power of a doppelgänger beast soul. Having
spent many days with Ning Yue, Han Sen was not even able to tell it
was just a doppelgänger. This kind of ability was simply
unbelievable, which was also quite meaningful to Han Sen.</p>
<p>He was about to evolve, and the beast souls belonging to Dollar
were less and less useful. Although he could sell them using
Dollar’s name, the things he got in return would still be traced
back to Han Sen.</p>
<p>With the doppelgänger, Han Sen could be two persons at the same
time and purchase the beast souls Dollar sold. No one had to know
the connection between himself and Dollar, which was perfect.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not wait to know whether the beetle knight would
work in the same way as Ning Yue’s doppelgänger beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to Faith Shelter overnight and teleported back
to Blackhawk. He then went to the restroom in his dormitory.
Watching his reflection in the mirror, Han Sen summoned the beetle
knight again. Previously, the beetle knight could not be summoned.
However, this time it came out of Han Sen’s mind.</p>
<p>Without a pause, the beetle knight entered the mirror. A ripple
appeared in the mirror as the beetle knight walked inside. After
the beetle knight was in the mirror, it integrated itself with Han
Sen’s reflection and walked out of the mirror.</p>
<p>Looking at the beetle knight that looked exactly like himself,
Han Sen opened his mouth wide and could not begin to describe the
excitement he was feeling.</p>
<p>After a series of experiments, Han Sen felt more and more
thrilled. He could even manipulate the beetle knight’s body from
the beast soul’s perspective.</p>
<p>Although the beetle knight had become Han Sen, its physique was
still the same as the beast soul, vastly different from Han
Sen’s.</p>
<p>To Han Sen’s satisfaction, the doppelgänger could use beast
souls like a normal human being, as long as Han Sen transferred the
beast souls to it.</p>
<p>It is exactly what I think. This way, Dollar’s identity would no
longer be an issue. Han Sen was wondering how he could transfer
Dollar’s beast souls to himself without exposing his secret.
However, he could only do that when he returned to Steel Armor
Shelter. Otherwise, people would still connect him with Dollar.</p>
<p>The next morning, Han Sen was preparing to go back to Steel
Armor Shelter. Since he had already killed the super creature and
antagonized Ning Yue, it was no longer a good idea to stay in Faith
Shelter.</p>
<p>“Mr. Han, how about we find a place to talk?” Before Han Sen
left Faith Shelter, Ning Yue was standing in front of him, with a
gentle smile per usual, as if nothing had happened between Han Sen
and him.</p>
<p>“Is there anything to talk about between us?” Han Sen looked
around and did not see any suspicious person.</p>
<p>“I am alone, and you could decide where we have the talk,” Ning
Yue smiled and said. “Mr. Han, competition and business should not
be mixed. If you have already killed the creature, I am willing to
pay for the meat. If you’re willing to sell the beast soul, it
would be even better. I can accept any price you name.”</p>
<p>“Young master, do you really think I could kill the creature
alone?” Han Sen licked his lips and said.</p>
<p>“Previously I did not believe that. However, after that day, I
no longer dared to think so. You are not an ordinary person,” said
Ning Yue earnestly.</p>
<p>“Young master, you give me too much credit. However, I am not as
strong as you think.” Han Sen paused and said, “You know clearly
when I came back and whether I had brought any meat back. What more
do I need to say?”</p>
<p>Naturally, Ning Yue knew what Han Sen meant. The creature was
huge and had a lot of meat. Han Sen returned on the same day. If he
had obtained the meat, it was impossible for him to finish eating
it. However, Han Sen brought nothing back.</p>
<p>“But the creature disappeared,” Ning Yue stared into Han Sen’s
eyes and said.</p>
<p>“I had also gone down to the Valley and did not find the
creature. If you’re asking me where it went, I would have to let
you down again.” Han Sen was not afraid that Ning Yue would not
believe him. So far, no one knew that the body of a super creature
would disappear after being killed. No matter how smart Ning Yue
was, he would not know there was no meat to begin with.</p>
<p>Ning Yue watched Han Sen for a while but could tell nothing. He
chuckled and asked, “What’s your plan later? How about we continue
to collaborate?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. To be honest, I am scared.” Han Sen waved his
hand and walked toward the exit of the shelter, “I will go back to
Steel Armor Shelter. Forget about the collaboration. I am too old
for that kind of thrill.”</p>
