<p>Yang Zikun did not ask Han Sen to meet in God’s Sanctuary, but
managed to get Han Sen out of Blackhawk and took him to a private
club.</p>
<p>Han Sen had little faith in the so-called closed-door military
training at this point. Those with means could always open the
doors.</p>
<p>“Mister, you did not go through all this trouble just to drink
with me, right?” Sitting on the couch, Han Sen asked Yang Zikun who
was sitting opposite him.</p>
<p>“Brother, today I asked you to come both to learn boomerang
skills from you and to ask for a favor.” Yang Zikun was very polite
to Han Sen. Since Han Sen beat him at boomerang, Yang Zikun had
thought of Han Sen as a master.</p>
<p>Yang Zikun had spent a lot of time practicing butterfly
boomerang recently, but the effect was not ideal. He had asked a
lot of masters to gain a bit progress. However, if he wanted to
reach Han Sen’s level, it would take him years of hard work.</p>
<p>“Business first. You can learn boomerang from me anytime. I have
a fair rate for tutoring,” Han Sen smiled and said.</p>
<p>Yang Zikun gave him a thumbs-up and said, “Great. I love how
direct you are. I’ll be straightforward with you then. I’ve asked
you to come today because I need some sacred-blood beast souls and
wonder if I can purchase some in Steel Armor Shelter.”</p>
<p>“Sacred-blood beast souls are rare. Too many people need them,
yet too few want to sell. Even if someone was to evolve and sell
part of their sacred-blood beast souls, those beast souls would
most likely be reserved in advance. You should know that very
well,” Han Sen pondered and said.</p>
<p>When Qin Xuan evolved, she only kept two sacred-blood beast
souls with her to enter Second God’s Sanctuary. Her other beast
souls were reserved long before they went to an auction.</p>
<p>Those who had purchased her sacred-blood beast souls were
probably extremely wealthy people like Yang Zikun, Yuan and Qing.
After they got their hands on the sacred-blood beast souls, it was
highly unlikely that they would sell them again. These people
normally chose to bring all the sacred-blood beast souls with them
when they became evolvers.</p>
<p>Although the sacred-blood beast souls from First God’s Sanctuary
would not be considered strong in Second God’s Sanctuary, in the
early stage, they could still be helpful.</p>
<p>That was one of the reasons why the sacred-blood beast souls
were so rare in First God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>“If it is easy, I will not need to ask for your help, brother.”
Yang Zikun turned on the holographic video, and the image of a
person appeared.</p>
<p>The clip was pre-recorded. That person summoned his beast souls
one by one and introduced them.</p>
<p>After showing the clip, Yang Zikun showed Han Sen and another
clip that was similar to the first one.</p>
<p>“Brother, I want to trade with you for sacred-blood beast souls.
I can offer you beast souls or warframes. This private club is
specialized in beast soul dealing. You can have a look at the
clips. If you have a certain beast soul in mind, I can trade with
you. Most people here are not from Steel Armor Shelter,” said Yang
Zikun.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes lit up. He asked, “Does this private club also
deal beast souls from Second God’s Sanctuary?”</p>
<p>Yang Zikun was puzzled and explained to Han Sen, “That is
possible. But most deals are conducted in the same phase. It would
be harder to exchange across different phases.”</p>
<p>“If I were to exchange sacred-blood beast souls in the First
God’s Sanctuary for sacred-blood beast souls in the second, what
would that be like?” Han Sen asked. His family was doing well
financially, but he had hoped to gain some sacred-blood beast souls
for his mother to guarantee her safety in Second God’s
Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Second God’s Sanctuary was not like the first. It was extremely
risky and even the shelters were not 100% safe.</p>
<p>Creatures would attack shelters in large groups in Second God’s
Sanctuary, which was different from the First.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to trade, that’s okay. But it depends on what
kind of beast souls you have. Normally speaking, three sacred-blood
beast souls from First God’s Sanctuary could be used to trade for
one sacred-blood beast soul in the second. After all, it is much
more difficult to gain a sacred-blood beast soul in Second God’s
Sanctuary,” explained Yang Zikun briefly.</p>
<p>Han Sen pondered for a while and said to Yang Zikun, “I do have
some sacred-blood beast souls on hand, but I am not interested in
anything else but the sacred-blood beast souls in Second God’s
Sanctuary. And the trade must be conducted in Sapphire Shelter of
Second God’s Sanctuary.”</p>
<p>Yang Zikun looked at Han Sen and asked, “Brother, do you have
any requirement for the types of beast souls you want?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer beast soul armor, followed by beast soul mount
and beast soul wings.” Han Sen wanted to get some beast souls that
could keep his mother safe.</p>
<p>When he evolved and entered Second God’s Sanctuary, it would be
easy for him to get beast souls and meat for his mother. The most
important thing was to keep his mother alive.</p>
<p>Although Luo Sulan was located in a large human shelter and all
she did was killing ordinary creatures and primitive creatures at
most, it was hard to say what would happen in Second God’s
Sanctuary. Many human shelters be destroyed overnight.</p>
<p>“Give me a minute.” Yang Zikun checked his comlink and dialed a
number. A man of about sixty years old appeared in the holographic
image.</p>
<p>“Young master.” The man bowed to Yang Zikun.</p>
<p>“Mr. Xu, could you check for me how many sacred-blood beast
souls we could use in Sapphire Shelter of Second God’s Sanctuary?”
Asked Yang Zikun.</p>
<p>“One moment, young master. I will report to you when I have the
information.”</p>
<p>Yang Zikun turned off his comlink and said to Han Sen with a
smile, “Brother, let’s see if anything interests you. If there is
something you like, then we will continue our discussion.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and admired Yang Zikun’s masterful manner.
Indeed, Yang Zikun was the grandson of a demigod. Although he was
still young, he treated everyone gracefully.</p>
<p>Shortly, Mr. Xu knocked on the door in person and showed a video
clip to Yang Zikun, while explaining, “Currently, we have three
sacred-blood beast souls that we can use in Sapphire shelter. One
is…”</p>
<p>After he had explained everything, Mr. Xu stepped back and
waited for Yang Zikun to speak.</p>
<p>“Brother, what do you think?” Yang Zikun asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu looked at Han Sen in surprise. He knew very well Yang
Zikun’s character and thought Han Sen must be someone important so
that Yang Zikun will treat him this way.</p>
<p>“I am very interested in the sacred-blood armor and sacred-blood
mount. I have three sacred-blood beast souls that I want to use to
exchange for those two. Do you think that’s doable?” Han Sen
pondered and asked.</p>
