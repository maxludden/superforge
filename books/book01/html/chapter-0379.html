<p>“Taking my knockout drops and you haven’t fallen? A strong
fighter indeed,” Zhu Ting said to Han Sen with a smile, looking
rather surprised.</p>
<p>“Who on earth are you?” Han Sen had now understood that Zhu Ting
was probably a spy in Starry Group. Otherwise, he would not poison
the rest of the group as well. However, Han Sen still did not know
which force he belonged to.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect Zhu Ting to be a spy. Someone as petty as
him did not seem to be spy material.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting paused and said, “It does not matter who I am. The key
is you should know who owns you.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Han Sen stared at Zhu Ting and asked.</p>
<p>“Now you have two options. One is to give me the beast soul
dagger, and the other is to die. I am a fair person. You can choose
yourself.” Zhu Ting was still smiling.</p>
<p>“Do you take me for a moron? If I give you the dagger, I will
only die faster,” Han Sen sneered.</p>
<p>“It is possible that you live after giving me the dagger, but if
you do not give it to me, you will die for sure. Even if I cannot
have the dagger, I will not let Ning Yue have it,” said Zhu Ting.
He summoned a beast soul sword and cut it at Han Sen’s neck.</p>
<p>When the blade was about to touch Han Sen’s neck, Han Sen
flipped his wrist and the dagger hit the sword. With a crack, Zhu
Ting’s sword was broken.</p>
<p>“What the…?” Zhu Ting looked at Han Sen in surprise. He
obviously did not realize Han Sen had such strength after taking
the knockout drops.</p>
<p>The knockout drops he used had no scent or taste. After taking
it, one would not be knocked out immediately, but after a while.
The drug was a family secret, which had never failed Zhu Ting
before. Zhu Ting had soaked the barbecue with the drug and watched
Han Sen eating the meat. It was simply impossible that Han Sen was
not affected.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not think that much and stabbed the dagger at Zhu
Ting. For someone who wanted to kill him, Han Sen would not have
mercy.</p>
<p>The strike was fast and fierce, but Zhu Ting moved in an
incredible angle and dodged the dagger. Han Sen felt like he had
seen this footwork somewhere before.</p>
<p>“Seven Twists! You are one of the Chens?” Han Sen immediately
remembered where he had seen Zhu Ting’s footwork. Chen Zichen had
once used the same technique.</p>
<p>“You know about the Chens and Seven Twists?” Zhu Ting also
seemed surprised. He did not expect Han Sen to be able to recognize
his footwork.</p>
<p>“So, you are indeed one of the Chens?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It does not matter if that is true. You can tell me what your
connection to the Chens is. If you’re lucky, maybe I will spare
your life,” said Zhu Ting quietly.</p>
<p>“I would love to know how you can take my life,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“There are many types of strengths in the world. Using drugs is
one of them, which is my specialty. You are now poisoned with my
drug and will die any time,” said Zhu Ting.</p>
<p>“It seems that your drug did not work on me,” replied Han Sen.
“Now you should think about how you can make me spare your
life.”</p>
<p>Zhu Ting smiled and said, “You think it is impressive that you
were not knocked out? That drug only makes you sleep. The poison I
am talking about is nothing like that.”</p>
<p>Zhu Ting put his hand in front of his nose, looking enchanted.
“Did you smell the fragrance? It is no perfume, but real poison.
Have you heard about hyper geno art called Deadly Perfume? It makes
the user develop genes that produce poison. Every person would have
his unique poison. So even if you have also practiced Deadly
Perfume, you cannot produce the antidote of my poison. And as far
as I know, I am the only person who had survived after practicing
Deadly Perfume, which is now a forbidden technique.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe that you can drug me with a scent,” said Han
Sen calmly.</p>
<p>“Initially I could not, but since you have been drugged with the
knockout drops, it will bring out the Deadly Perfume in you,” Zhu
Ting smiled and said.</p>
<p>“So, I am a dead man already?” Han Sen asked. “Can you tell me
who you are?”</p>
<p>“That is not necessarily true. Since I can produce the poison, I
can also make the antidote if you give me the beast soul dagger, I
will let you live,” Zhu Ting squinted his eyes and said.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to believe you?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting spread his hands and said, “In fact, there is no need
for me to kill you. After this incident, it is no longer possible
for me to stay in Starry Group. Killing you would not do anything
for me. And without the dagger, you have no value to me.”</p>
<p>“What if I do not want to give it to you?” said Han Sen
calmly.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting looked Han Sen up and down and suddenly chuckled. “In
fact, we can also collaborate. What did Ning Yue offer you? I can
offer you the same and save you from my poison. What do you think
of these terms?”</p>
<p>“I still need to ask, how am I supposed to believe you?” Han Sen
said quietly. He was only trying to know as much information as he
could. The poison did not have much effect on him due to
Jadeskin.</p>
<p>“You should know that when I used the sword on you, I was not
trying to kill you. It was just a bluff,” said Zhu Ting.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. Obviously, he knew that Zhu Ting
did not use real force. However, the sword was a sacred-blood
sword, so Han Sen still cut it in half.</p>
<p>“Okay. I will tell you something you do not know about. In fact,
I bet you have no idea what kind of creature Ning Yue was asking
you to kill,” Zhu Ting sighed and said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just a sacred-blood creature?” Han Sen’s heart leapt,
but his face remained still.</p>
<p>“Sacred-blood creature? Maybe. At least no one knows if they are
sacred-blood creatures so far,” Zhu Ting grinned and said.</p>
<p>“Would you mean?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Have you thought about why some sacred-blood creatures were
significantly stronger than others, like the one in the primeval
forest. Even so many people with their sacred geno points maxed out
could do nothing about it. We were not even on the same level with
it. Don’t you feel that is strange?”</p>
<p>Zhu Ting paused and said slowly, “Have you ever wondered that
maybe there are beings beyond sacred-blood creatures?”</p>
