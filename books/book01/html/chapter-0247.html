        <h2>Rather Easy</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 247</h3>

        <p>“If you could beat me, I would be very happy.” Situ Xiang
            suddenly smiled and narrowed her eyes. “However, Han Sen, it is not
            easy to achieve that. I look forward to seeing your
            performance.”</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang carried her bow and arrows to her spot and Han Sen
            went to the other spot.</p>
        <p>Ten moving targets meant that ten targets would randomly came
            from different locations. Whoever hit the effective area of the
            target first would gain a point.</p>
        <p>Different from a regular target in archery, these targets had no
            rings on them, but only the differentiation between effective area
            and noneffective area. An arrow on the noneffective area meant zero
            point, and an arrow on the effective area meant one point.</p>
        <p>Han Sen tried his bow. They were both using 7.0 bows, so the
            bows could take a certain level of strength. Although Situ Xiang
            was an evolver, she could not put more strength into it.</p>
        <p>Hence Situ Xiang’s advantage was only her speed of reaction.</p>
        <p>“Can we start?” Situ Xiang also tried her bow out. Although she
            was an evolver, she did not dare to slack in front of someone like
            Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang started the system, and a countdown began. They both
            drew their bowstrings.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a target in the shape of a human emerged from behind a
            wall. Two arrows left the strings at the same time.</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>The two arrows hit the neck area of the target, which was the
            effective area, almost at the same time.</p>
        <p>Ding!</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang’s scorekeeper rang. She gained a point because she
            hit the target first.</p>
        <p>“A coach is a coach,” said Situ Xiang with content.</p>
        <p>“Well done. You almost needed no time to react.” Han Sen had
            spared no efforts, but Situ Xiang was absolutely faster than him,
            which was something he could not make up for.</p>
        <p>Even among evolvers, Situ Xiang was doing very well.</p>
        <p>“You did pretty well already. Top of the unevolved for sure.”
            Situ Xiang meant what she said. It was only slightly slower than
            her. She had never seen this kind of speed among Blackhawk
            students.</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang was even more satisfied with Han Sen after this
            round. He was also able to hit the target right in the neck, which
            showed that he was dexterous.</p>
        <p>“I believe that there’s no point for us to continue,” decided
            Situ Xiang.</p>
        <p>She had already tested his ability and thought it would be
            needless for them to continue. Competing as an evolver with him,
            she was not being fair in the first place.</p>
        <p>“Nine rounds left. I believe I still haven’t lost,” Han Sen said
            with a smile.</p>
        <p>If they were both in the battlefield and Situ Xiang were using a
            bow that could match her strength, Han Sen would not stand any
            chance. However, in a game like this, things were different.</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang was only using a 7.0 practice bow, and all Han Sen
            was lacking was his reflex.</p>
        <p>Normally speaking, Han Sen would definitely lose because of this
            difference. In Han Sen’s eyes, however, he believed he could still
            manage to win.</p>
        <p>“Sure, let’s continue then.” Situ Xiang was considering losing
            to Han Sen on purpose in the next round, otherwise Han Sen might
            end up with too bad a score to maintain his confidence.</p>
        <p>As the two were talking, the game was still on. Suddenly a
            fox-shaped target jumped up from the floor.</p>
        <p>All the targets appeared randomly in this game. Because Situ
            Xiang needed less time to react, she could always hit the target
            first.</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang shot her arrow with confidence and saw Han Sen
            shooting slightly slower than her.</p>
        <p>Although she was pleased with Han Sen’s performance, Situ Xiang
            believed that she had won.</p>
        <p>Just when her arrow was about to hit the target, Han Sen’s arrow
            knocked hers away from the target and ended up hitting the
            target.</p>
        <p>Ding!</p>
        <p>As Situ Xiang was dazed, Han Sen gained one point.</p>
        <p>“1:1 now coach. It seems that I’m rather lucky.” Han Sen smiled
            at Situ Xiang.</p>
        <p>“Is it luck?” Situ Xiang frowned. This kind of situation would
            happen when two archers were shooting at the Same target. However,
            the probability of such circumstance was really low.</p>
        <p>“Maybe it is luck.” Situ Xiang did not pay too much attention to
            this incident and prepared for the third round.</p>
        <p>After all, even she could not guarantee hitting the effective
            area of the target after knocking another arrow away.</p>
        <p>Soon, Situ Xiang was shocked. She could not believe her eyes.
            Three rounds in a row, Han Sen’s arrow knocked hers away and hit
            the effective area of all the targets.</p>
        <p>Situ Xiang thought it was incredible and widened her eyes, “Did
            you do it on purpose?”</p>
        <p>She was not questioning him, but confirming.</p>
        <p>If Han Sen could really accomplish this, his archery skills were
            simply beyond her imagination.</p>
        <p>“Other than this, I could not think of any other method to win,”
            Han Sen shrugged and said. He had already wasted too much time and
            would like to see his dear girlfriend as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Hearing him admit doing it on purpose, Situ Xiang asked the
            student with complex emotions, “How did you do that?”</p>
        <p>“It is rather easy. To knock your arrow away, the hardest part
            is to determine the trajectory of the arrows. Since we are aiming
            at the same target, it is easy to make the judgment…” explained Han
            Sen casually.</p>
        <p>“May be Blackhawk will have a monster as well, someone like Jing
            Jiwu,” thought Situ Xiang to herself, gazing at Han Sen.</p>
