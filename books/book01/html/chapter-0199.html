<p>“Sister, what brought you here?” Han Sen took Huangfu to a green
area outside the warehouse. No one was nearby since it was
approaching midnight.</p>
<p>“Can’t I come to you for no reason?” Huangfu looked at Han Sen
ambiguously.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, but now it’s too late. If you have nothing to
say, I should go back to rest. Can we talk next time?” Han Sen
licked his lips and said.</p>
<p>“What? You are afraid that Ji Yanran might know?” Huangfu had
learned a lot about Han Sen since she came to Blackhawk, including
his girlfriend.</p>
<p>“Ahem, sister, shall we focus on the business?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“Well, last time you left before we could finish.” Huangfu threw
him a glance, her charming demeanor making his heart leap.</p>
<p>“Please continue,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“If you want the sacred-blood three-blade harpoon, there is
another way. You have an extra sacred-blood armor beast soul, don’t
you? The one you let Mengmeng wear? Shall we trade?” Huangfu said
seriously.</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen turned her offer down. A sacred-blood armor beast
soul was very rare and it could save his life, so he would not
trade it for the harpoon.</p>
<p>“But you have the other sacred-blood armor beast soul, and you
don’t need both. Isn’t it perfect that you trade one for a weapon?
I could pay you money for the difference and let me know how much
you want,”Huangfu advised.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sister. I don’t want to trade.” Han Sen did not
hesitate in the slightest way. Huangfu had mistaken the fairy queen
for a sacred-blood armor beast soul, and in fact the fairy queen’s
armor was a bit inferior to a real sacred-blood armor beast
soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen would never trade his phantom ant armor, which was
something he could always use in First God’s Sanctuary and might
still be of some use in Second God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had promised Lin Beifeng that he would consider
to sell it to Lin first if he wanted to sell.</p>
<p>The phantom ant armor was not just practical, but also
incredibly glamourous. Although it had the same function as the
black beetle armor, its price would clearly be much higher.</p>
<p>“Think about it. And money is not an issue.” Huangfu still would
not give up. She loved the look of that armor. It was not only
perfect in terms of the look, but would also protect her on her way
to other shelters, which was far more important than a weapon.</p>
<p>“I don’t need money,” Han Sen said with a smile. He blinked at
her, “But if you want me, that’s okay. Shall we get a room?”</p>
<p>“How can you get a room on campus?” Huangfu blushed and gave up.
She checked her comlink and said to Han Sen, “Think about it and
let me know if you want to sell. I must go now…”</p>
<p>Watching her leave, Han Sen grinned.</p>
<p>The black and white boxing competition was held on the Skynet.
Most people watched directly online and the players were also using
the devices at their schools to compete. There was little to see
onsite.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu arrived at the holographic equipment hall early, and
there was basically no one there other than the students from the
Martial Arts Department and Martial Arts Society.</p>
<p>She set up the camera and was ready to introduce the players
when they came in. After that she could switch to the online data
and would not need to shoot any more.</p>
<p>She was also the only reporter at Blackhawk, since it was not a
popular team and all other media went to the schools that had some
chance at winning.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu entered the lounge of the players—part of her
reporter’s privileges.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Wen Xiuxiu saw Han Sen sitting among the Martial Arts
Society members, chatting.</p>
<p>“This guy turns out to be one of the Martial Arts Society
members.” Wen Xiuxiu was a bit upset, but since his girlfriend is
that pretty, it was also understandable that he did not lead the
way.</p>
<p>Ignoring Han Sen, Wen Xiuxiu interviewed several players in the
first team and a coach of Martial Arts Society, Chen Ling.</p>
<p>“Coach Chen, what do you think of this match? Black and white
boxing is a one of St. Germain’s strengths, not to mention Nalan
Chengnuo’s fame. What plan or strategy do you have?” Wen Xiuxiu
asked Chen Ling.</p>
<p>“No plan or strategy needed. Blackhawk will win, period,” Chen
Ling said casually.</p>
<p>Chen Ling’s answer made Wen Xiuxiu pause. She could not begin to
understand Chen’s confidence.</p>
<p>Because Chen Ling’s answer was beyond her imagination, her
prepared materials were now useless. And she did not know how to
continue.</p>
<p>The answer Wen expected was that St. Germain is a very strong
team and Blackhawk will try its best.</p>
<p>But Chen Ling threw her off her feet. Wen opened her mouth but
could not think of anything to say.</p>
<p>“I have something to deal with. Ms. Wen, would you go interview
my players first.” Chen Ling saw Wen Xiuxiu’s look and was
amused.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu was embarrassed and turned to the players. She
finally saw Ouyang Xiaosan, who was resting. She hesitated, and
first approached Xu Qian who she had talked to.</p>
<p>“Hi, Xu Qian! Do you have any confidence in this game?”</p>
<p>Xu Qian was very easy to talk to and glad to be interviewed. He
grinned and said, “Of course! We will win for sure.”</p>
<p>Hearing him, Wen felt that the entire team were simply too
optimistic blind to their weakness.</p>
<p>Wen asked a few more questions, and interviewed several other
players. The answers she got were all the same—Blackhawk would
defeat St. Germain and go to the next round.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ouyang, I would like to your opinion on Nalan Chengnuo.”
Wen Xiuxiu finally found a chance to interview Ouyang Xiaosan.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him.” Ouyang did not even lift his eyes.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu had no idea that her interviews had caused a debate
in the Skynet.</p>
