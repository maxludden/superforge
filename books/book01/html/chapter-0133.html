<p>“Sen, are you going for it?” Shi looked at Han Sen with hidden
excitement. He felt even Han Sen’s opponent was Li Yufeng, Han
would still win. Although Shi had never seen Li Yufeng play, he
believed so. Han Sen’s performance so far made him think that Han
must be almost invincible in this game.</p>
<p>Lu Meng and Zhang Yang were also looking at Han Sen, awaiting
his decision.</p>
<p>“Of course I will,” Han Sen said casually.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was the girlfriend he won with a bet. Although he was
too busy to look for her, he would not allow other guys to use
himself to impress her.</p>
<p>In the Han Sen’s view, it was fine if Li tried to show off in
front of Ji Yanran, but there was no way Han Sen would allow
himself to be used in the process.</p>
<p>Hearing Han Sen’s answer, Shi and Lu were both thrilled. Zhang
Yang rubbed his hands together and said, “Now that’s it. Young
people should be motivated, and we all support you to defeat Li
Yufeng and make Ji Yanran your girlfriend for real.”</p>
<p>“Right! If you really have such a gorgeous girlfriend, the
entire Room 304 would all feel honored,” said Shi excitedly.</p>
<p>“Go on the forum and reply him with a time for the duel. Sen has
a big chance to beat Li, in my opinion.” Lu Meng laughed.</p>
<p>“Chance? Li Yufeng is no match to Sen at all,” Shi curled his
lips downward and said.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to the campus community forum and found the post at
the top. After he clicked on it, he replied with a time using his
account My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran.</p>
<p>“10:30 pm.” Han Sen left just the time and did not even bother
to read Li Yufeng’s post.</p>
<p>Han Sen never took any of his schoolmates as a serious match of
his.</p>
<p>In a short amount of time, his reply attracted the attention of
all the students.</p>
<p>Because Li Yufeng’s post had been up for several days, people
thought Ji Yanran’s boyfriend was too scared to reply. But today,
seeing his reply and the ID name, a student was in shock. Having
rubbed his eyes and confirmed several times, he started to spread
the news, “Ha-ha, Ji Yanran’s boyfriend replied directly with the
time of the duel. We have something to watch.”</p>
<p>“Really? He did that?”</p>
<p>“So daring. It is Li Yufeng!”</p>
<p>“What about Li Yufeng? I think Ji Yanran’s boyfriend is
definitely stronger.”</p>
<p>“That is hard to say. After all, Li Yufeng is a professional
player and the best on campus. He also had good performance in the
contest across the Alliance.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that Ji Yanran’s boyfriend is not
professional?”</p>
<p>“That makes sense. No one knows who Ji Yanran’s boyfriend is, so
he could be a professional player as well.”</p>
<p>“Would it be Ouyang Xiaosan?”</p>
<p>“I think not. According to Ouyang Xiaosan’s character, he would
not have replied at all.”</p>
<p>“If it’s not Ouyang Xiaosan, then who can it be? I really cannot
think of anyone in the school who is so strong.”</p>
<p>“Could it be a freshman?”</p>
<p>“How can that be? Freshmen are all rookies. If there is such an
outstanding person, we should have known when they had the entrance
exam.”</p>
<p>Soon the duel between Li Yufeng and Ji Yanran’s boyfriend was
known by the entire school.</p>
<p>“Yanran, your boyfriend appeared.” Qu Lili ran to the training
hall, panting.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran paused and bristled, “I said a million times that he
is not my boyfriend, so do not call him that.”</p>
<p>Qu Lili took Ji Yanran’s hand, grinned and said, “I know. I
won’t do that again, but your… My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran said
online that he would have a duel against Li Yufeng tonight at
10:30.”</p>
<p>“Yanran, I envy you that there are two great guys fighting for
you, making you quite the princess,” Qu Lili said admiringly.</p>
<p>“You can have them both if you want,” Ji Yanran said
sullenly.</p>
<p>She did not really like Li Yufeng, but Li had been chasing after
her for two years. She was quite upset by his pursuit.</p>
<p>As for My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran, he was using such a devious
means that Ji Yanran had even less interest in him.</p>
<p>But Ji Yanran was still a little curious and wanted to find out
who that person was. In addition to lashing out at him, she also
wanted to know who had such a good level as Li Yufeng and Ouyang
Xiaosan.</p>
<p>If he is not beyond salvation, she could consider recruiting him
into her society so that their ranking this year could be further
enhanced.</p>
<p>“I want to, but they did not do it for me,” Qu Lili complained.
“If there are two men at a duel for me, I will give them a
chance.”</p>
<p>“You little fool. You said 10:30 tonight, right?” Ji Yanran
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, your boyfriend said that,” said Qu Lili.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was speechless, but she was not about to correct Qu
Lili. In fact, the entire school called him that and she was just
powerless.</p>
<p>“This time I will find out who you are.” Ji Yanran stopped
training and went back to get ready to see their duel.</p>
<p>As soon as she watched that person play, she should be able to
tell who he was from his style. Unless he was not one of the
players on campus, she would have an idea.</p>
<p>After Li Yufeng saw the reply, his eyes lit up and continued his
Hand of God training.</p>
<p>“Boss, Ji Yanran’s boyfriend replied,” A thin man rushed in and
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Li Yufeng suddenly frowned at him, so the thin man quickly
corrected himself, “No, the despicable guy replied 10:30
tonight.”</p>
<p>“I have seen it.” Li Yufeng said casually.</p>
<p>“Boss, you must kick his ass this time, and prove our society’s
worth,” said the thin man.</p>
<p>“I will not go easy on him,” said Li Yufeng coldly.</p>
