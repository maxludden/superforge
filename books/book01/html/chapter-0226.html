        <p>After the semi-annual assessment, Han Sen was celebrating with
            his roommates, Ji Yanran and Qu Lili in the cafeteria.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, we are all human. How come there is such a difference?
            I did not spend time in the relationship or playing. All I did was
            training in the archery Department and all I had was an a. You’re
            never in our department and was driving warframe’s and playing with
            your girlfriend all the time. How come you got an s? It’s not
            fair,” exclaimed Shi Zhikang.</p>
        <p>“Come on. You’re in the heavy Warframe Society all the time as
            well,” said Lu Meng.</p>
        <p>“Lu, whose side are you on?” Shi Zhikang stared at Lu Meng.</p>
        <p>“Not yours.” Lu Meng laughed.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>After dinner, the group of friends went to sing karaoke and play
            games until late. Han Sen hinted Shi Zhikang to lead Qu Lili away
            so that he could accompany his girlfriend back alone.</p>
        <p>“Why are you following me?” At the gate of her dormitory
            building, Han Sen was ready to follow her upstairs.</p>
        <p>“I’ll go warm your bed.” Han Sen grinned.</p>
        <p>“I don’t need that.” She blushed and said fiercely.</p>
        <p>“Beauty, have you forgotten that you just gave me half a million
            the few days ago? As a professional, I will serve you with all I
            have, so warming your bed is a must.” Han Sen blinked and said.</p>
        <p>“Go away. If anyone else saw us, I won’t forgive you.” Ji Yanran
            blushed and bit her lip.</p>
        <p>“So, if no one could see me, I could follow you upstairs?” asked
            Han Sen casually.</p>
        <p>“How’s that possible? Go back.” Ji Yanran curled her lips.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not leave. He walked over to a corner where the
            camera could not cover and summoned the beast soul of the
            sacred-blood color shifter. Suddenly, he became part of the
            surroundings.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran widened her eyes and saw her boyfriend disappear in
            front of her. She was so shocked that she couldn’t see anything
            standing next to him.</p>
        <p>She had to touch him to make sure that he will still there.</p>
        <p>“What kind of beast soul is this?” Ji Yanran was surprised.</p>
        <p>“Color shifter. Can I go up now?” asked Han Sen with a
            smile.</p>
        <p>“Stay farther. If someone noticed you, you’ll be dead.” She
            blushed and went upstairs.</p>
        <p>Han Sen followed her slowly. Fortunately, it was dark already
            and there was no one nearby. Although when Han Sen moved there were
            certain cracks, no one was there to discover them, so he came
            directly to her room.</p>
        <p>With Qu Lili being pulled away by his roommates, she would not
            be back in a while. Ji Yanran opened the door just a crack to see
            that there was no one out there before she let her boyfriend
            in.</p>
        <p>“Do you want something to eat? You were just drinking and did
            not eat much.” Ji Yanran said, looking through the food she
            had.</p>
        <p>“You’re enough. I don’t want anything else,” sitting on the
            couch, Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
        <p>“Can you be serious for a minute?” Ji Yanran took some cake and
            some water to him.</p>
        <p>“I am being serious and professional, trying to make your half a
            million well spent,” Han Sen said.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran saw his look and laughed. Then she rolled her eyes and
            said, “Well, if you don’t eat, I will.”</p>
        <p>She then put a slice of cake in a plate and started to eat.</p>
        <p>Sitting next to her, Han Sen regarded his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>“What are you looking at?” Ji Yanran blushed under his gaze.</p>
        <p>“Look at you. You have cake on your cheek.” Han Sen reached
            over.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran thought he was going to wipe away the cake on her face
            and did not move, but his hand held her chin and he licked the cake
            away instead.</p>
        <p>Then he licked the cream on her lips, and said, “Delicious.”</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran’s eyes lit up and suddenly hit his face with the
            entire piece of cake in her hand.</p>
        <p>While Han Sen was shocked, she held his shoulder and said, “You
            have cake on your cheek as well.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen was dazed. She used her little tongue to lick away a
            piece of cream on his face, blushing.</p>
        <p>Han Sen could no longer hold it back. He reached out to hold her
            waist and rubbed her face with his, tasting the cream and her soft
            skin at the same time.</p>
        <p>His hands also found their way to her plump butt.</p>
        <p>While the two were enjoying the sweetness, they suddenly heard
            the door being opened.</p>
        <p>“I knew there was something wrong. Genius, you are a genius in
            stealing a girl’s heart as well.” Qu Lili walked in with a
            smile.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran jumped away from Han Sen’s arms, stared at Qu Lili and
            could not say a thing.</p>
        <p>“Shi Zhikang, I shouldn’t have counted on you. How did you let
            her back so soon?” thought Han Sen. He had no way around it and had
            to excuse himself.</p>
        <p>There was no way that he could continue his endeavor this
            evening anyway.</p>
        <p>Watching him going away, Qu Lili had a complex look on her
            face.</p>
        <p>Han Sen didn’t go far before his comlink rang. Han Sen thought
            it was Ji Yanran and answered, but instead he saw Huangfu Pingqing
            in white lingerie in the holographic image.</p>
        <p>“Brother Han, do you still remember our agreement? Do you have
            time Tomorrow?” asked Huangfu Pingqing with a smile.</p>
        <p>“Yes. Where do you want to go?” Han Sen touched his nose and
            said.</p>
        <p>When he made the contract with Huangfu Pingqing, he also
            promised her to go hunting with her once and he had to honor his
            words.</p>
