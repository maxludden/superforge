        <p>On her way back, Yang Manli rode her mount following Han Sen,
            watching her boss with mixed feelings.</p>
        <p>Yang Manli suddenly felt that Han Sen had become someone she did
            not know. The guy who she used to despise had grown so strong.</p>
        <p>When she lost in the archery competition against him, she was a
            little bit unconvinced. However, now she felt ashamed for how she
            looked at Han Sen, who had grown to be someone she needed to look
            up to.</p>
        <p>“Qin Xuan does have better judgment than I do,” thought Yang
            Manli.</p>
        <p>Yuan and Qing marched together with Han Sen. Although Yuan did
            not get the beast soul after killing the sacred-blood creature, he
            was still praising Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, in the future we can live with ease. With you in Steel
            Armor Shelter, we don’t need to worry about hunting anymore,” Qing
            said excitedly.</p>
        <p>“I am not able to kill every sacred-blood creature,” Han Sen
            smiled and said.</p>
        <p>This time, it was such an easy kill for him because the
            environment was perfect for an assassin like himself. Also, Qin
            Xuan had already left him with detailed information, which helped
            him a lot.</p>
        <p>After returning to his office at Steel Armor Shelter, Han Sen
            said to Yang Manli, “Deputy, your performance today was not
            professional. With your ability, you should’ve done better.”</p>
        <p>Blushing, Yang Manli moved her lips but failed to mutter a
            word.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as Han Sen said, she could have done much better even
            though she could not beat the creature. The reason why she acted
            poorly was that she was distracted by her grudge.</p>
        <p>Yang Manli had no argument to make.</p>
        <p>“As a soldier, you should trust your comrade. Obviously, you did
            not trust me.”</p>
        <p>“I am sorry, captain. It will not happen again,” Yang Manli said
            with her head down.</p>
        <p>It was rare that Yang Manli would apologize. However, she
            realized that she had made a terrible mistake, and Han Sen’s
            performance had won him her respect.</p>
        <p>“Great,” Han Sen said with satisfaction. “This stops here, and I
            do not want to see it happen again.”</p>
        <p>“Never,” said Yang Manli.</p>
        <p>After Yang Manli left, Han Sen went back to the Alliance and
            logged in the special squad platform.</p>
        <p>Yuan had marked completion of the mission. Because Han Sen had
            accomplished it on his own, the gift card of the S-level geno
            solution and 10 points were added to his name.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was overjoyed, but he did not have something in mind to
            buy, so he kept the gift card and points.</p>
        <p>Actually, if he could find the tutorials for hyper geno arts, he
            only needed to buy the corresponding geno solutions and would not
            need a license.</p>
        <p>However, Han Sen did not have a tutorial at the point and could
            not make use of the gift card.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Han Sen had time to enjoy a nice meal with his
            girlfriend Ji Yanran, without knowing that there was a storm
            approaching.</p>
        <p>Because the Military Academy League had forbidden one player
            competing in multiple subjects, Jing Jiwu chose to participate in
            the archery tournament this year, driving many to pay special
            attention to the archery tournament.</p>
        <p>When the list of players and game schedule were published by the
            league, a lot of people discovered that the opponent of the
            Alliance Central Military Academy was Blackhawk in the second
            round.</p>
        <p>If it were the Blackhawk that people had known, no one would pay
            extra attention to them. However, people noticed that Han Sen was
            one of the Blackhawk players. Many people were suddenly reminded
            that Han Sen was an archery student after all.</p>
        <p>“That’ll be something to watch. Jing Jiwu versus Han Sen!”</p>
        <p>“I only know that Han Sen is great at warframe and black and
            white boxing. Who has any idea about his archery skills?”</p>
        <p>“Being an archery student himself, he would definitely be very
            good.”</p>
        <p>“As good as he is, he could not compare to Jing Jiwu the
            monster.”</p>
        <p>“Aha, I never watch archery contests, but I’m watching this time
            for Jing Jiwu.”</p>
        <p>“Jing Jiwu, you are always my number one.”</p>
        <p>“The best military school student ever, I mean Jing Jiwu.”</p>
        <p>“I admit that Han Sen is very strong, but against Jing Jiwu he
            stands no chance.”</p>
        <p>“Han Sen is weaker than Jing Jiwu, and his teammates were way
            weaker than Jing Jiwu’s teammates. In the team competition, there
            is no suspense who the winner will be. I hope Han Sen could do well
            in individual contests.”</p>
        <p>“I like them both. Whoever loses will make me sad.”</p>
        <p>“It is such a shame that Jing Jiwu can only be in the archery
            tournament. I really want to see his warframe performance.”</p>
        <p>“I prefer to watch his martial arts competition.”</p>
        <p>“Jing Jiwu, forever King.”</p>
        <p>“No matter what, this should be a very good match to watch. I
            hope that Han Sen could do well so that we can watch for a longer
            time.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>On the Skynet, no one thought the Alliance Central Military
            Academy would lose. After all, Jing Jiwu had ruled the league for
            three years without losing in anything.</p>
        <p>Although Han Sen was also doing well in warframe and black and
            white boxing, he did not seem to be quite Jing Jiwu’s match.</p>
        <p>Even Fang Mingquan, who had always had faith in Han Sen, was
            conservative when predicting the results, only wishing Blackhawk
            and Han Sen the best.</p>
        <p>After watching Jing Jiwu’s previous games, he had to admit that
            Jing Jiwu was indeed a monster.</p>
        <p>In the entire Military Academy league, or the entire unevolved
            population, it would be hard to find Jing Jiwu’s match.</p>
        <p>Fang Mingquan could not see any flaw in Jing Jiwu. Han Sen would
            always surprise him, but Jing Jiwu made him feel absolute
            pressure.</p>
        <p>No matter what kind of opponents Jing Jiwu ran into, the monster
            would always win.</p>
        <p>“A perfect monster,” was all that Fang could say about Jing
            Jiwu.</p>
        <p>If Nalan Chengnuo could be described as wise, then Jing Jiwu
            should be called a ruler.</p>
