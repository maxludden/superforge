        <p>In the unevolved test hall of the physical test center, Zhao
            Boshan looked at “A-level” displayed on the virtual screen and was
            secretly feeling proud of himself.</p>
        <p>In order to get A-level in the test, an unevolved person must
            reach more than 10.0 in at least 100 items, including strength,
            speed, quickness, leaping ability, muscle toughness, bone strength
            and organ function.</p>
        <p>With A-level fitness, one was also very likely to be admitted
            into a military school, as long as one didn’t make a huge mistake
            during the entrance exam.</p>
        <p>In his fantasy, Zhao Boshan had already graduated from a
            military school with stellar scores and become a captain of an
            interstellar warship, directing battles in the space and receiving
            respect and worship after all his victories.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t do that well in the live combat test. If I had done
            better, I might be assessed at AA-level. Maybe I’ll try again.”
            Zhao Boshan went back, but found the test hall he had used was
            occupied.</p>
        <p>Zhao Boshan thought the testing process was quite short, so he
            decided he might as well wait there. But after he had waited for
            quite a while, the person inside still hadn’t come out.</p>
        <p>“So slow! This person inside must be stupid? If I had gone to a
            different hall, I would’ve finished by now.” Zhao Boshan was quite
            upset but not willing to give up.</p>
        <p>Zhao Boshan gave it some thought and paid to observe the test.
            Suddenly, the holographic image was projected in front of him.</p>
        <p>“I wonder how dumb this person could be to take so long.” Zhao
            Boshan looked to the golden figure in the holographic image. That
            person in the image was about to take the final test, the robot
            channel.</p>
        <p>The robot channel was the last part of the entire test. In the
            300-foot-long one-way channel, one had to beat a combat robot with
            biochemical alloy shell every six feet, and the performance of
            combat robots was stronger and stronger toward the end.</p>
        <p>As an unevolved, being able to cross the 180-foot line was
            “pass,” 210-foot line was “good,” 240-foot line was “excellent,”
            270-foot line was “advanced,” and going all the way was
            “super.”</p>
        <p>Zhao Boshan had earned a “good” score himself, but he might be
            able to pass the 240-foot line if he put in more effort.</p>
        <p>“This is weird. How come it took him so long?” Zhao Boshan felt
            strange, as all the tests before this one should have taken the
            same amount of time. What he didn’t know was that Han Sen actually
            took each test twice, the first time without beast souls and the
            second time with beast souls, so as to know his abilities under
            different circumstances.</p>
        <p>That’s why it took Han Sen so long. In fact, Han Sen had already
            been through the robot channel twice. This time, he summoned black
            beetle armor and bloody slayer at the same time and wanted to try
            the robot channel one last time under his best conditions.</p>
        <p>When Zhao Boshan saw clearly the golden figure, he was amazed by
            how great the bloody slayer and black beetle beast souls
            looked.</p>
        <p>“Shit! This guy wants to use beast souls to take the robot
            channel test. Well, even so he could hardly go all the way,
            unless…” While Zhao Boshan was still thinking, the majestic golden
            figure had rushed toward the robot channel.</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>What happened next rendered Zhao Boshan speechless. The golden
            figure ignored all combat robots trying to block him and forcefully
            went through with his strong body. The combat robot, which was much
            heavier than the man, was knocked away immediately.</p>
        <p>The golden figure was like an armored vehicle, brutally hitting
            his way through the combat robots. Even the robots’ biochemical
            alloy shells were smashed. Nothing could stop that figure.</p>
        <p>30 feet… 60 feet… 90 feet… 180 feet… 210 feet… 240 feet…</p>
        <p>Zhao Baoshan knew that the performance of the combat robots
            placed behind the 240-foot line was beyond the ability of average
            unevolved persons. But they were smashed by the golden figure as if
            they were a pile of clunkers.</p>
        <p>The robot channel that was viewed as a cruel test by most
            unevolved became an easy path for the golden figure.</p>
        <p>Unmatched strength.</p>
        <p>All combat robots in the channel, including the last one, were
            knocked away within seconds. Zhao Boshan opened his mouth and
            didn’t recover from shock for a long time. When he looked at the
            virtual screen, it already changed to “SSS-level.”</p>
        <p>“OMG, who is this fierce fellow?” Zhao Boshan saw the door of
            the test hall open and the person in the hall was gone.</p>
        <p>Zhao Boshan immediately chased him out, but the center was so
            crowded and he had no idea who that person was.</p>
        <p>“The video!” Zhao Boshan ran back to the hall, paid to play the
            recorded video and made a copy. Having watched the video a few
            times, he regretted that he didn’t see the golden figure’s
            performance before the last test.</p>
        <p>Zhao Boshan suddenly had an idea. He logged into his account and
            uploaded this copy to the official forum, and named it “7’88’’–
            Robot Channel Conquered.”</p>
