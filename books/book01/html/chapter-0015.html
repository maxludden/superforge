        <p>Han Sen kept practicing Jadeskin and recovering after he
            returned home. Every two days he went to God’s Sanctuary to check
            on the copper-toothed beast.</p>
        <p>It took the beast half a month from the time it swallowed the
            black crystal to become a mutant creature, but it was still the
            size of an ordinary copper-toothed beast, while the mutant
            copper-toothed beasts Han Sen had seen were twice that size. In
            addition to the size, the one he evolved into wasn’t much stronger
            either, not even close to a true mutant one.</p>
        <p>Han Sen took out his alloy dagger and slashed the beast on the
            neck, but caused no damage at all. It was his dagger that
            chipped.</p>
        <p>“So it is somewhat different from an ordinary one.” Han Sen
            shapeshifted into a bloody slayer and snapped its neck by
            force.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Mutant Copper-Toothed Beast Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. Eat
                Its Flesh To Gain Zero To Ten Mutant Geno Points.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The sound in his mind overjoyed Han Sen. It might look different
            than a wild mutant copper-toothed beast, but it was fine as long as
            it was indeed a mutant creature.</p>
        <p>Now what was troubling him was how to sell this mutant
            copper-toothed beast. He really needed the money, or else he could
            just eat it to gain mutant geno points.</p>
        <p>“It is too dangerous for me to sell it showing up as Dollar, now
            that the entire shelter is looking for him. But it would also be
            troublesome if I were to sell it using my own true identity.” Han
            Sen still decided to use Dollar’s name after some hesitation.</p>
        <p>Su Xiaoqiao was depressed these days. Qin Xuan asked him to find
            Dollar, but he didn’t know Dollar any more than she did, so what
            was he supposed to do?</p>
        <p>Early in the morning, Su Xiaoqiao was tripped by something and
            fell flat on his face.</p>
        <p>“Who is the motherfucker that placed a stone in front of my
            room? He’s dead if I find out.” Even more depressed than before,
            Xiaoqiao saw that there was something under the stone.</p>
        <p>He took a closer look and found a note and a bundle. The note
            said, “Goods worth fifty thousand delivered. We are square. If you
            want more, come to Zephyr Valley tomorrow. Cash only.”</p>
        <p>Although there was no signature, a coin was drawn at the lower
            left corner, making clear who it was from.</p>
        <p>“Dollar!” Su Xiaoqiao was thrilled but didn’t make a sound this
            time. Looking around and seeing no one, he took the bundle and note
            and closed the door.</p>
        <p>Su Xiaoqiao carefully opened the bundle and saw a long strip of
            meat jerky the size of two or three bites.</p>
        <p>Su Xiaoqiao chewed up the meat jerky and swallowed.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Mutant Copper-Toothed Beast Flesh Eaten. One Mutant Geno Point
                Gained.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The voice in his mind surprised Xiaoqiao, “Mutant copper-toothed
            beast flesh! So it was hunted by Dollar? He must have more now that
            he asked me to bring cash to Zephyr Valley.”</p>
        <p>Thinking of this, he got even more excited that he could bring
            Qin Xuan’s message to Dollar and buy mutant flesh from him at the
            same time.</p>
        <p>Early in the morning, Su Xiaoqiao set off to Zephyr Valley. He
            waited from early morning to noon but didn’t see Dollar coming.</p>
        <p>“Shit, he must have fooled me!” Su Xiaoqiao was so upset that he
            was preparing to leave, but then heard someone say, “You brought
            cash?”</p>
        <p>Shocked, Su Xiaoqiao turned around and saw Dollar in golden
            armor emerging from below the ground.</p>
        <p>“Brother, did you hide there all morning?” Su Xiaoqiao said,
            staring at Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“I’ve been hiding here since last night. You know what’s going
            on right now, and I have to be careful,” Han Sen said casually.</p>
        <p>“I admire you Dollar, but you really have nothing to worry
            about. I’m so grateful you would sell me mutant flesh and would
            never betray you.”</p>
        <p>Su Xiaoqiao gave Han Sen the thumbs-up. It was incredible that
            he could stay underground for the whole night and the entire
            morning. It must have been so uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>“Cut the crap. Did you bring the money?” Han Sen pulled out
            another bundle from the pit where he was hiding and placed it in
            front of Xiaoqiao.</p>
        <p>Su Xiaoqiao looked inside the bundle, which was full of the same
            meat jerky he had eaten yesterday. There must have been more than
            five pounds of it. He excitedly asked, “Dollar, did you make all
            this from the mutant copper-toothed beast?”</p>
        <p>“Yep. An entire mutant copper-toothed beast is right here. Two
            million, and no bargaining,” Han Sen said.</p>
        <p>“Well, two million is fine.” Su Xiaoqiao handed two stacks of
            ten-thousand notes to Han Sen, but doubted whether the entire beast
            was really there, as there should have been more meat.</p>
        <p>Han Sen noticed his doubt, took the money and said, “This meat
            jerky is made in traditional ways, so it shrank a bit. Rest assured
            that the whole beast is here.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen made the copper-toothed beast into meat jerky so that no
            one would wonder why the beast was so tiny..</p>
        <p>“Of course I trust you!” Su Xiaoqiao paused and said, “Dollar,
            you should know that I work for Qin Xuan. She has a message for
            you: she wants to buy the sacred-blood beast soul and golden axe
            you gained the other day, and she could offer you a good
            price.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, what is the price?” Han Sen was interested in selling the
            golden axe, as it was not that portable. He hadn’t found a chance
            to use it, so it was still buried.</p>
        <p>“You will have to figure this out yourselves. I’m just the
            messenger,” Su Xiaoqiao shrugged and said.</p>
        <p>“If you meet with Qin Xuan, tell her if she really wants to buy
            it, she can name a price and you can bring it to me,” Han Sen said
            lightly. It was too risky for her to meet Qin Xuan.</p>
