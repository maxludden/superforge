        <p>“Ha-ha, why have the St. Germain team stopped commenting?”</p>
        <p>“Genius, well-done.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Blackhawk students became thrilled. Although they were not many,
            they soon filled the gap of the comments.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran was more excited than everyone else. Her face flushed,
            she waved her fist and cried, “Now you don’t dare to talk nonsense,
            do you?”</p>
        <p>“Impossible… that punch was clearly a white fist…” Li Yu’s face
            was dark.</p>
        <p>“Yu, don’t let down your guard. It seems that their new guy has
            some skills,” Xu Yundi urged Li Yu.</p>
        <p>Li Yu was a young talent who he thought could reach the level of
            Nalan and he lost a point to Blackhawk’s new guy, which was
            somewhat embarrassing for him.</p>
        <p>“Yes, coach!” Li Yu answered, took a deep breath, and once again
            turned to his opponent.</p>
        <p>Each round was best of five. And Li Yu had only lost a
            point.</p>
        <p>The game began again. Wen Xiuxiu continued to explain, “Looks
            like Black Fist Emperor was quite lucking, getting the first point.
            It must be because Li Yu was not paying attention…”</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Before Wen finished, Li Yu was once again sent into the air. The
            system also played the special effect of him being sent to the
            galaxy.</p>
        <p>Wen Xiuxiu was stunned, and so were the viewers. If they could
            explain Li’s first loss with his carelessness, the second loss was
            hard to justify.</p>
        <p>Those who were arguing with the Blackhawk students suddenly
            stopped. All that was left in the comments was support to
            Blackhawk.</p>
        <p>“Good job…”</p>
        <p>“This is a true black fist.”</p>
        <p>“Where did this Black Fist Emperor come from?”</p>
        <p>“Two consecutive black fists, and Windtalker could not tell
            either. Loser!”</p>
        <p>“That kid was trying to play tough and did not even block. Even
            the special effect changed, ha-ha.”</p>
        <p>“Our genius is the best.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Wen Xiuxiu did not dare to comment any more. When Li Yu came to
            the stage again, she was not as confident as she had been, “Black
            Fist Emperor is a very good player, and this will be a fight
            between two powerful teams…”</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>Another loud bang. Li Yu did raise his arms this time, so the
            special effect was not as dramatic. But the system still showed his
            image sliding backward more than 30 feet. There were even sparks
            from the friction.</p>
        <p>Although it was only a virtual special effect, many still got
            excited over it.</p>
        <p>“Shit! Three consecutive black fists and Windtalker was
            gone.”</p>
        <p>“So impressive. Three consecutive black fists and Windtalker did
            not see it coming.”</p>
        <p>“Where is he from?”</p>
        <p>“Wow! The St. Germain player was eliminated with zero point by a
            new player at Blackhawk.”</p>
        <p>“Young players do not have the psychological quality. He lost
            the first point and continued to make mistakes and forgot to
            dodge.”</p>
        <p>“That was just a new player. What you are proud of? Next round
            Wang Yangjun would show you St. Germain’s strength.”</p>
        <p>“Young people cannot be trusted with important tasks because
            they lack experience.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>“Yu, what’s wrong? The other player had been using black fists.
            Why didn’t you dodge?” Xu Yundi was upset.</p>
        <p>His favorite student was eliminated zero to three. That was a
            shame on him.</p>
        <p>“I am sorry, coach.” Li Yu was bitter. He knew that it was
            likely that his opponent would repeatedly use black fist, but no
            matter how he saw it, he still felt Han Sen was using white fist,
            and could not bring himself to move away.</p>
        <p>Li Yu thought Han Sen was going to use black fist but he
            judgment told him it was a white fist. In the end, his judgment
            trumped his instinct. And that was why he had lost.</p>
        <p>“Do not be sad. I will avenge you.” Wang Yangjun laughed, patted
            Li’s shoulder and went up.</p>
        <p>“Remember, since his name is Black Fist Emperor, he must be very
            confident in his black fists. Be careful and dodge when necessary,”
            Xu Yundi said.</p>
        <p>“Understood.” Wang Yangjun nodded and sat in the holographic
            equipment.</p>
        <p>Wang Yangjun had quite a lot of faith in himself. Li Yu could
            not see his opponent’s intention because he lacked experience,
            whereas Wang was had been in so many competitions that he would
            never fail here.</p>
        <p>“Boy, now I will show you the true strength of St. Germain.
            Black Fist Emperor, I will reduce you to Black Fist Eunuch.” Wang
            Yangjun stood opposite Han Sen confidently.</p>
        <p>Because it was an arena match, Wang Yangjun followed Li Yu to
            become the second player, and was automatically determined to be
            the defensive side, which was also a compensation mechanism for the
            party which had to fight continuously.</p>
        <p>“Windtalker is lacking in experience, but Wang Yangjun is a
            veteran, so that Black Fist Emperor’s tactics would not work that
            easily.” Wen Xiuxiu’s tone was no longer confident.</p>
        <p>But she still believed that Wang Yangjun had a bigger chance of
            winning, and was more optimistic about the St. Germain team.</p>
        <p>“That woman started babbling again.” Qu Lili bristled.</p>
        <p>“Let her talk. The facts will prove everything.” Ji Yanran was
            calm this time. Han Sen had promised her he would win, and she
            believed him.</p>
        <p>The game started again. Han Sen threw a punch out that looked
            extremely fierce.</p>
        <p>Wang Yangjun looked carefully, and felt just like Li Yu did.
            From many details he could tell it should be a white fist, and he
            should not dodge.</p>
        <p>However, after watching the match between Li Yu and Han Sen,
            Wang told himself, “That was how Li Yu lost, and I cannot make the
            same mistake.”</p>
        <p>Then he moved backward to avoid the punch from Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Wang Yangjun is worthy of his fame. His tactical goal is clear
            and his execution is also in place. This blow should be…” When Wen
            Xiuxiu was in the middle of her passionate commentary, she suddenly
            stopped.</p>
        <p>Beep!</p>
        <p>Han Sen’s fist froze in the air, and a sign of a white fist lit
            up.</p>
        <p>“How could it be a white fist!” Wen Xiuxiu shout out loud, her
            eyes wide.</p>
