        <p>“Thank you for the chance.” Han Sen smiled and threw a punch at
            the young man.</p>
        <p>The young man looked at Han Sen’s fist, curled his lips, smiled
            contemptuously, and countered Han Sen’s strike with his fist.</p>
        <p>With his fitness level as an evolver, he was much stronger than
            a normal unevolved person. He could bully his opponents as he
            wanted using his advantage in fitness, the satisfaction of which
            made him linger in the unevolved section.</p>
        <p>As long as they did not use those hyper geno arts that only
            evolvers could practice, there was no way for anyone to tell they
            were evolvers. People would only think that they were strong
            unevolved persons.</p>
        <p>Seeing the two fists were about to clash, the young man was even
            more excited. Fist against fist, he could break all the bones in
            his opponent’s fingers, and sometimes even the entire arm.</p>
        <p>As the two fists were about to bump, Han Sen turned his fist
            into a claw, twisted the young man’s wrist, and dislocated it. The
            young man’s arm was twisted back and had to turn his back to Han
            Sen.</p>
        <p>Twisting his arm, Han Sen kicked the young man in the knee pits
            and made him kneel. With one arm controlled by Han Sen, the young
            man could not even stand up, otherwise his entire arm would be
            wasted.</p>
        <p>As an evolver, the young man did have some remarkable abilities.
            He quickly hit back and tried to get rid of Han Sen’s hand.</p>
        <p>However, Han Sen had improved his grappling skills tremendously
            since his combat with Xu Zhu. An evolver with a fitness index just
            above 20 was not comparable to Han Sen at all.</p>
        <p>Han Sen released the young man’s arm and followed the young man.
            Putting his arm around the young man’s neck, Han Sen threw his
            opponent in the air head down.</p>
        <p>As his opponent was falling, Han Sen’s fists hit the young man’s
            body as fast as lightning bolts, from the face to the stomach. When
            the young man was about to touch the ground, Han Sen kicked him in
            the chest with a knee, throwing him into the air again.</p>
        <p>Sweeping up and down, Han Sen’s legs became a blur, kicking the
            young man as if he were a punching sack. Before the young man
            landed, his health value was burned up. His body exploded in the
            air, and he was eliminated.</p>
        <p>His friend, the tall, slim guy became dumbstruck, unable to
            believe that the young man would be kicked to the point of
            explosion by a military school student.</p>
        <p>Even though the students did not know that they were evolvers,
            he knew very well that it was impossible for his friend to
            lose.</p>
        <p>The students started to cheer and welcomed Han Sen back to the
            stands as if they were receiving a hero.</p>
        <p>Han Sen stared at the tall, slim young man and asked, “Do you
            want to fight me as well?”</p>
        <p>“No need… No need…” The tall and slim guy became pale, he was
            not even as good as his friend. Since his friend exploded, of
            course he did not have the nerve to fight Han Sen himself.</p>
        <p>“Why? Didn’t you enjoy this game very much?” Han Sen said
            calmly.</p>
        <p>Feeling nervous, the tall and slim guy exclaimed, “We are out of
            form today. Doesn’t mean we won’t win next time.”</p>
        <p>“Will you use your evolver’s identity to fight next time, or the
            unevolved?” Han Sen asked.</p>
        <p>Hearing Han Sen’s words, the students were dazed.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, you’re saying that they are evolvers?” Shi Zhikang
            looked at the two young men incredulously.</p>
        <p>“You are evolvers?” All the students were mad at them. Bullying
            others using false identities was simply contemptible.</p>
        <p>“Who is an evolver? Don’t talk crap here…” The two young men of
            course chose to deny being evolvers, otherwise they would be in
            trouble.</p>
        <p>“Indeed, you have not evolved much,” said Han Sen casually.</p>
        <p>The two did not speak any more and chose to leave Gladiator.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, were they evolvers or not?” The students were
            puzzled.</p>
        <p>“When I went to observe in the evolver section, I have seen them
            before. But I’m not so sure if they are actually evolvers.” Han Sen
            shrugged and made up an excuse.</p>
        <p>“I think they are evolvers, but the scum type. Otherwise they
            would not have pretended to be an unevolved person to bully
            others.”</p>
        <p>“Garbage.”</p>
        <p>“Shameless.”</p>
        <p>"Genius, your movements were awesome, especially the last round
            of kicks. You need to teach us when you have time. All the students
            were impressed by Han Sen. Even scum evolvers were evolvers. It was
            still difficult for an unevolved person to beat them.</p>
        <p>After fighting the students a few rounds and giving them some
            suggestion, Han Sen entered the evolver section, because he was not
            the least interested in the unevolved opponents.</p>
        <p>As soon as possible he did, he received an invite to fight.</p>
        <p>Han Sen thought it was those who had lost to him, but was
            dumbstruck by the ID name.</p>
        <p>The ID looked very familiar, but it was not the two persons that
            he had beaten before.</p>
        <p>It was a one-word ID: Queen.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had never seen such an ID, but he remembered this
            name.</p>
        <p>A while back, Huangfu Pingqing had taken him to a restaurant
            named Queen Restaurant once, which was the property of Ares Martial
            Hall. Han Sen saw an evolver with the nickname Queen there in the
            restaurant, who destroyed an evolver opponent momentarily with
            incredible skills and power.</p>
        <p>“Is this the same Queen?” With some doubt, Han Sen clicked yes
            and entered a fighting scene.</p>
