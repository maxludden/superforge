<p>“Han Sen!” Su Xiaoqiao suddenly became pale. If Mr. Yu were to
attack Han Sen, there was no way Han Sen could beat an evolver.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat still on the three-eyed beast. He had already sold
the tornado wolf, and Meowth was not the best ride, which was why
Han Sen had been riding three-eyed beast on this trip.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu’s was holding a beast soul sword, which looked like a
sacred-blood beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen squinted his eyes at Mr. Yu’s sword, which was exactly
what he needed at this point.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu rushed to Han Sen, cutting his silver sword at Han Sen’s
neck like a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Those with Mr. Yu did not move. It seemed they were enjoying the
show. Mr. Yu was an evolver, so there was no one who could threaten
him in First God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Shortly, everyone opened their eyes wide. As the sword was about
to cut Han Sen snack, Han Sen suddenly reached out a hand and
clipped the sword with two fingers.</p>
<p>Everyone thought Han Sen was crazy. No one should be able to
clip an incoming sword with two fingers, especially when it was an
evolver who was holding the sword.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu’s uses more force their usual, trying to kill Han Sen
directly.</p>
<p>The moment the sort touched Han Sen’s fingers, it seemed that
Han Sen’s entire body became weightless. He attached himself to the
sword and moved along with the sword wherever it went as if he was
a fallen leaf.</p>
<p>Feeling shocked, Mr. Yu’s took the sword back and threw a punch
at Han Sen who had approached him with the sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen hit Mr. Yu’s fist, jumped up and landed behind Mr. Yu,
his skeleton’s dagger on Mr. Yu’s neck.</p>
<p>“It seems that an evolver like you is no big deal,” said Han Sen
lightly.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Yu’s had the best geno point count, he was terrible
at martial arts. He was probably from a rich family, but he was
scum himself, which was different from Yuan and Qing.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu’s was dazed, and others were dumbstruck. No one could
foresee that an evolver was easily beaten by Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do you want to live or die?” Han Sen moved the dagger forward
slightly with a smile. The sharp blade immediately cut the skin of
Mr. Yu’s neck, a drop of blood gliding down the dagger.</p>
<p>“What should I do for you if I want to live?” Mr. Yu became
pale, and none in his group dared to move.</p>
<p>“I am a fair person and could offer you an opportunity to
correct yourself. However, if I let you go just like this, I’m
afraid you will not learn your lesson. So, a sword for your
life–the one you’re holding right now,” said Han Sen.</p>
<p>“No way! My dad is the CEO of Dongchang. If you lay a hand on
me, my dad will kill your entire family,” yelled Mr. Yu
fiercely.</p>
<p>Han Sen almost burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“All right. When you go to hell, remember to appear in your
dad’s dream and tell him that it was Han Sen who killed you.” Han
Sen pushed the skeleton dagger deeper into Mr. Yu’s skin.</p>
<p>“No… You can have it…” Mr. Yu exclaimed, almost scared to
death.</p>
<p>“This is your last chance. When I count to three, if the sword
is not in my hand, you can keep it with you in hell.” Han Sen
started to count, “One… Two…”</p>
<p>Mr. Yu’s did not even dare to bargain and quickly transferred
the beast soul sword to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do not claim to be an evolver next time, so that you will not
lose face for all evolvers.” Han Sen took back the sword and the
skeleton’s daggers and returned to the back of his mutant three
eyed beast.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Yu gained his freedom again, he quickly summoned a
beast soul knife and led his followers to attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Go back,” said Han Sen casually. He had foreseen this outcome
and quickly rushed to the group of people.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu did not want to recognize the fact that he was weaker
than Han Sen. I should not have lost. Thought Mr. Yu.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Yu’s had a lot of good men on his team, so he
believed he must be able to kill Han Sen this time and avenge
himself.</p>
<p>However, when Han Sen was in the middle of them, Mr. Yu started
to regret, because he found that the group were not a help, but a
burden. Han Sen walked casually among them, and for some reason,
they could more easily hurt their teammates than Han Sen. Every
time Han Sen brandished the skeleton’s daggers, an injury would be
made.</p>
<p>Momentarily, six persons were hurt in the group.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoqiao was dumbfound. The way Han Sen was doing it made him
wonder who the evolver was.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was terrified. He could not describe the feeling he had.
Obviously, Han Sen was the one who was besieged. However, it felt
like Han Sen was actually behind the siege. Mr. Yu did not even
have any chance to attack Han Sen. Every time he tried to make a
move, he would be blocked by one of his own people.</p>
<p>Someone who had not really practiced martial arts could not tell
how incredible kiting skills were. In the eyes of Han Sen, people
like this could not give him any pressure no matter how many they
were.</p>
<p>“Get lost,” Mr. Yu exclaimed when he found there was no chance
to attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not chase after the rest of the group. When they had
left, a blue lightning bolt left Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>A mutant ghost butterfly boomerang flew toward Mr. Yu who was
throwing himself at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu tried to cut the boomerang in half, but when his weapon
was about to touch the boomerang, it quickly made a weird turn and
disappeared in front of his eyes. Bypassing Mr. Yu’s knife, the
boomerang hit his chest hard.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Blue flames exploded on Mr. Yu’s chest, making him fall from his
mount and roll around on the ground.</p>
