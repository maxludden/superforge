<h2>Overload</h2>
<h3>Chapter 321</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought back on the turtle’s bite, which was so fast
that it was incredulous. With Han Sen’s current speed, there was no
way that he could dodge a bite like that. He knew it without even
trying. As long as he was within the range of attack of the turtle,
he would be killed for sure.</p>
<p>“I need to get faster and stronger.” Han Sen pondered how he
should achieve those two goals.</p>
<p>Heresy Mantra could enhance his strength and speed, but Han Sen
had not completed the third phase longevity yet. Therefore, he had
to find another path.</p>
<p>Sparticle was out of the question. He had to use a faster
footwork. At least the footwork should allow him to dodge the
turtle bite, otherwise stronger force meant nothing. He had to
survive first. Han Sen did not go back to Steel Armor Shelter.
Hiding the spinning spear and the skeleton’s daggers in a remote
cave, he teleported back to Blackhawk from Glory Shelter.</p>
<p>Gears were not beast souls and could not be brought out of God’s
Sanctuary. There was simply no way around it.</p>
<p>After returning to school, Han Sen logged in the special squad’s
platform online. Currently, Han Sen had more than 100 points as the
head of special squad, so it should be easy for him to buy several
S-Class hyper geno arts. Han Sen slowly browsed all the available
S-Class hyper geno arts, wishing to find some that would be helpful
to improve his strength and speed.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to find a footwork faster than
Sparticle. After all, Sparticle was already a top-notch
footwork.</p>
<p>Although there were many techniques in Panorama, they were all
fundamental skills and could not enhance a certain ability
significantly. Panorama focused on slow, long-term improvement of
one’s fitness.</p>
<p>A significant improvement in a short amount of time should be
something more like Heresy Mantra.</p>
<p>Han Sen viewed the available S-Class footwork and did not find a
single one that could surpass Sparticle. However, Han Sen did not
give up but continued to look for it. He decided that he would ask
for Bai Yishan’s help if he could not find one.</p>
<p>To Han Sen’s surprise, after checking the footwork all
afternoon, he found a super geno art called Overload which brought
him some hope.</p>
<p>The theory of Overload was to make one’s body work under extreme
conditions that went beyond one’s limits. It was to burn one’s
energy to tap into one’s potentials. The more burden one’s body
could handle, the stronger one’s force would be.</p>
<p>It was somewhat like an overlock of the processor or graphics
cards in ancient computers. It was to reset some computer component
so that it ran faster than the manufacturer-specified speed, from
2.0 to 3.0, or even 3.5 or higher.</p>
<p>However, by doing that, the burden on one’s body would be
heavily increased. Undertaking the Overload, the body would be
inclined to collapse.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Overload could increase one’s abilities
without limit. However, if the body could not take it, one would
die from using Overload.</p>
<p>Fitness was the key in practicing Overload. The better the
fitness, the greater the potentials. In addition, one must control
the level of the Overload, otherwise one’s body would be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have too much time to consider. Overload was the
most effective way for him to improve at this time.</p>
<p>It was even more direct than Heresy Mantra. Overload could
increase the speed and strength greatly in a very short amount of
time. However, Heresy Mantra had no side effects, while Overload
was dangerous to practice.</p>
<p>With Overload, Han Sen did not need to learn another footwork.
When he used both Overload and Sparticle, he could probably dodge
the turtle bite.</p>
<p>Han Sen used 30 credits at the special squad to purchase
Overload, which he was happy about. He was willing to spend on
anything that would help him improve himself.</p>
<p>The idea of becoming the first evolver with super geno points
maxed out made Han Sen burn with passion.</p>
<p>The geno solution of Overload would be delivered to Blackhawk
the next day, so Han Sen downloaded the tutorial of Overload
first.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what are you doing?” Shi Zhikang saw Han Sen in the
dorm and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Just looking at the tutorial of some hyper geno art,” replied
Han Sen casually.</p>
<p>“Could you hold on the second and do me a small favor first?”
Shi Zhikang asked in a wheedling tone.</p>
<p>“What favor? It can’t be too time-consuming,” said Han Sen with
a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s not. It would be so easy for you,” said Shi Zhikang with
his arm over Han Sen’s shoulder. “Aren’t you a frequent visitor to
the Gladiator platform?”</p>
<p>“Yes, what about it? If you want to try it, you could register
an account there as well. The registration fee is not high.” Han
Sen did not understand what the favor was.</p>
<p>“I have become a member… But, you know, I’m not that great a
fighter…” Shi Zhikang stuttered.</p>
<p>“Then you need to practice more. Didn’t you register to
practice?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“It might be a little late for that. That’s why I want to ask
you a favor.” Shi Zhikang blushed and told Han Sen what
happened.</p>
<p>“Aren’t your girlfriend from the Warframe Department? When did
she change her major to martial arts?” Han Sen looked Shi Zhikang
up and down. This hunk was much better at romantic affairs than Han
Sen. As far as Han Sen knew, Shi Zhikang had had six different
girlfriends already.</p>
<p>At this point, Shi Zhikang’s girlfriend was in Martial Arts
Department and often went to Gladiator with friends. Although Shi
Zhikang had great strength, he could not compare to those who were
in martial arts major, which was why he wanted Han Sen to back him
up.</p>
<p>“All right, I intended to go on Gladiator anyway,” Han Sen
agreed.</p>
