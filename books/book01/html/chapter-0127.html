<h2>The Girl Worth an S-Class License</h2>
<h3>Chapter 127</h3>

<p>The reason he chose Devil Desert was that there were not many
creatures that could fly, hence it was relatively safe for Han Sen
who could. Few people would go there, so there was no shortage of
mutant creatures, if not sacred-blood creatures.</p>
<p>Han Sen studied the conditions of the desert and was ready to
ask Qin Xuan for a leave. Qin Xuan smiled and said, “Perfect. Our
squad needs to protect someone in hunting and I was just thinking
where we should take her. You could lead the team to Devil Desert
then. It is your first task in the squad, make sure you do a good
job.”</p>
<p>“What is the reward for this task?” Han Sen blinked and asked,
he did not want to do a job that would not pay well.</p>
<p>“If you can make the girl satisfied and designate you as her
protector in Steel Armor Shelter, you could get an S-Class license
of Saint Hall.” Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen and laughed. “Any
interest?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am very interested,” Han Sen quickly said. Babysitting
alone would pay an S-Class license. Such a good thing could only
happen in a dream.</p>
<p>“Then do well. You will get nothing if she is not satisfied with
you.” Qin Xuan handed him the portfolio.</p>
<p>After reading the materials, Han Sen felt he did not learn
anything, as these people’s personal information was all
confidential. All he knew was the name, age and gender.</p>
<p>“Wang Mengmeng, female, 16 years and 47 days old. Stationmaster,
you are not asking me to take a girl who has just entered God’s
Sanctuary to a place like Devil Desert. I can’t guarantee her
safety.” Han Sen looked sullen.</p>
<p>“Of course not. This is your first task, so I will ask Gambler
to follow you. You could also pick some people from Steel Armor
Shelter.” Qin Xuan smiled. “About Wang Mengmeng, I can tell you one
more thing. She is your schoolmate.”</p>
<p>“My schoolmate? Blackhawk? You must be kidding me. She just
entered God’s Sanctuary and with that kind of fitness, she could
not even have reached the standard for any special enrolment
program.” Han Sen did not believe her.</p>
<p>“Some people do not need to pass the exam. We all have different
starting points, like you are to protect her, and she is to be
protected.” Qin Xuan smiled. “Remember to keep a good relationship
with her.”</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in little girls,” Han Sen shrugged and
said.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan rolled her eyes at him and said, “Go pick some team
members in Steel Armor Gang. You can choose anyone but the team
leaders. There should be less than ten members and the fees will be
covered by the squad.”</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Su Xiaoqiao and some others who had a mutant
mount. He did not want to waste his time on walking and would not
consider those without mounts.</p>
<p>As for Gambler, Han Sen was confident in him. He was an old
member in the squad and had amazing skills, like Sleeveblade.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw Wang Mengmeng, he finally knew what privileges
meant. A girl just over 16 who had just entered God’s Sanctuary for
one month had mutant shapeshifting beast soul, mutant armor, mutant
weapon and one sacred-blood beast soul mount, making Han Sen and
the rest rather jealous.</p>
<p>Although Lin Beifeng was rich, he was only an upstart when
compared with Wang Mengmeng. The beast souls she had probably could
not be bought with money.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wang Mengmeng was not an annoying princess. She was
delightful and lovely.</p>
<p>She also fought well. Although she had only been in God’s
Sanctuary for a month, it looked like that she had gained quite a
few geno points already. She must have practiced multiple advanced
hyper geno arts since childhood.</p>
<p>Using her advanced beast souls, she could probably beat Su
Xiaoqiao in a combat.</p>
<p>The team had been traveling all the time and Wang Mengmeng never
complained.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, I heard from Sister Qin that you are also in
Blackhawk. I’m in Department of Warframe, which department are you
in?” Wang Mengmeng called Han Sen brother in a natural and sweet
tone.</p>
<p>In fact, kids from prominent families like Wang Mengmeng, Qing
and Yuan were all quite well mannered and easy going.</p>
<p>“Ahem, you can call me Sen. I was enrolled this year as well. We
are both freshmen and I am an archery major.” Han Sen enjoyed
talking to an adorable girl like her, which make the journey less
boring.</p>
<p>“Archery Department is the department our school is trying to
enhance this year and I’m sure the change will happen fast. You
must be specially enrolled?” Wang Mengmeng started to chat with
him.</p>
<p>“Oh right, Brother Han, you came to Steel Armor Shelter early,
so you must have seen Dollar himself?” Wang Mengmeng asked
hopefully.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have all seen him at the contest. Why do you ask about
him?” Han Sen looked at Wang Mengmeng, surprised.</p>
<p>“I am a fan of Dollar’s, but unfortunately he never showed up
since I came here, so I never got to see him,” Wang Mengmeng said
with some disappointment.</p>
<p>Wang Mengmeng asked again, “Brother Han, can you tell me
something about Dollar?”</p>
<p>“Ahem, I have no way of knowing. You have to ask him, because he
knows everything.” Han Sen pointed to Su Xiaoqiao.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoqiao quickly thumped his chest and said, “What do you
want to know? I’m Dollar’s buddy and it was me who named him
Dollar.”</p>
<p>“Wow, then you must know what Dollar really looks like? He must
be very handsome?” Wang Mengmeng looked at Su Xiaoqiao happily.</p>
<p>“Handsome, of course, he is most handsome. He has wide chest,
long legs and nice round bottom…” Su Xiaoqiao babbled on and Han
Sen almost wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>It took them four days to reach Devil Desert. Wang Mengmeng had
nice skills and was improving very fast in hunting.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Gambler were always shadowing her. Even when she was
fighting with a creature, Gambler was always following her and Han
Sen’s bow and arrow were always ready to rescue her.</p>
<p>If something happened to her, the entire squad including Qin
Xuan would be in trouble, so Han Sen did not dare to slack at
all.</p>
<p>The next afternoon after they had entered the desert, Su
Xiaoqiao who was the scout cried in surprise, “A mutant
creature!”</p>
<p>Everyone quickly urged their mounts on and saw a fox-like,
fire-red and golden-horned creature the size of a tiger barking at
them.</p>
<p>“It is mine.” It was the first time Wang Mengmeng had seen a
living mutant creature. She put away her mount and charged the
mutant creature with a pair of mutant beast soul lancets in her
hands.</p>
