        <p>“You’re quite tough…” Han Sen gave Zhu Ting a thumbs-up and
            grappled at him again.</p>
        <p>Zhu Ting suddenly screamed and twitched like crazy. The pain was
            unbearable for any normal person.</p>
        <p>Although Zhu Ting had a pain threshold much higher than a normal
            person, he couldn’t stop screaming either.</p>
        <p>“All I’m telling you… Is true… I really don’t know anything
            else… It’s just a message from older generations in the family…”
            Zhu Ting screamed and said in broken sentences.</p>
        <p>Han Sen stopped and asked, “What is it?”</p>
        <p>“Do not lift your hand again. Ask whatever you want, and I will
            tell you everything.” Zhu Ting felt scared.</p>
        <p>“Cut the crap,” Han Sen said impatiently.</p>
        <p>Zhu Ting was so depressed at this point. What Han Sen was asking
            was no secret. He did not mean to hide anything. Being tortured by
            Han Sen, he doubted whether Han Sen had more interest in torturing
            him than knowing the answers.</p>
        <p>Pervert! Moron! Idiot! Zhu Ting cursed Han Sen with all the
            words he knew inwardly, but replied in compliance, “I don’t know
            much about it. I just heard from the older generations that when
            God’s Sanctuary was first discovered, my ancestor found something
            that proved there should be another level beyond sacred-blood. The
            Chens had worked hard to prove that speculation, but the creatures
            we suspect to be of the higher level are simply so strong that no
            weapons in First God’s Sanctuary could hurt them…”</p>
        <p>“Isn’t your family name Zhu? How come you are one of the Chens?”
            Han Sen gazed at Zhu Ting.</p>
        <p>“I’m a bastard, so I took my mother’s family name. Do you know
            Chen Zichen? We have the same father,” Zhu Ting said hastily.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was not interested to know whether Zhu Ting was actually
            one of the Chens. He thought about it and continued to ask, “Why
            did you become a spy in Starry Group? Don’t tell me it’s because
            that’s fun.”</p>
        <p>Zhu Ting became pale and said, “Since I have told you
            everything, there’s no point in hiding this. The ancestor of the
            Nings worked in the same department as my ancestor. When they
            discovered those things, they were together, which was why the
            Nings had the same speculation and had also paid a lot to prove
            it.”</p>
        <p>“You know that Starry Group is very strong, and the Chens are
            not on the same level as them. With me as the spy, if they
            discovered something, we could also benefit from it…” Zhu Ting
            paused and did not continue.</p>
        <p>“What is the name of the department?” Han Sen asked casually,
            but his heart was racing, because he thought of the work permit of
            his great grandpa.</p>
        <p>“How on earth would I know that… It was such a long time ago…”
            Seeing Han Sen’s face became grim, Zhu Ting added, “I heard it’s
            something rather secretive…”</p>
        <p>“The full name,” exclaimed Han Sen coldly, feeling excited
            inwardly.</p>
        <p>What’s Zhu Ting was talking about the seemed to be the Secret
            Service written on the work permit. If that was true, then he could
            start to piece together what had happened.</p>
        <p>His great grandpa, the man of the Nings, and the man of the
            Chens, should be working in the same department. Very likely, they
            found something in God’s Sanctuary. Since Han Sen’s great grandpa
            left the words “super gene,” maybe the other two persons had left
            the same message, or even more details.</p>
        <p>After all, the work permit of Han Sen’s grandpa showed that he
            was just an investigator. Maybe the other two persons were the team
            leads. Otherwise, it would be hard to explain why Starry Group had
            accumulated such fortune in a few generations.</p>
        <p>“I really don’t know. My father mentioned it randomly. You know
            that I am just a bastard son and have not spent any time in the
            clan. How would I have any chance to know about the family secrets?
            If they didn’t need me to become a spy, I wouldn’t have learned
            these either,” said Zhu Ting bitterly.</p>
        <p>Han Sen asked Zhu Ting a few more questions but did not manage
            to get more information.</p>
        <p>Han Sen knew that Zhu Ting was still hiding a lot of
            information, but he understood that it would be hard to tell the
            truth from the lie if Zhu Ting said more. So far, Han Sen did learn
            some useful things from Zhu Ting.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Han, I have told you everything you want to know. Please
            let me go,” Zhu Ting begged.</p>
        <p>“Since it is none of my business that you are a spy, I would
            have let you go. However, you tried to hurt me, so I can’t just do
            that. I will hand you over to Yang Yongcheng, and it’s up to you
            whether you can live or not,” Han Sen smiled and said.</p>
        <p>Zhu Ting suddenly shuddered, gritted his teeth and said, “Mr.
            Han, how about I pay for my own life. Could you name the
            price?”</p>
        <p>The thought of Ning Yue made Zhu Ting shudder. If he ended up in
            Ning’s hand, he would rather die.</p>
        <p>Although Han Sen was cruel, he was as lovely as a child in the
            kindergarten compared to Ning Yue, according to what Zhu Ting knew
            about the young master.</p>
        <p>“All right. So, tell me what is your worth? You are the young
            master of the Chens, so you wouldn’t let me down, right?” Han Sen
            looked at Zhu Ting, curious.</p>
        <p>“I am just a bastard son, and no young master. What kind of
            young master would risk his life like this… 100 million for my
            life, what do you think?” Zhu Ting gritted his teeth and said.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not speak but smiled at Zhu Ting.</p>
        <p>“200 million?” Zhu Ting said the number as if he were selling
            his own daughter.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think you really want to live.” Han Sen immediately
            walked to Yang Yongcheng, checking whether he was about to wake
            up.</p>
        <p>No matter how Zhu Ting yelled, Han Sen ignored him. It was
            impossible that Zhu Ting had brought so much cash with him in God’s
            Sanctuary. Han Sen did not believe he had even 20,000. Just by
            listening to Zhu Ting, Han Sen knew that he did not plan to
            pay.</p>
