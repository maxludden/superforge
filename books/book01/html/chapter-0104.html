<h2>Not Bad</h2>
<h3>Chapter 104</h3>

<p>On the stage, Yi Dongmu coldly stared at Han Sen and said in a
flat voice, “Well, since you dare to come, then get ready to
die.”</p>
<p>Drawing the dagger from his waist, Yi had a murderous look on
his face.</p>
<p>“Do you think this is some Kung Fu movie?” Han Sen scoffed
inwardly. He didn’t believe someone would actually say such
dramatic words in real life.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not reply, but shapeshifted into the bloody slayer,
grabbed the hilt of the Shura katana and ran toward Yi Dongmu.</p>
<p>The bloody slayer had a great speed, and was as fast as a
fighter aircraft at its full speed. Instantaneously Dollar was in
Yi’s face.</p>
<p>The viewers all wondered whether Dollar had lost his mind to
approach Yi, who was best at close combat. Almost no one could
avoid his fatal blow after being approached by him.</p>
<p>“Wow… Dollar is nuts. He not only approached Yi, but was also
using a katana. At least use your spear so that you can keep the
distance.”</p>
<p>“A misstep by Dollar. He should have come with a bow and arrows.
Even if he doesn’t know archery, shooting down from the above is a
thousand times better than getting close to Yi.”</p>
<p>Yi’s fans were overjoyed. “This idiot wanders so willingly into
Yi’s lap. It would be hard not to beat him.”</p>
<p>Yi Dongmu sneered and shapeshifted into a mutant monkey more
than six feet tall with a thick tail, which greatly improved his
strength and speed.</p>
<p>Yi Dongmu had a sacred-blood shapeshifting beast soul as well,
but it was not similar to the shape of a human body. If he could
not use his skills and sacred-blood dagger, the sacred-blood
shapeshifting beast soul would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>There were few creatures that had the shape close to human, and
even fewer that looked human. Except for that sacred-blood beast
soul in the shape of a lady that was awarded to the Chosen, there
was hardly any sacred-blood beast soul that takes human form.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s bloody slayer was a precious sacred-blood
shapeshifting beast soul because it had a pair of human hands that
allowed him to use all sorts of techniques.</p>
<p>Yi Dongmu watched Han Sen bolting toward him and gave his dagger
a harder grip. He held the sacred-blood dagger backhanded and
launched his body at Han Sen. The distance between the two was
shorter and shorter.</p>
<p>All the moves of Yi Dongmu fell in the eyes of Han Sen, who felt
every stretch and twist of his opponent had followed his
expectation. He could see through Yi as if Yi was no more than a
puppet.</p>
<p>Between two assassins, if one was much better, something like
this would happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew everything about Yi while Yi didn’t even know Han
Sen was good at sneak attacks as well. And that had determined Yi’s
loss.</p>
<p>It did not matter that his speed and strength were both greater
than Han Sen.</p>
<p>When the two clashed, the katana painted golden by Han Sen moved
and was suddenly returned to its sheath. The movements of the
weapon were as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water.</p>
<p>They continued sliding nearly 30 feet in opposite directions
before they stopped. Han Sen’s magnificent body was as steady as a
mountain, while Yi Dongmu slowly turned around and stared at Han
Sen’s back. He stressed each syllable, “What is that skill
called?”</p>
<p>“Bladestorm.” Han Sen replied without looking back.</p>
<p>“I will fight you again. And next time I will not lose.” Yi said
and walked down the stage. The moment he went down, he fell to the
ground with a thump. Blood was welling from a cut in his chest so
deep that his bones could be seen.</p>
<p>The entire First God’s Sanctuary went quiet. Billions of viewers
of the match opened their mouths but could not make a sound.</p>
<p>No one could believe that the result would be like this. They
could accept it if it was the other way, but Yi Dongmu who was
invincible like a king was defeated by Dollar in one blow, which
was hard to swallow.</p>
<p>Not to mention Yi’s fans, even Dollar’s fans had never thought
that Dollar could win like this. Even the optimistic ones believed
it would at least take Dollar quite some effort to win.</p>
<p>But no one thought that Yi would lose in such a shameful way and
in his strong suit, close combat.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned his head back and looked at Yi Dongmu who was
struggling to get back on his feet. He said calmly, “Not bad. You
survived a serious strike from me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen turned away.</p>
<p>“Not bad… not bad…”</p>
<p>This sentence blew all the viewers’ minds. In the eyes of the
public, Dollar’s figure suddenly became more and more grand and
brilliant.</p>
<p>“Dollar…” Dollars’ fans finally came to realization of what had
happened and started shouting and jumping up and down.</p>
<p>The silence was broken and the entire First God’s Sanctuary
became festive. Everyone was talking about this incredible
fight.</p>
<p>“That went down pretty fast!”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, in your face, Yi’s fans!”</p>
<p>"Not just the fans, but also the media in the entire Alliance,
except for Fang Mingquan’s Contest Center. Y’all thought Yi was
gonna win. How about this? He is beat before even getting to top
10… "</p>
<p>“Now think about it, Fang Mingquan sure had some vision. His
analysis actually made a lot of sense. We were just blinded by Yi
Dongmu’s performance and didn’t listen.”</p>
<p>“Lin Feng is the visionary one. No wonder he was the runner-up
last year. He knew this long ago.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, it seems this year it will be between Lin Feng and
Dollar.”</p>
<p>“We really owe Fang Mingquan and Dollar an apology.”</p>
<p>“Fang Mingquan was wronged.”</p>
<p>“Not bad… ha-ha… what a line…”</p>
<p>A match that took less than ten seconds had changed Dollar’s
image completely.</p>
<p>“What a line! Next time I have to try it–not bad, you survived a
serious strike from me.” Tang regretted that it was not him who
came up with the line.</p>
