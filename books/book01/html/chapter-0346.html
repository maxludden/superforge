        <p>Han Sen was convinced that he had strong potentials. After all,
            he had already gained super geno points.</p>
        <p>However, in order to tap into his potentials, he had to work
            extremely hard. He could understand his weaknesses and strengths
            better under extreme conditions with Overload. This way, he could
            develop his full potentials.</p>
        <p>A high level of understanding of his own body was necessary. He
            had to know exactly where he could work harder. Otherwise, he might
            push himself too hard so that his body would collapse.</p>
        <p>The process of practicing Overload was a process to learn how to
            control his body. He had to make sure that each bone, muscle, and
            body cell were working at the limits, but not over the limits,
            which was the ultimate goal.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Han Sen had not reach that level just yet. Because of
            Jadeskin, he had much better understanding and control of his body
            then an average person, which was conducive to his Overload
            practice.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, when he continued to push his limits, Han Sen
            felt he was making a big progress with Jadeskin as well. It seemed
            that he was about to complete the first stage.</p>
        <p>“Again…” When he had recovered, Han Sen once again turned on the
            gravity trainer and tried to make his body function better in sweat
            and heat.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had control himself very well so that his body would not
            be damaged, thanks to Jadeskin.</p>
        <p>“Brother Han, I will have a small party tomorrow. Would you
            come?” Wang Mengmeng asked Han Sen with her eyes wide.</p>
        <p>“What party?” Han Sen was puzzled.</p>
        <p>“You will know after you arrive. Please come!” Wang Mengmeng
            said.</p>
        <p>“Alright,” agreed Han Sen. Wang Mengmeng rarely asked him of
            anything. Since it was just a party, of course Han Sen would not
            turn her down.</p>
        <p>Wang Mengmeng was delighted and told Han Sen the time of the
            party and that she would come to pick him up.</p>
        <p>When it was time, Han Sen realized that the party was not on
            campus. Wang Mengmeng took Han Sen to a private garden with food
            and drinks already arranged. Han Sen found a spot and started to
            eat, while Wang Mengmeng went to change.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, how come you’re here?” someone exclaimed when seeing
            Han Sen in the garden.</p>
        <p>“Tang Zhenliu!” Han Sen was also dazed. He did not expect to see
            Tang Zhenliu there.</p>
        <p>“You’re connected to the Wangs?” Tang Zhenliu sat down next to
            Han Sen and asked.</p>
        <p>“Wang Mengmeng is my schoolmate. She was the one who invited me
            to this party,” Han Sen answered.</p>
        <p>Tang Zhenliu looked at Han Sen oddly and said, “You’re not
            telling me that you don’t know today is her birthday…”</p>
        <p>Han Sen was surprised and said, “Today is Mengmeng’s
            birthday?”</p>
        <p>“You really don’t know? Ha-ha, it seemed that you two were quite
            tight.” Tang Zhenliu patted Han Sen on the shoulder, laughing.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was a bit concerned. Had he known that it was Wang
            Mengmeng’s birthday, he would have prepared her a gift. But it
            might be too late for that. Han Sen searched his pockets and found
            nothing that he could give her.</p>
        <p>“Tang, do you have an extra present? Could I borrow some?” Han
            Sen looked to Tang Zhenliu expectantly.</p>
        <p>“I only have one gift. In addition, how can you borrow the
            present?” Tang Zhenliu said with his lips curled.</p>
        <p>Han Sen wanted to say something, but he saw more people entering
            the garden. They were mostly in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        <p>Among the men and women, Han Sen spotted Son of Heaven and
            Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
        <p>The birthday party was successful. And nobody paid Han Sen any
            mind. Han Sen continued to fill his stomach, while Tang Zhenliu was
            socializing with men and women in the high society.</p>
        <p>Son of Heaven had gained much more repose. He was no longer that
            domineering and overbearing person in Steel Armor Shelter.</p>
        <p>“When do you plan to evolve?” As Han Sen was eating, Son of
            Heaven walked to him and asked in a plain tone.</p>
        <p>“In two or three years,” Han Sen paused and answered. He felt
            like Son of Heaven had become a different person. Maybe he was
            possessed or something.</p>
        <p>Son of Heaven curled his lips into a strange smile. He raised a
            glass to his lips and sipped some wine. “I know what you’re
            thinking. But since I entered Second God’s Sanctuary, I no longer
            treated you as my enemy. My true enemy could only be an evolver,
            which you are not. As long as you do not enter Second God’s
            Sanctuary, you will not understand what true strength is and how
            naïve you are.”</p>
        <p>“In the future, if you are sent to Dark Lord Shelter, you can
            join my team. You’re a good archer and I need someone like you.
            Evolve soon and stop playing house in First God’s Sanctuary,” Son
            of Heaven said and patted Han Sen on the shoulder. Then he walked
            to a corner and sat down, observing the crowd in the party.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was surprised by Son of Heaven’s behaviors. If Son of
            Heaven wanted to kill him, he would not feel much. However, Son of
            Heaven no longer cared. This shift was alarming to Han Sen.</p>
        <p>Han Sen could feel that Son of Heaven no longer thought of him
            as an opponent. The guy treated Han Sen as a stone in the hand of a
            Go player. A player would never treat the stone as his opponent, or
            his enemy.</p>
        <p>“You only evolved a few years earlier, and that does not mean
            you are superior.” Han Sen curled his lips and did not treat Son of
            Heaven too seriously. If he entered Second God’s Sanctuary before
            he maxed out on his super geno points, that would be a real
            loss.</p>
