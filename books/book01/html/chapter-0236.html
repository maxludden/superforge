<p>“We can only know after a match,” replied Han Sen with a
smile.</p>
<p>The senior team members cast odd looks at him. If the comment
was from any other freshman, they would definitely tell the person
all about the bad performances of Blackhawk in history.</p>
<p>However, it was Han Sen who said it, so they remained silent.
After all, Han Sen was the genius on campus and had achieved great
success in other items. Deep down, they still felt contemptuous
about what Han Sen had said.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang was satisfied with Han Sen’s remark. She was glad to
see that at least one person had morale on her team. Blackhawk had
been a loser for so long that it was natural for the senior team
members to lose confidence.</p>
<p>“We will watch another video, also from an unevolved person.”
Situ Xiang played another video, the background of which was a
virtual gaming platform.</p>
<p>“It is the White Birds Forest from Sagittarius.” Someone
suddenly recognized that.</p>
<p>When the video started to play, Han Sen was surprised. It was
the video of him taking the White Birds Forest test.</p>
<p>“Who is this person? That’s so impressive!” Shi Zhikang stared
his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“This must be edited.”</p>
<p>“Is he really an unevolved person?”</p>
<p>“Is that also Jing Jiwu?”</p>
<p>“I have seen that. It is a real video and has been recognized by
Sagittarius.”</p>
<p>“I’ve also been to the scene, and was no match to that. Who is
he?”</p>
<p>“It is not important who he is. Do you think he’s weaker than
Jing Jiwu?” asked Situ Xiang.</p>
<p>“It is hard to say without a match.” Everyone started to ponder.
Jing Jiwu was indeed strong, but the person in the video was
equally good. It was very hard to tell who was the better
archer.</p>
<p>“Since someone is Jing Jiwu’s match, why can’t that be you?”
asked Situ Xiang.</p>
<p>No one replied. The teammates were all thinking, “How is it
possible that we have that kind of skills?”</p>
<p>Although they all understood Situ Xiang’s intention, they became
even more depressed after seeing how good other people were.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you think this person is stronger than you?” Situ
Xiang asked Han Sen. She wanted Han Sen to lead the team in this
tournament. If he did not have the resolve to win, she would have
to reconsider despite his good skills.</p>
<p>“I should be on more or less the same level.” Han Sen cleared
his throat and answered. It was him in the video, so of course it
was the same.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still wondering who had leaked the video.
Fortunately, his facial features were blurred, and no one could
tell it was him.</p>
<p>He did not think it was Qin Xuan, but who else would watch his
test and record it?</p>
<p>Han Sen did not mind either. It was fine if someone found out it
was him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s comment sounded arrogant to others. The level of the
guy in the video was clearly beyond that of a monitoring school
student. Although Han Sen did well in warframe and black and white
boxing, he rarely went to archery classes.</p>
<p>Like what Situ Xiang was thinking before, his teammates felt
unsure about Han Sen’s archery skills and were reluctant to believe
that he had the same skill level.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang was satisfied with his answer. She thought he was
confident, which was a great quality for someone to lead the team.
The senior team members were also good players. And they often lost
because of their lack of confidence.</p>
<p>“Fantastic. This year, our goal is to beat the Alliance Central
Military Academy. So, let’s work toward that.” Then Situ Xiang
announced the training plan and asked each player to follow
through.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you really think you can do the same?” Zhang Yang
asked Han Sen on their way back to the dormitory.</p>
<p>Shi Zhikang and Lu Meng also looked to Han Sen, interested to
hear his reply.</p>
<p>“Which video are you talking about?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“How about Jing Jiwu’s?” Zhang Yang widened his eyes. It sounded
like Han Sen thought he could match both.</p>
<p>“Jing Jiwu’s skills are hard to match. His fitness index is too
high. And I lack in physical strength compared to him.” After
watching Jing Jiwu’s video, Han Sen also thought he was a
formidable opponent.</p>
<p>His techniques did not seem fancy, but were extremely practical.
In addition, he had an outstanding physique. Therefore, no one
would be his match.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s physique was among the top in the unevolved category,
but compared to Jing Jiwu, he was not as good.</p>
<p>Currently, Han Sen’s sacred and mutant geno points were not
maxed out yet, and his Jadeskin had not even reached the first
phase. If he could improve on those two aspects, he should be able
to beat Jing Jiwu.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are you really as strong as the person in the White
Birds Forest?” Shi Zhikang couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>As a student in the archery department, Shi Zhikang knew how
difficult it must be. It was the ultimate goal of any archer.</p>
<p>“More or less,” Han Sen shrugged and said helplessly.</p>
<p>“If you will, we should go take the test here on campus, so that
the senior team members would stop their bulls,” Shi Zhikang said
with anger.</p>
<p>Although the senior team members did not say much at the time,
secretly they commented on Han Sen’s arrogance, which pissed Shi
Zhikang off.</p>
<p>“It is unnecessary to prove anything to strangers. At the time
of the match, the truth will speak for itself,” said Lu Meng
reasonably.</p>
<p>Zhang Yang also nodded, “We should ignore them now and practice
hard. If the school sends us, we will show them Lu Meng is not
impossible in the tournament.”</p>
<p>Shi Zhikang had to give up the idea of taking Han Sen to take
the test.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you have a minute?” A sensual female voice sounded
when they were going back to the dormitory.</p>
