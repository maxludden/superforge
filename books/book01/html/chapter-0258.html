<p>Situ Xiang did not know what to say. She wanted to win more than
anybody. However, the gap between the two teams was too big.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang had no clue herself as to how to beat the strongest
military school. But as a coach, she could not tell her team that
they had no hope.</p>
<p>After watching the first match of the Alliance Central Military
Academy, Situ Xiang had to say that this was probably the best team
the archery tournament had ever seen.</p>
<p>With the monster Jing Jiwu and other players like Qin Cheng, the
team was so strong that it was beyond her imagination.</p>
<p>“If you really want to win, there is only one way.” Situ Xiang
pondered for a while and said to Han Sen.</p>
<p>In fact, Situ Xiang had thought about this match a million
times. But no matter what decision she made, she thought they would
still lose.</p>
<p>The absolute gap in strength was beyond any strategy or tactics.
But even so, Situ Xiang still hoped to win. She had a tentative
plan, but she did not even believe it was possible to execute. It
was deep in her mind, but she did not even have enough confidence
to share that with her team. From a coach, the plan was quite
absurd.</p>
<p>Questioned by Han Sen like this, Situ Xiang had half a mind to
share her plan. Although it was a bit ridiculous, what if they
could actually realize it?</p>
<p>The desire to win burned in Situ Xiang, which motivated her to
speak her mind. But she did not say it immediately, and chose to
test the water first.</p>
<p>“I really want to win. Whatever the method is, please tell me,”
said Han Sen earnestly, full of fighting will.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang was quite touched. She did not expect that Han Sen
who seemed to care little about the school team had such a sense of
honor.</p>
<p>If she knew that he was actually thinking about a trip with his
girlfriend, she would probably be pissed off.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang felt all her team members watching her, full of
hope.</p>
<p>No one wanted to lose, even the old team members, as long as
there was a chance to win.</p>
<p>“Coach, please tell us, how can we win?” Zhang Yang asked Situ
Xiang hurriedly.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang gritted her teeth and said grimly, “When it comes to
the absolute strength, you had no chance at all. Each and every one
of their players is more experienced. Even the collaboration among
them is much better than you guys.”</p>
<p>Situ Xiang paused and continued, “However, that doesn’t mean
everything. Although they had a huge advantage, it does not mean
you have no chance.”</p>
<p>Situ Xiang’s gaze fell upon Han Sen. “Although this chance is
extremely slim, if you’re willing to try, there is a possibility;
whereas if you do not try, you will definitely lose. If you decide
to give it a shot, you will still have a 99% chance of losing. Are
you still willing to do this?”</p>
<p>“Please tell us how to do it.” Han Sen was calm and determined.
Other team members also looked at Situ Xiang eagerly.</p>
<p>“Here… Look at this…” Situ Xiang pulled out the simulation of
the field and started to explain.</p>
<p>Before the match began, the stands were filled with the audience
from all over the Alliance.</p>
<p>People were extremely enthusiastic about this match between Jing
Jiwu and Han Sen.</p>
<p>All sorts of media platforms were also all over this match. The
unpopular archery tournament became such a hit this year.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu was doing all the talking today, as the expert Feng
Jiulun was pulled off by Huaxing Station because of the
complaints.</p>
<p>At the back of the stands, too young man in sunglasses were
whispering to each other.</p>
<p>“Lin Feng, do you think Han Sen could win?” asked Tang Zhenliu
casually.</p>
<p>“In terms of the overall strength of his team, Han Sen has no
chance.” Lin Feng smiled.</p>
<p>“And?” Tang Zhenliu knew Lin Feng had more to say.</p>
<p>Lin Feng thought about it and said, “However, Han Sen’s strength
was assassination. So, he might be able to get rid of a single
person without using the entire team.”</p>
<p>“You mean Han Sen has a chance to eliminate Jing Jiwu?” Tang
Zhenliu regarded Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“Very hard to say. Maybe there is a chance,” whispered Lin
Feng.</p>
<p>Even he could not predict the result of this game and had to
wait and see.</p>
<p>On the stands were almost all the participating teams. Even the
teams that did not have a match this day were here. Qiu Mingmei was
also here with her teammates.</p>
<p>Most of them were here to observe the Alliance Central Military
Academy. In the first round, the team’s opponent was too weak to
make them show their real strength.</p>
<p>Although they did not believe that Blackhawk was the match of
the Alliance Central Military Academy, they thought Han Sen would
be able to force the monster to show what he got.</p>
<p>In the waiting room, Shi Zhikang nervously rubbed his hands
together and murmured to Zhang Yang, “You think coach’s idea will
really work?”</p>
<p>“Why not? If we make every effort, there’s definitely a chance,”
replied Zhang Yang calmly.</p>
<p>“But this is beyond our efforts. It is simply too risky. Once
they could tell what we’re doing, we will definitely lose.” Shi
Zhikang was still nervous.</p>
<p>“It is risky. But this is our only chance. Maybe you would like
to share a better idea?” said Lu Meng.</p>
<p>“If I have a better idea, I will not be so nervous. What do you
think, Sen?” Shi Zhikang smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“This is the best way and our only chance. Let’s just do what
the coach said,” said Han Sen calmly.</p>
<p>The light was on and all the team members looked to Situ
Xiang.</p>
<p>“It’s time.” Situ Xiang took a deep breath and led her team
out.</p>
<p>The moment they appeared in the site, they were greeted by waves
of cheers.</p>
