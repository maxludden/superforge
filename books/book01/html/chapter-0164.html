        <p>Han Sen quietly tracked the gang and saw they had set up a tent
            and made a fire.</p>
        <p>Gu was tied up and Han Sen had not found any good opportunities
            to rescue him.</p>
        <p>As Son of Heaven’s gang were about to finish eating, Han Sen
            thought if Gu was tortured again, the big guy would probably be
            useless even if rescued.</p>
        <p>Having an idea, Han Sen summoned Meowth and ordered it to run
            toward the other side and roar at the gang.</p>
        <p>“A creature!”</p>
        <p>“It’s a sacred-blood creature!”</p>
        <p>“Do not let it run away!”</p>
        <p>“Knife and Baldy stay, we will go hunt that sacred-blood
            creature,” ordered Son of Heaven, leaving two guys watching the
            camp and Gu, while he chased the sacred-blood three-eyed cat with
            the rest.</p>
        <p>Running, Son of Heaven instructed, “Spread out and circle around
            it. We could not go far since it’s dark.”</p>
        <p>Seeing the gang running away, Han Sen summoned the wings and
            shapeshifted into bloody slayer, flying toward the camp in
            darkness.</p>
        <p>“Baldy, incoming!” shouted Knife when Han Sen was 30 feet from
            the camp.</p>
        <p>Baldy quickly summoned a mutant beast soul spear and watched Han
            Sen closely. Knife also summoned his pair of daggers.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was in their face in no more than the blink of an eye.
            Holding the Shura katana, Han Sen whacked it at Baldy.</p>
        <p>This strike from above was swift and powerful, but Baldy raised
            his spear with two hands and tried to block it.</p>
        <p>The Shura katana cut into the spear deeply, and Baldy’s legs
            were forced into the sand by Han Sen’s terrifying strength.</p>
        <p>When Baldy thought that he had warded off the strike, his spear
            broke.</p>
        <p>Baldy wanted to go back, but his legs were still in the sand and
            there was no way to run. Another katana strike cut Baldy in
            half.</p>
        <p>Ding! Ding!</p>
        <p>Two daggers were shot at Han Sen and mercilessly nailed in the
            gaps on the elbow part of his armor. To kill Baldy, Han Sen had no
            time to dodge.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, these two daggers were only mutant beast souls.
            Although they were swift enough, they were still stuck before they
            could cut deeper. Otherwise, Han Sen’s arms would have been
            disabled.</p>
        <p>After killing Baldy, Han Sen turned to deal with Knife, who
            immediately started running at an incredible speed, not leaving any
            chance for Han Sen to approach him.</p>
        <p>Shouting while running, Knife managed to alert Son of Heaven and
            the rest of the gang.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not chase him, but lifted Gu who was tied up and ran
            away with all four hooves of the bloody slayer.</p>
        <p>“Dollar, you son of a bitch! If you are a man, fight me
            one-on-one,” cursed Son of Heaven behind him.</p>
        <p>“I think it is more like one gang on one person,” said Han Sen
            full of disdain, running at full speed.</p>
        <p>The gang thought that lifting a big man like Gu must slow Han
            Sen down and they could eventually catch up. But suddenly, a black
            three-eyed tiger appeared next to Han Sen and he simply lay Gu on
            the tiger’s back. The bloody slayer and the tiger disappeared from
            their sight in an instant.</p>
        <p>“Why would that sacred-blood creature help Dollar?” The gang
            members were confused.</p>
        <p>Son of Heaven finally understood, “Damn, that is not a
            sacred-blood creature. It is a sacred-blood beast soul pet! That
            motherf*#er had fed a sacred-blood pet!”</p>
        <p>Everyone was shocked. A sacred-blood pet must have cost so much
            advanced creature meat to transform.</p>
        <p>After chasing for a while, the gang gave up. In fact, when they
            found out that the tiger was a sacred-blood pet, they had lost
            confidence.</p>
        <p>“How did he make a sacred-blood pet transform? Did he use
            sacred-blood creature meat to feed his pet?” Everyone was shocked
            by the fact that Dollar had a transformed sacred-blood pet, which
            implied incredible power of him.</p>
        <p>Han Sen ran for a while and shapeshifted back after losing the
            gang. He put Gu on the ground and cut loose the ropes.</p>
        <p>“Dollar?” Gu recognized him.</p>
        <p>“Friend, how much do you think your life is worth?” asked Han
            Sen.</p>
        <p>Gu was suddenly taken aback, “You also want my sacred-blood
            sledgehammer?”</p>
        <p>“Not necessarily that beast soul, but I did save you. You do not
            mean to say the risks I took are for nothing, right?” said Han
            Sen.</p>
        <p>Gu did not speak and cast an odd look at Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“And now you have nothing but injuries. Can you leave Devil
            Desert alone safely? If you pay me properly, I can get you back to
            the shelter,” Han Sen continued.</p>
        <p>“Why should I believe in you?” asked Gu.</p>
        <p>“Do you have any other choice?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
        <p>“Except for the sacred-blood sledgehammer, you can pick from all
            the other beast souls I have. But you have to take me to the
            shelter first,” said Gu, wiping blood off his face.</p>
        <p>“Brother Gu, is it?” Han Sen looked at Gu.</p>
        <p>“Call me Gu Ming, or whatever you like. I will not hear Brother
            Gu ever again.” Gu Ming gnashed the teeth in anger.</p>
        <p>Han Sen smiled, “OK. Now you have two options. One is to go out
            on your own, and the other is to pay up front. There is no other
            options. I am not Son of Heaven and will keep my promises. If you
            pay me two mutant beast souls, I could promise to get you back to
            the shelter alive.”</p>
        <p>Gu Ming looked Han Sen up and down and summoned several beast
            souls. “The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I know you and Son of
            Heaven are enemies, so I believe you. Here are all my mutant beast
            souls. Take your pick.”</p>
        <p>Hen Sen glanced at them and pointed twice. “This one is my
            reward for saving you, and that one is the price to take you back
            to the shelter.”</p>
