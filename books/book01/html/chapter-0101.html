        <p>Every year during the contest, there was a lot of special
            programs that covered different matches. Although Contest Center
            was just a new program, it was produced by Huaxing Station, which
            was a prominent TV station. With a celebrity host Fang Mingquan,
            the program had good ratings and was among top 100 in the
            Alliance.</p>
        <p>Top 100 may sound less than impressive, but was in fact an
            amazing achievement. In the entire Alliance, each planet had tens
            of thousands of programs, many of which were from the authority. It
            was quite something to stand out and be among top 100.</p>
        <p>And of course, during the contest, a program focusing on the
            contest itself would naturally have higher ratings.</p>
        <p>On this day, the content of Contest Center caused an uproar in
            the Alliance. Fang Mingquan had introduced and analyzed Dollar’s
            current situation and predicted that this year Dollar would become
            the final champion, which had lead to outspread outrage.</p>
        <p>“Fang Mingquan is a retard. Look at Dollar’s performance, how
            can he win?”</p>
        <p>“We know that you are famous because of Dollar’s video. But
            there is no need to kiss Dollar’s ass like this.”</p>
        <p>“Rubbish. If Dollar is the champion, I will live broadcast
            myself eating shit.”</p>
        <p>“What do you think of Yi Dongmu if you think Dollar could
            win?”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha, Fang Mingquan is so dumb. Dollar will meet Yi Dongmu
            before he gets to top 10. He’d be lucky to survive. To win?
            LMAO.”</p>
        <p>“My Tang Zhenliu would never let him!”</p>
        <p>“My Lin Feng would never let him!”</p>
        <p>“Stupid, stupid, stupid…”</p>
        <p>“Although I also like Dollar, he didn’t do that well in the
            contest so far.”</p>
        <p>“Fang Mingquan, you are too subjective about this. I can’t even
            watch this stuff and I am a fan of Dollar’s.”</p>
        <p>“You call yourself a fan? Go be other people’s fan, please.”</p>
        <p>“Dollar is nothing compared to Yi.”</p>
        <p>“Yi must win.”</p>
        <p>“Dollar little angel, I will always support you.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Contest Center and Fang Mingquan had been made a hit by all the
            criticism. Many peers were satirical about Fang’s grandstanding,
            too. Some even asked him to quit journalism.</p>
        <p>Except for a few hardcore fans of Dollar, all comments on Fang
            was negative. Even many Dollar’s fans thought Fang’s report was
            over the top and didn’t dare to support him.</p>
        <p>“Fang, I’m sorry you are wronged.” In the conference room of
            Huaxing Station, Xu Kangnian grinned from ear to ear.</p>
        <p>Although Contest Center and Fang Mingquan were severely
            criticized, the ratings had risen a lot, sending the show in top
            50.</p>
        <p>A large number of other contestants’ fans flooded into Contest
            Center, especially those who supported Yi Dongmu, this year’s dark
            horse who would encounter Dollar before becoming the Chosen. The
            Skynet community of the show had almost burst.</p>
        <p>Although it was only top 50, for Huaxing Station it was a great
            achievement. There had been less than a handful of shows that could
            accomplish this in the station’s history.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Xu Kangnian was quite pleased with what Fang Mingquan
            had done and Wang Changqing was naturally upset. He didn’t know
            that Fang Mingquan would try to improve the ratings this way.</p>
        <p>“This is just my job. I have Director Xu to thank for my
            achievement.” Fang Mingquan said modestly, flattering Xu at the
            same time.</p>
        <p>Xu Kangnian was even happier and patted Fang Mingquan on the
            shoulder. “Fang, keep talking about Dollar and the stronger you say
            he is the better. If everything goes well, we might have even
            higher ratings and could break our record.”</p>
        <p>“Please rest assured that I will do my best.” Fang Mingquan did
            not think it was grandstanding as he sincerely believed Dollar
            would win. However, others didn’t see it that way. Fortunately, the
            result was good anyway. For a journalist, criticism was not always
            a bad thing.</p>
        <p>Xu Kangnian praised Fang Mingquan some more. After the meeting
            was over and Xu had left, Wang Changqing said coldly, “You are
            ignoring the facts for fame. You might be popular now but the
            reputation of the program would be ruined by you. Which station
            would hire you in the future? Xu’s compliment means nothing. You
            think you can get away with it when he finds out the show was
            discredited?”</p>
        <p>Of course, Fang Mingquan understood that as well. Someone had to
            take the fall when the fad passed. He himself would be that someone
            in this case. Xu was just trying to keep him onboard now to raise
            the ratings. Fang had been in this industry long enough to know
            that.</p>
        <p>Smiling, Fang Mingquan looked at Wang Changqing and asked, “What
            if Dollar really wins?”</p>
        <p>Wang Changqing paused. If Dollar really wins, then Contest
            Center would become famous for real and Fang Mingquan’s name would
            become a household name. Xu Kangnian would treat Fang like the God
            of Wealth.</p>
        <p>“Keep on dreaming,” Wang Changqing scoffed. Anyone could see
            that Dollar did not have what it took to win. He was just average
            and far from top 10, let alone winning.</p>
        <p>“Whether you believe it or not, I firmly believe that Dollar
            will be the champion.” Fang Mingquan got up and went away.</p>
        <p>“Idiot,” Wang Changqing whispered. He was waiting to see how
            miserable Fang would be.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not go on the Skynet, so he was not aware of the
            debate about Contest Center. At the moment, he was practicing with
            Tang Zhenliu in Fang Jingqi’s villa.</p>
        <p>Although Tang Zhenliu would not meet Yi Dongmu before top 10, he
            felt like they were going to meet when they were both top 10
            eventually. So, he was still practicing with Han Sen when he had
            time.</p>
        <p>Only Han Sen knew that Tang would not ecounter Yi Dongmu because
            he would eliminate Yi himself before Yi rose to top 10.</p>
        <p>But a sparring partner like Tang was so precious that Han Sen
            was happy to oblige.</p>
        <p>Having practiced for two days, Tang finally let Han Sen go just
            before the next round of match began.</p>
        <p>Han Sen knew who his opponent was and did not panic. He had made
            up his mind to practice in the match and gain some practical
            experience from his opponent.</p>
        <p>After all, these were the champions of different shelters and it
            was such a rare opportunity to fight them one-on-one. Han Sen had
            not much experience in this kind of matches and was happy that he
            got a chance to gain some.</p>
