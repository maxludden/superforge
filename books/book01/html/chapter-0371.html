        <p>After returning to his dorm, Han Sen dialed Huangfu Pingqing’s
            number and saw her in the holographic image.</p>
        <p>Huangfu Pingqing was wearing a black strap gown. The low-cut
            showed off her deep cleavage. The contrast of black and white made
            her breasts stand out.</p>
        <p>“Little brother, you must be calling me for some favor?” Huangfu
            Pingqing said, smiling.</p>
        <p>“Ahem. Sister, you are so insightful and intelligent to be able
            to tell this… You are definitely the best candidate to inherit Ares
            Martial Hall…” Han Sen said with a dry smile. He never contacted
            Huangfu Pingqing and felt bad that he was only calling because he
            needed something.</p>
        <p>“Just tell me what you want. You’re no good at flattering…”
            Huangfu Pingqing grinned, her face glowing like a blooming
            flower.</p>
        <p>“Sister, then I’ll be straightforward. Can you tell me a thing
            or two about the VIP section of Gladiator?” asked Han Sen.</p>
        <p>After Wang Di told Han Sen about the sacred-blood beast soul
            add-on, Han Sen became very interested, but he did not agree to
            Wang Di’s request immediately.</p>
        <p>The Alliance was different from God’s Sanctuary. The strongest
            opponents Han Sen could ever face in First God’s Sanctuary were
            those who had just become evolvers, and they were not even that
            much of a threat to Han Sen. However, in the Alliance, too many
            people had the ability to kill Han Sen, and he did not dare to
            slack at all, which was why he was asking Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
        <p>“You went to the VIP section?” Huangfu Pingqing suddenly became
            mad. “Didn’t I tell warn you against it repeatedly?”</p>
        <p>“Not me, but one of my schoolmates.” Han Sen told Huangfu
            Pingqing everything about Wang Di. If it was possible, Han Sen
            would love to help him.</p>
        <p>Huangfu Pingqing heard Han Sen out with her brows knitted,
            pondered and said, “Consider this person dead already. Don’t get in
            the middle of this.”</p>
        <p>“How so? If he wins the battle, his debt would go away, right?”
            Han Sen continued to ask.</p>
        <p>“You think those perverts would let him win?” Huangfu Pingqing
            curled her lips and said. “All I could tell you is that whoever
            goes there is a toro waiting to be slaughtered. Less than 1% could
            survive.”</p>
        <p>“If I’m willing to spend some money, will it be possible to get
            him out?” Han Sen thought about it and asked. He’d rather not see
            Wang Di die.</p>
        <p>“You think a snake is going to give up on its prey?” Huangfu
            Pingqing said grimly. “This is not your business. We can do nothing
            about.”</p>
        <p>“What if I fight on behalf of him?” Han Sen asked tentatively.
            He did not want to let go of the sacred-blood beast soul add-on,
            which was almost impossible to find on the market and would be a
            great help and hunting super creatures.</p>
        <p>“You know him very well?” Huangfu Pingqing gazed at Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Not really.” Han Sen told Huangfu Pingqing about Wang Di’s
            proposal to hire Han Sen with the beast souls.</p>
        <p>“You didn’t agree yet, right?” Huangfu Pingqing asked with her
            brows knitted.</p>
        <p>“Not yet. But I really want that beast soul add-on. Is there no
            way around this?” Huangfu Pingqing asked.</p>
        <p>Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes at Han Sen and said, “If I were
            you, I would give up such a stupid idea. If you go there, it is
            impossible that he would survive. To be honest with you, the people
            Wang Di will be facing there are actually evolvers. It is the same
            if you go on his behalf. Do you think you stand any chance?”</p>
        <p>“This is fraud,” said Han Sen, frowning.</p>
        <p>“It is. And what can you do about it? Those people are so
            powerful that neither of us could afford to mess with them. Just
            give up the idea,” said Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
        <p>“If I were to go, what kind of evolver with my opponent be?” Han
            Sen pondered and asked.</p>
        <p>“You are not serious, right? You think you can beat an evolver?
            Any evolver would be too strong for an unevolved person, especially
            in a life-and-death battle like this. Your opponent would not hold
            back at all, because no one would risk his own life.” Huangfu
            Pingqing stared at Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“If the opponent is someone who has just evolved, maybe I could
            win,” He said calmly.</p>
        <p>Huangfu Pingqing gazed at Han Sen for a long before she said, “I
            will send you a video clip. If you think you have what it takes to
            kill this person, then you can go.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen received the video shortly. He clicked play and saw two
            guys fighting in a ring. One guy was as strong as a tower. He was
            at least 8 feet tall. The extremely muscular body made him look
            like Ironman himself.</p>
        <p>The beast soul weapon used by his opponent only left a shallow
            mark on his skin. The muscular man then lifted his opponent up and
            easily ripped the poor guy apart like tearing apart a chicken.
            Blood rained like crazy.</p>
        <p>Audience outside the ring were cheering excitedly, shouting and
            hitting the fence.</p>
        <p>Then the video was followed by another one. The protagonist was
            still the extremely muscular man. His opponent was beheaded
            immediately this time.</p>
        <p>All the video clips were more or less the same thing. All the
            opponents of this man were torn into pieces by him bare-handedly.
            The strongest person only lasted half an hour in front of this man
            before meeting his fate.</p>
        <p>“Who is this person?” Han Sen turned off the video and asked
            Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
        <p>“It is not important who he is. The key is that if you entered
            the life-and-death battle, he is very likely to be your opponent,”
            said Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
        <p>In fact, Huangfu Pingqing was exaggerating a little bit. The
            perverts enjoyed watching a bloody and slow kill instead of a
            seckill, which would be way less fun. Therefore, when they sought
            an opponent for the unevolved, they would prefer to choose an
            evolver without all his geno points maxed out. This way, the
            unevolved would still have some chance to struggle. However, the
            man in the video that Huangfu Pingqing showed Han Sen was a top
            evolver, famous for his cruelty, hence popular among the
            perverts.</p>
        <p>The man was not for every unevolved person. The reason Huangfu
            Pingqing said that was to dissuade Han Sen from risking his
            life.</p>
        <p>“Can you make sure that he will be my opponent if I enter the
            battle?” Han Sen asked seriously.</p>
        <p>“Of course,” said Huangfu Pingqing resolutely. She did not want
            Han Sen to take any chance.</p>
        <p>“Okay then. I have decided that I will enter the battle on
            behalf of Wang Di.” Han Sen’s calm words made Huangfu Pingqing feel
            dumbstruck and speechless.</p>
