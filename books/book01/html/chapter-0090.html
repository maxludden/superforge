        <p>On the next day, Han Sen brought porns to the soldier who had
            asked him for them. The soldier was so happy that he wanted to
            become sworn brothers with Han Sen and said Han Sen would be
            responsible for his happiness from now on.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was covered in sweat. Fortunately, Yang Manli came fast
            enough so that Han Sen got rid of the soldier successfully.</p>
        <p>Yang Manli spent half an hour to explain some archery knowledge
            and gave Han Sen a few tasks to finish on his own.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had learned basic archery knowledge at school and what
            Yang taught him was more practical, which benefited him a lot. Yang
            was indeed an expert.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of tasks for him to complete, which included
            the gravity trainer. Han Sen wanted to use the gravity trainer
            himself. This time he used the protection mechanism to adjust the
            parameters, not to reduce the gravity, but to increase the gravity
            a notch so that it suited his real fitness level better.</p>
        <p>The gym did not seem to be the place where ordinary soldiers
            trained. Han Sen had never seen other soldiers here than the ones
            he talked to.</p>
        <p>During lunch break, Han Sen was chatting with the soldiers he
            knew. The soldier who asked Han Sen for porns regarded Han Sen and
            asked, “Sen, in addition to bow and arrows, what other weapons do
            you use?”</p>
        <p>“Dagger.” Han Sen showed him the Z-steel dagger.</p>
        <p>Han Sen only knew the nicknames of these soldiers. This guy’s
            name was “Gambler.” Han Sen learned from others that he was greedy
            and lewd.</p>
        <p>Gambler took over Han Sen’s dagger and played with it. The
            dagger seemed like a living thing in his hand, making dazzling
            moves like a snake.</p>
        <p>“Watch this.” Gambler held the dagger an inch away from Han
            Sen’s eyes. With a simple wave of his hand, the dagger disappeared
            in front of Han Sen and Gambler’s hand was empty.</p>
        <p>“Shit! Your nickname should be Magician!” Han Sen looked
            everywhere and didn’t see the dagger.</p>
        <p>Gambler laughed and shook his hands in front of Han Sen. He
            curled his fingers and the dagger returned to his hands
            magically.</p>
        <p>“How did you do that?” Han Sen widened his eyes.</p>
        <p>“Pretty cool, huh?” Gambler asked proudly.</p>
        <p>“Yep.” Han Sen quickly nodded.</p>
        <p>“Dazzling, no?” Gambler played with the dagger.</p>
        <p>“For sure.” Han Sen nodded again.</p>
        <p>“Want to learn?” Gambler looked at Han Sen with a faint
            smile.</p>
        <p>“I do. Do you want to teach me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
        <p>“If you can bring me all my girls’ new movies, I will teach
            you.” Gambler said with a smile.</p>
        <p>“No problem.” Han Sen agreed, knowing the girls Gambler referred
            to were certain porn stars.</p>
        <p>Although it cost some money to buy new movies, Han Sen really
            wanted to learn these tricks.</p>
        <p>“Come, we will find a place so that I can show you.” Gambler
            took Han Sen aside and told him the key to it.</p>
        <p>Han Sen then found out that it was not really magic but finger
            tricks. Although it was taking advantage of the blind spots, the
            most important part was one’s control of the muscles on the
            arm.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was the entire arm instead of just the hand.</p>
        <p>Gambler told him that this trick was called “heaven in sleeves,”
            also known as “Sleeveblade.” It was passed down in his family as
            the foundation of their family business. The dirk Gambler used was
            specially made. Thin and sharp, it had a crescent-like double-edged
            blade but no hilt.</p>
        <p>Gambler was playing with one dirk in each hand, and it looked
            like there were two butterflies dancing around his hands, which was
            amazing to watch.</p>
        <p>“How long will it take for me to become a master like you?” Han
            Sen looked at Gambler enviously.</p>
        <p>Gambler smiled, “I started at the age of three, and became
            better at seven. I’m now intermediate and still far from being a
            master.”</p>
        <p>He gave the dagger back to Han Sen and said, “Do not
            underestimate this trick. Although it is just lays the foundation,
            but it is fundamental and will benefit you for the rest of your
            life.”</p>
        <p>“Gambler, what does your family do?” Han Sen could not help but
            ask.</p>
        <p>“Aha, you will never be in our business and I do not intend to
            let you. I’m just showing you a trick. You could practice it if you
            think it is fun. Never mind other issues.” Gambler walked away and
            turned back to ask Han Sen, “Have you ever played games on the
            Skynet?”</p>
        <p>“Rarely.” Han Sen had spent all his time trying to survive, and
            had no time for games.</p>
        <p>“Go play ‘Hand of God.’ It will help you learn this trick. If
            you can level up in that game, you will be getting somewhere with
            this trick.” Gambler pointed to the holographic training
            machine.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was very interested in Sleeveblade, so he went to check
            out Hand of God on the holographic training machine. Soon he
            understood why Gambler asked him to play this game.</p>
        <p>This was a holographic game. Its idea was like Whack-a-Mole, but
            instead of using fingers alone, the spots to touch could appear
            everywhere around one’s arms. One must use all muscles rationally
            to hit all the spots to pass a level. It was highly demanding for
            one’s dexterity and accuracy.</p>
        <p>In addition to the beginner level, the game was divided into
            three levels: evolver, surpass and demigod.</p>
        <p>The intention of the classification was obviously to correspond
            with the three phases of God’s Sanctuary, and to guide players to
            choose the right level.</p>
        <p>Han Sen first chose the beginner level. Actually, when Gambler
            said “level up,” he meant to clear the beginner level. As for which
            level Gambler himself was in, Han Sen had no way of knowing.</p>
        <p>Soon, Han Sen was hooked. He was not that smooth in the
            beginning, but was soon addicted to the satisfaction gained from
            hitting rapidly as he got familiar with the game.</p>
        <p>“Faster, faster, faster…” Once started, the game would push one
            to pursue the exhilaration in speeding up.</p>
        <p>But Han Sen did not have much time to play this game. After a
            few rounds in the martial arts contest, Han Sen reached the final
            match as expected.</p>
        <p>Not sure it was good luck or bad luck, Han Sen didn’t encounter
            either Fist Guy or Son of Heaven. Son of Heaven had eliminated Fist
            Guy, and Qin Xuan had eliminated Son of Heaven. The final match was
            between Qin Xuan and Han Sen.</p>
        <p>In fact, Han Sen wanted to fight Son of Heaven more, so that he
            would have the opportunity to kill Son of Heaven on the stage.
            Usually the young master was surrounded by many strong men and
            there was almost no chance for Han Sen to approach him.</p>
