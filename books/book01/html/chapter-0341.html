        <p>Mr. Xu frowned upon Han Sen’s words. Although the sacred-blood
            beast souls in First God’s Sanctuary were rare, the normal value of
            a sacred-blood beast soul from the First and one from the Second
            were 3 to 1.</p>
        <p>Although the sacred-blood armor and sacred-blood mount in
            Sapphire Shelter were not the best, he would not necessarily trade
            them for even six sacred-blood beast souls in First God’s
            Sanctuary. However, Han Sen was trying to exchange for both using
            just three, which made Mr. Xu sneer.</p>
        <p>“Brother, can you show us the beast souls you have?” Yang Zikun
            said with a smile.</p>
        <p>Han Sen summoned his three-blade harpoon, brandished it briefly
            and said, “I think you should recognize this three-blade harpoon.
            Huangfu Pingqing once showed it at an auction. It is rather sharp
            among sacred-blood weapons.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu was dazed. He had heard of this harpoon. In fact, they
            did a lot of business with Ares Martial Hall. And he had thought
            about acquiring this harpoon before. In terms of sharpness, the
            three-blade harpoon was more than just “rather sharp,” but
            definitely one of the sharpest weapon in First God’s Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu did not expect Han Sen would produce this weapon first.
            It was a top-notch sacred-blood beast soul. Normally speaking, one
            would not let go of it.</p>
        <p>“Brother, are you really going to sell this?” Yang Zikun asked
            Han Sen in surprise.</p>
        <p>“Sure.” Han Sen smiled. This three-blade harpoon did not mean as
            much to him at this point. He could not kill a super creature with
            this harpoon. And since the harpoon was not a sword, he could not
            attach the devil sword to it.</p>
        <p>Han Sen still had the pair of skeleton’s daggers, which were as
            sharp as the three-blade harpoon. Although they were not as
            valuable as the beast soul, to Han Sen, they functioned equally
            well. Therefore, Han Sen wanted to sell his harpoon.</p>
        <p>For the second piece of beast soul, Han Sen summoned the tornado
            wolf.</p>
        <p>“A mount?” Asked Yang Zikun, gazing at the tornado wolf.</p>
        <p>Yang Zikun had never seen such a mount before and did not know
            what it could do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu frowned slightly. Although the three-blade harpoon was
            great, a sacred-blood mount from Second God’s Sanctuary was
            definitely worth at least three sacred-blood mount in the
            First.</p>
        <p>Han Sen smiled and explained, “It is a mount called tornado
            wolf. It is nothing but fast. You should have heard about blast
            horse?”</p>
        <p>“Of course, blast horse is the fastest mount in First God’s
            Sanctuary,” Yang Zikun nodded and said.</p>
        <p>“This tornado wolf is slightly faster than blast horse. What do
            you think of it now?” said Han Sen casually.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu stared at the tornado wolf and asked, “Are you serious?
            Is it really faster than blast horse?”</p>
        <p>“If you don’t believe me, you can try it out. If it is not
            faster than blast horse, I will give it to you for free,” said Han
            Sen with a smile.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of videos of blast horse on the Skynet. Han Sen
            had no doubt that the tornado wolf was faster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu changed his look. If this tornado wolf was really faster
            than blast horse, its value was hard to say.</p>
        <p>Although a sacred-blood mount from the First God’s Sanctuary was
            not as valuable as a sacred-blood one from the Second, it still
            very much depended on what sort of mount it was. If the tornado
            wolf was the fastest mount in First God’s Sanctuary, then it was
            invaluable.</p>
        <p>“Fantastic,” Yang Zikun said. It seemed that he liked the
            tornado wolf quite a lot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu now had high hopes for Han Sen’s third beast soul.
            Although the two beast souls Han Sen had shown them were both
            top-notch, he still needed the third beast soul to wow him before
            he would consider the deal. As he was still thinking, Han Sen had
            summoned the third beast soul. Han Sen suddenly shapeshifted into a
            giant bear.</p>
        <p>“A shapeshifting beast soul!” Yang Zikun and Mr. Xu were
            overjoyed.</p>
        <p>Sacred-blood shapeshifting beast souls were very rare, and the
            one Han Sen was showing could even use different martial arts and
            weapons. A beast soul like this would be bid to the sky.</p>
        <p>Han Sen took back the beast soul and said to Yang Zikun, “The
            sacred-blood shapeshifting beast soul is named ghost-eyed bear. It
            could greatly enhance one’s strength and speed. If I were to trade
            these three beast souls for the two sacred-blood beast souls you
            have in Second God’s Sanctuary, what would you think?”</p>
        <p>“Let’s do it,” Yang Zikun said without hesitation. Although he
            would not profit much from the deal, it was a great deal
            nonetheless. Han Sen had produced three excellent beast souls,
            which were the top in their own type.</p>
        <p>In addition, Yang Zikun liked the three sacred-blood beast souls
            very much, especially the sacred-blood ghost-eyed bear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu had changed his point of view on Han Sen. Three
            sacred-blood beast souls like this were so hard to come by that
            they were totally enough to match the two sacred-blood beast souls
            they have in Second God’s Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Yang Zikun asked Mr. Xu to prepare the contract. After they both
            signed, Mr. Xu arranged for a guy to transfer the two sacred-blood
            beast souls to Luo Sulan.</p>
        <p>Han Sen called his mother and asked her to receive the two beast
            souls.</p>
        <p>With the sacred-blood armor and sacred-blood mount, even if Luo
            Sulan was in danger, she would be able to keep herself alive.</p>
        <p>Han Sen and Yang Zikun used the teleport device in the private
            club to enter Steel Armor Shelter and completed the deal.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had wanted to do this for a long time, but he hadn’t
            found the right opportunity or people whom he trusted. Eventually,
            he was able to accomplish the deal.</p>
        <p>After completing the deal, both parties were satisfied about the
            transaction.</p>
        <p>Originally, Yang Zikun only wished to gain one or two
            sacred-blood beast souls. In the end, he was able to obtain three
            top-notch beast souls, which were all practical as well.</p>
        <p>“Brother, you have so many excellent beast souls. Can you show
            us a few more?” Yang Zikun looked at Han Sen excitedly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Xu also looked at Han Sen curiously. A person that had so
            many amazing beast souls triggered his curiosity. Since Han Sen was
            selling incredible beast souls, what beast souls would he keep for
            himself?</p>
