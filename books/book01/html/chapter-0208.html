        <p>When night falls, by the glistening pond and under a willow
            tree, a young couple were standing together.</p>
        <p>“Close your eyes.”</p>
        <p>“Why should I do that?”</p>
        <p>“Please.”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“If you don’t close your eyes, I’ll leave.”</p>
        <p>“You can’t eat your own words.”</p>
        <p>“So close your eyes.”</p>
        <p>“Ok.”</p>
        <p>“No peeking.”</p>
        <p>“Alright alright.”</p>
        <p>Seeing Han Sen had closed his eyes, Ji Yanran whose cheeks were
            red tiptoed and leaned her face towards Han Sen’s.</p>
        <p>However, before her pink lips touched his face, she saw that he
            opened his eyes and watched her with a faint smile. Feeling
            ashamed, Ji Yanran wanted to stop and turn away.</p>
        <p>Yet Han Sen hands had held her small waist and she suddenly fell
            in his arms. His mouth covered hers.</p>
        <p>“Hmm…”</p>
        <p>When Han Sen was enjoying making out with his beautiful
            girlfriend, his comlink suddenly rang.</p>
        <p>Han Sen wanted to turn it off but his girlfriend pressed answer.
            Suddenly, a sexy woman in white lingerie with her boobs almost
            popping out showed up in the holographic image.</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry, Sen. It seems that I am interrupting you guys. I
            will hang up,” the sexy woman said with her face gloomy and hung
            up.</p>
        <p>“You asshole…” Ji Yanran stepped on Han Sen’s foot madly and
            turned away.</p>
        <p>" I can explain." Han Sen chased after her.</p>
        <p>“I don’t want to listen.” Ji Yanran did not really want to run.
            she turned her head away childishly.</p>
        <p>Having to explain to her while walking, Han Sen blamed Huangfu
            Pingqing secretly. He believed that she was doing it on
            purpose.</p>
        <p>In her dorm, Huangfu Pingqing was in a great mood and humming a
            song. Of course she meant it. She had been informed that Ji Yanran
            and Han Sen went to the lakeside, and that was why she had
            calculated the time and changed into the right outfit before she
            dialed Han Sen’s number.</p>
        <p>“You won’t be able to run from me.” Huangfu Pingqing said to
            herself while enjoying her bath.</p>
        <p>Blackhawk’s opponent in the next round was also a strong team.
            Although Han Sen and Ouyang Xiaosan had each won a round, the
            overall level of Blackhawk was too low to win the competition.</p>
        <p>Han Sen could do nothing about that. He had done everything he
            could have and many viewers felt injustice and protested the change
            of rules.</p>
        <p>However, there was nothing anyone can do about this.</p>
        <p>Because Blackhawk and St. Germain had all been eliminated and
            the Alliance Central Military Academy was not in the competition,
            there was little to watch. After Blackhawk was out, the popularity
            of the competition was plummeting, which made the sponsor feel
            terrible.</p>
        <p>Except for Blackhawk’s games, other matches were all protested
            against and had very low ratings.</p>
        <p>However, the video of Han Sen and St. Germain’s game had been
            played a lot. The ID Black Fist Emperor became really popular in
            the circle of black and white boxing.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not care for that. Black and white boxing was a
            great way to exercise the usage of yin and yang forces and the
            prejudgment of the opponent’s intention. However, he did not intend
            to commit himself to it. He was only in the competition because of
            the invitation of his schoolmates and he never wanted to become a
            professional player.</p>
        <p>Han Sen went to the auction that Huangfu Pingqing mentioned, and
            the two sacred-blood beast soul both ended up with skyrocketing
            prices. He had nothing to bid with in the auction.</p>
        <p>The sacred-blood flying beast soul was bought by Lin Beifeng
            with 178 million dollars, whereas the three-blade harpoon was even
            more popular and was won by Son of Heaven in the end with 230
            million dollars, which made Han Sen feel quite unbelievable.</p>
        <p>He had wanted to sell his SKTS and put in all his savings, but
            had to let that thought go, because he simply did not have
            enough.</p>
        <p>The crazy prices made him want to sell his own sacred-blood
            beast souls at one point. He could become rich immediately.</p>
        <p>Even if he could sell his sacred-blood beast soul each at just
            100 million, he would have several hundred million dollars by
            now.</p>
        <p>However, this kind of money was not enough for someone rich to
            buy an interstellar spaceship, so it really was nothing.</p>
        <p>After the auction, Han Sen was thinking where he should go
            hunting. The moment he walked out of Steel Armor Shelter, the sky
            suddenly became dark.</p>
        <p>“It is noon now. How come it suddenly became dark? Is it going
            to rain?” Han Sen felt weird because the sky was very clear just
            now.</p>
        <p>When he looked up, Han Sen almost jumped. There was not a piece
            of cloud in the sky, but a giant island floating above the Steel
            Armor Shelter like a Mountain upside down, blocking the Sun and
            covering the shelter and its surrounding areas in the shadow.</p>
        <p>“Mystery Island, it is a Mystery Island!” exclaimed someone.</p>
        <p>Han Sen also recognized that it was a Mystery Island. He had
            only seen it online before. It was his first time to see a Mystery
            Island in the real life.</p>
        <p>The Mystery Island was a floating island that occasionally
            appeared in the sky. Each Mystery Island had a sacred-blood
            creature guarding it, and according to people’s experience, if
            someone killed a sacred-blood creature on the island, one would get
            its sacred-blood beast soul for sure.</p>
        <p>Therefore, seeing the island meant chance of getting a
            sacred-blood beast soul. However, it was not easy to fly that high
            and land on the Mystery Island.</p>
        <p>Neither primitive nor mutant flying beast souls could carry one
            that high. Only sacred-blood beast souls could, which was the
            threshold to land on the island.</p>
        <p>Han Sen became thrilled. Steel Armor Shelter did not have many
            flying Beast souls to offer. And people here had not even heard of
            any sacred-blood wings, except for his purple-winged dragon.</p>
        <p>The other pair of wings known to people in addition to his was
            just sold by Huangfu Pingqing and was now in Lin Beifeng’s
            hand.</p>
        <p>Han Sen felt amused, “Huangfu Pingqing must be regretting right
            now. Had she waited a little longer, the sacred-blood wings would
            be even more expensive than the three-blade harpoon. Son of Heaven
            is definitely also regretting not having bought the sacred-blood
            wings.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen found a secluded spot and summoned the black beetle
            armor which had recovered from the previous damages and his
            purple-winged dragon beast soul. He could not wait to fly to the
            Mystery Island.</p>
        <p>When he was up in the air, he saw from afar that from the other
            direction someone else was also flying toward the Mystery
            Island.</p>
        <p>“Lin Beifeng is fast enough,” Han Sen thought and approached
            that person, but when he was closer he saw that it was not Lin
            Beifeng, but Son of Heaven.</p>
