<p>Hearing Jing Jiya’s words, Han Sen smiled and patted him on the
shoulder. “Jing Jiya, if you want to threaten someone, you’ll have
to be smart. When you speak, try to act like a tough guy so that I
might be scared.”</p>
<p>Jing Jiya’s face became grim. He said, “Brother, I am not
joking.”</p>
<p>Leaning against the back of his chair, Han Sen stretched and
said slowly, “Since you have investigated my family, you should
know who I am. Do you dare to touch them? Now tell me again you’re
not joking.”</p>
<p>Jing Jiya smiled and said, “Brother, you’re right. I do not dare
to touch your family, but your friends might not be as lucky. I
don’t dare to do anything to Wang Mengmeng or Lu Meng either, but
Shi Zhikang and Zhang Yang were under no one’s protection.”</p>
<p>“I would be interested to know how you plan to hurt them in
Blackhawk,” said Han Sen.</p>
<p>Jing Jiya was still smiling. “It will not be easy for me to
injure them on campus, and it’s gonna be a waste of time to hurt
their family. But do you think I could seduce their girlfriends?
You think I’m going to succeed?”</p>
<p>“Jing Jiya, there are things that you should never do,” replied
Han Sen solemnly. Whether Jing Jiya could succeed or not, he will
not let it happen.</p>
<p>“If you’re angry, you can take it out on me during our duel
anytime,” said Jing Jiya with politely.</p>
<p>“As you wish then.” Although Han Sen did not want to waste his
time, he no longer wanted to tolerate the kid’s provocation. He
would take care of what should be taken care of.</p>
<p>Jing Jiya appeared to be exhilarated. “I will be waiting for
you. Please keep your words, otherwise…”</p>
<p>Jing Jiya did not finish his sentence, but even an idiot could
understand him. Han Sen smiled and said, “Jing Jiwu did not teach
his brother well, so I will be a good friend and do that for
him.”</p>
<p>Jing Jiya was a bit upset hearing that, but he did not talk
back. Since Han Sen had agreed to his challenge, all he needed to
do was beating Han Sen. It was pointless to win an argument.</p>
<p>Jing Jiya had always thought that only by defeating Han Sen
could he avenge his brother.</p>
<p>Seeing Jing Jiya left, Han Sen immediately moved on to consider
his trip to Glory Shelter. Although he might still be a bit weak,
maybe he could give it a shot.</p>
<p>Flame lieutenant, devil sword and the second phase of Heresy
Mantra, those might be all that it took for him to kill a super
creature. Most importantly, the black turtle was not very fast, so
he could always run away.</p>
<p>“It seems I should make the trip. Tomorrow after I kick the
kid’s ass, I’ll leave for Glory Shelter.” Han Sen did not want to
miss the opportunity. After all, super creatures were so rare that
he did not know when he would see the next one if he missed this
turtle.</p>
<p>After Jing Jiya left, he spread the news that he was about to
challenge Han Sen the next day on the archery range. In order to
clear his brother’s name, he would like for everyone to know how he
beat Han Sen.</p>
<p>Jing Jiya had even thought of his line after beating Han Sen,
“Although you are quite good, you’re still nothing compared to me,
and even less than nothing compared to my older brother. Your one
win was just based on pure luck.”</p>
<p>Soon the entire Blackhawk knew about the duel. Almost everyone
hearing the news became excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen was the legend of Blackhawk, and Jing Jiya was another
monster after his older brother, so their duel attracted a lot of
attention.</p>
<p>Even many professors decided to have a look after hearing about
it.</p>
<p>The next morning, before Han Sen and Jing Jiya got there, the
stands around the archery range was packed with audience.</p>
<p>“Who do you think will win?”</p>
<p>“The genius of course. Even Jing Jiwu was not his match, let
alone Jing Jiya.” The senior students who had witnessed how strong
Han Sen was mostly supported him.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. You have all seen Jing Jiya’s record, which
is probably even better than Jing Jiwu when he was at school. Han
Sen only beat Jing Jiwu because of good luck and he had not done
much in recent two years. I’m afraid he will lose to Jing
Jiya…”</p>
<p>Among freshmen, more people supported Jing Jiya, especially the
girls. Jing Jiya’s good looks won him a lot of popularity.</p>
<p>“Ms. Chen, you’re also here to see the duel?” Situ Xiang looked
at Chen Ling in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, Han Sen once represented the Martial Arts Society and I
have come to support him,” said Chen Ling with a smile.</p>
<p>“Come and join me. The view is better here.” Situ Xiang brought
Chen Ling to the coach’s bench.</p>
<p>“Coach, who do you think he has a better chance, Han Sen or Jing
Jiya?” Chen Ling asked.</p>
<p>“It is very hard to say. So many things had happened to Han Sen
in the recent two years, and I can say that Jing Jiya has even
surpassed his brother,” replied Situ Xiang with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Chen Ling knew what the coach was saying, so she nodded and did
not speak again.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s roommates also came to cheer him up, and Wang Mengmeng
came with them as well. However, the stands were so full they had
to watch on their feet.</p>
<p>“Can Han Sen win? That Jing Jiya kid is quite something,” said
Shi Zhikang with his brows knitted. He had seen Jing Jiya’s match
and the kid was indeed quite talented.</p>
<p>Jing Jiya was also in the Archery Department, so Shi Zhikang had
competed with him a few times. Shi Zhikang sensed even more stress
facing Jing Jiya than when he met Jing Jiwu.</p>
<p>Zhang Yang and Lu Meng did not speak. In fact, they both had
fought Jing Jiya and suffered terrible losses. They felt the same
as Shi Zhikang did: Jing Jiya was even more formidable than Jing
Jiwu.</p>
<p>“Brother Han will definitely win.” Wang Mengmeng was Han Sen’s
diehard fan and believed in him as always.</p>
