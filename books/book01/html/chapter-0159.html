        <h2>A Fact</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 159</h3>

        <p>More people wanted to know where to buy a warframe like Silver
            Killer. They had searched the Skynet for all products available,
            but found nothing like it.</p>
        <p>Many people had guessed that it was custom-made, but still have
            no idea which company had produced it, as there was no imprint on
            Silver Killer.</p>
        <p>At the same time, in a military factory, Liu Changming said to
            Professor Tang, “Come and look at this.” Tang Mingxiu was an
            authoritative figure in the warframe industry and specialized in
            biological warframe. The super biological warframes that they were
            preparing to launch was a product developed by Tang’s team.</p>
        <p>After Tang Mingxiu sat down, Liu Changming played a video
            showing Han Sen and Silver Killer’s game—the version edited by Fang
            Mingquan.</p>
        <p>Tang Mingxiu was slightly surprised and said, “This is the T9
            prototype from our lab. Its driver must be an evolver player?”</p>
        <p>“Good eye, Professor Tang! It is the T9 prototype, but its
            driver is a freshman at Blackhawk, 17 years old and unevolved,” Liu
            Changming said with a smile.</p>
        <p>“A military school freshman?” Tang Mingxiu was stunned, and
            carefully looked at the video again. He could not believe an
            unevolved person can reach this level.</p>
        <p>"Professor Tang, the video you see right now is a single
            warframe combat, which had aroused great attention among all major
            military schools. Now almost all the military school students know
            about Silver Killer, which is our T9 prototype. "Liu Changming said
            with a smile.</p>
        <p>“You want to take advantage of this opportunity to launch T10?”
            Tang Mingxiu immediately understood what Liu Changming was going
            for.</p>
        <p>“I think this student is fit to be T10’s spokesperson to help us
            promote T10, and T10’s appearance needs some changes to imitate T9.
            Professor Tang, what do you think of this idea?” Liu Changming
            explained his proposal.</p>
        <p>“I’m okay with it, but he is just a military school student. Can
            he really be the spokesperson of T10?” Tang Mingxi wondered.</p>
        <p>Liu Changming laughed. “I have done a detailed investigation of
            him, and it chances that he is a member of the special squad.”</p>
        <p>“He is a special squad member?” Tang Mingxiu was surprised
            again, because it was very rare that someone Han Sen’s age could
            join the special squad.</p>
        <p>“Yes. You remember Qin Xuan from House Qin? She was the one who
            recommended Han Sen.” Liu Changming smiled.</p>
        <p>“That girl! She is still in First God’s Sanctuary?” Tang Mingxiu
            nodded. He had a great impression of Qin Xuan.</p>
        <p>“She should evolve and go to Second God’s Sanctuary very soon,”
            Liu Changming replied.</p>
        <p>Tang Mingxiu nodded and said, “Since he is recommended by that
            girl, he should be able to endorse T10.”</p>
        <p>“Since you agree with me on this, then I will go ahead and
            execute the plan.” Liu Changming was quite excited.</p>
        <p>Although T10 is a latest type of biological warframe, it fell
            short in performance and other aspects compared to T9. After all,
            T9 was a military prototype, whereas T10 was a model for civil
            use.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not know there was a good thing waiting to happen.
            At this moment, he was humming a little song on the way to a
            date.</p>
        <p>After celebrating the entire night with his roommates, Han Sen
            texted Ji Yanran and got a reply from her unexpectedly. Ji asked
            him to meet at the cafeteria near their dorms, the one that had the
            fruit juice that they both enjoyed.</p>
        <p>Ready to be kissed by this beauty, Han Sen felt full of energy
            and power walked to the cafeteria.</p>
        <p>It was after two o’clock in the morning. There was only a curvy
            figure in the entire cafeteria.</p>
        <p>Han Sen sat down opposite Ji Yannan and said with a smile, “Well
            done. You are keeping your promise this time.”</p>
        <p>She blushed a little and remained quiet. Biting her pink lip,
            she regarded Han Sen with her charming eyes for as long as ten
            minutes.</p>
        <p>As thick-skinned as Han Sen, he was shy after being looked at
            for so long. He said, “I know I am very handsome, but if you keep
            gazing at me like this, I might get the wrong idea.”</p>
        <p>“What wrong idea?” Ji Yanran finally spoke.</p>
        <p>“Wrong idea that you want to make a pass at me.” Han Sen
            blinked, looking abashed.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran blushed more and stared at Han Sen. “You wish!”</p>
        <p>“I’m afraid you would wish that.” Han Sen looked scared.</p>
        <p>Ji Yannan snapped, “Stop the nonsense, or I will leave.”</p>
        <p>“Do not go. You still owe me the kiss.” Han Sen shamelessly
            stuck his face in front of Ji Yanran and pouted. “Here, on the
            lips.”</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran was very shy and flicked him on the forehead. “If you
            keep doing that, I will leave for real.”</p>
        <p>“I’m just trying to claim what is mine,” Hansen rubbed his
            forehead and said helplessly.</p>
        <p>“I can kiss you… but you have to answer a few questions first.”
            Ji Yanran looked at Han Sen and asked. She had been wondering about
            some things.</p>
        <p>“If I can answer them, I will. But if I can’t, you cannot refuse
            to kiss me.” Han Sen was determined.</p>
        <p>“I know.” She had never blushed so much in her life.</p>
        <p>“On the spaceship, did you or did you not cheat in the game?” Ji
            Yanran stayed calm and asked.</p>
        <p>“I’ve told you a lot of times. I have not cheated.” Hansen
            spread out his hands.</p>
        <p>“Did you have an account on the Battlenet?” Ji asked again.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” replied Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“What is your ID?” Ji Yanran hesitated and asked anxiously.</p>
        <p>“My-girlfriend-is-Ji-Yanran,” Han Sen answered directly.</p>
        <p>Ji Yanran’s face was burning. She cried, “How can you use such
            an ID?”</p>
        <p>“I was just stating a fact. You are my girlfriend,” Han Sen
            looked at Ji Yanran, blinked and said.</p>
