<h2>Duel</h2>
<h3>Chapter 261</h3>

<p>“Amazing Blackhawk… Amazing Han Sen… This is definitely an
epoch-making game. The Alliance Central Military Academy was never
pushed this far before. Blackhawk is only one step from victory,
but that one step is so difficult, because in front of them is the
best player in the Military Academy League, Jing Jiwu,” said Wen
Xiuxiu, thrilled.</p>
<p>The viewers also became excited. At an absolute advantage,
Blackhawk still lost three players to Jing Jiwu, who was indeed a
monster.</p>
<p>However, at this point, Jing Jiwu was the only one that had
survived on his team.</p>
<p>On Blackhawk’s side, the remaining were only Han Sen and Lu
Meng. They had every intention to eliminate Jing Jiwu, but all
their attacks were in vain.</p>
<p>“He’s no human,” cursed Lu Meng behind a tree.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Han Sen, also hiding behind a tree. Jing Jiwu had
rushed down the mountain and entered the woods. It was almost
impossible to see him at this point and both teams were reduced to
the starting point.</p>
<p>The viewers held their breath. Before the game, none of them had
thought that the Alliance Central Military Academy would be pushed
this far. Without a doubt, the tactics adopted by Blackhawk were
extremely successful.</p>
<p>However, Jing Jiwu was still there, and it was almost impossible
to beat him.</p>
<p>As they wished, they would see the duel between Jing Jiwu and
Han Sen, because the two players were both there. Although Han Sen
had some advantage with a teammate on his side.</p>
<p>“Ha ha, the coach of Blackhawk is really good. Lin Feng, you
think Han Sen could win?” Tang Zhenliu smiled and said.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s bow is too weak. His 11.0 bow is not enough to shoot
someone like Jing Jiwu, unless they were really close to each
other,” said Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Because of the tactics they used, they all chose
11.0 bows. Although that was successful in the beginning, facing a
player like Jing Jiwu, the weapon is their biggest weakness.” Tang
Zhenliu knowingly nodded.</p>
<p>Jing Jiwu who was moving freely turned into a real monster,
gliding quietly on the field.</p>
<p>Neither Han Sen nor Lu Meng dared to move. Without knowing where
Jing Jiwu was, they were faced with great challenge although they
were two.</p>
<p>“We cannot stay here,” said Lu Meng, ready to get up. An arrow
suddenly came to him.</p>
<p>“Move!” roared Han Sen, quickly shooting an arrow at the one
threatening Lu Meng.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s arrow were bounced off immediately and Jing Jiwu’s
arrow only slightly turned, ending up on Lu Meng’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Jing Jiwu’s arrow was meant to hit Lu’s heart, but in an archery
tournament, getting hit in the shoulder also eliminated Lu.</p>
<p>“All yours, Sen.” Lu Meng left calmly, as he had done all he
could.</p>
<p>The audience were again amazed by how powerful Jing Jiwu
was.</p>
<p>“As long as Jing Jiwu’s here, we will never lose. Blackhawk
could try as much as they want.” Students of the Alliance Central
Military Academy felt a sense of pride.</p>
<p>“Jing Jiwu is indeed the monster.”</p>
<p>“They had such an advantage. They should’ve got rid of Jing Jiwu
first instead of Qin Cheng.”</p>
<p>“Bull crap. How can a 11.0 bow be enough to get rid of Jing Jiwu
at that kind of distance?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Jing Jiwu could have completely dodged an arrow like
that with his speed.”</p>
<p>“Such a shame! Blackhawk is indeed a great team with a creative
coach. However, they ran into Jing Jiwu.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen moved continuously, searching for his opponent
everywhere. In the field mimicking a labyrinthine, Jing Jiwu was
not the only hunter. Han Sen was also looking for Jing Jiwu.</p>
<p>The two students quickly moved in the field. Although they had
not make a single shot, their movements surprised a lot of viewers
with rich combat experience.</p>
<p>Without the help of any equipment, both Han Sen and Jing Jiwu
could always avoid the danger one step early and find a favorable
spot.</p>
<p>If it were just only one time, that would not be so impressive.
However, after half an hour that you were still not able to make a
shot, because either Han Sen or Jing Jiwu could not find a good
opportunity.</p>
<p>It was like playing chess under blindfold conditions. Without
seeing each other, the two masters competed psychologically using
the entire field as their chessboard without a sound.</p>
<p>People who really understood the game could hardly breathe when
they watched this. The tension and excitement were even more
intense than a real combat.</p>
<p>No matter Han Sen or Jing Jiwu could have fallen into the range
of their opponents a million times, but they could always turn away
from a crisis.</p>
<p>Jing Jiwu had raised his bow six times and had to put it back
down. And Han Sen was the same.</p>
<p>“So impressive… Both of them…” Qiu Mingmei’s eyes lit up and
murmured.</p>
<p>“This might be the greatest duel in the history of Military
Academy League. No matter who loses, he is no loser,” Wen Xiuxiu
said.</p>
<p>The viewers on the Skynet agreed with her.</p>
<p>“Absolutely great! I’m afraid we could not see the same thing in
the future either.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that they encountered each other so early. This
should happen in the final.”</p>
<p>“I wish to see Jing Jiwu and Han Sen fighting each other again,
but this year is Jing Jiwu’s senior year. Han Sen could participate
again, but Jing Jiwu will not.”</p>
<p>“Such strong players!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want either of them to lose.”</p>
<p>“One has to beat the other.”</p>
<p>“It should be Jing Jiwu. Han Sen’s bow is too weak. If he uses a
14.0 plus bow, he would have a chance to beat Jing Jiwu however,
for tactics, he chose a 11.0.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen was born three years too late. If he’s a senior student
and has the same strength Jing Jiwu does, the duel would be even
better to watch.”</p>
