<p>To enhance team spirit among students, Blackhawk always trained
students by room. So the leader of a room would have more say in
most things. That was why they were all trying to be the
leader.</p>
<p>"Shi Zhikang, that does not really make sense. Age does not
represent anything. I think as a leader, one must be intelligent to
gain most benefits for our room. My IQ is 167. How about you? "A
gentle and delicate teenager blinked and said.</p>
<p>“Lu Meng, that is not true either. IQ is nothing. I think for a
leader the most important thing is EQ. Many with high IQ are idiots
in real life. How can someone like that be our leader?” retorted
the cunning big man Shi Zhikang.</p>
<p>“Who are you calling an idiot?” Lu Meng squared his shoulders
and wanted to argue with Shi Zhikang, but cringed as he saw Shi
raising his sturdy arm that could bear the weight of a horse.</p>
<p>“We are all in Department of Archery, so let’s decide who the
leader is by archery. Whoever is the best shot should be our leader
so that we could establish a goal together,” suggested Zhang Yang
with big eyes, bushy eyebrows and sunny disposition while doing
push-ups.</p>
<p>“New guy, what do you say?” Shi Zhikang and Lu Meng looked to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I think that fellow has a point. Since we are all archery
students, the best archer should be our leader.” As a part of the
group, Han Sen felt it was necessary for him to express his
opinion.</p>
<p>“Two votes versus one vote versus one vote. It’s done then. We
will see who is the best archer by each shooting ten arrows and
whoever gets the highest score will be our leader,” Zhang said and
jumped up. Sweat fell from his bronze skin and he disregarded it.
Hugging Shi Zhikang and Lu Meng, he said, “In any case, we are
classmates and roommates. Learning and making progress together is
the most important thing. Before graduation, we need to make our
Department of Archery the best in the entire Alliance. Brothers,
work together!”</p>
<p>“Get out!” Shi Zhikang and Lu Meng threw Zhang’s arms off. They
were tired of the preaching of this hot-blooded kid the past few
days.</p>
<p>The four young men went to the training hall, and Zhang Yang got
the highest score, shooting at bullseye every time.</p>
<p>Lu Meng was second, Han Sen third, and Shi Zhikang the biggest
and oldest was fourth.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to be the leader, runner-up, or the last,
so he got himself the third place.</p>
<p>The first three months in Blackhawk was the hardest. Every day
they must attend the collective training and lectures. They must
grasp all the basic knowledge in these three months.</p>
<p>Although they were in Department of Archery, they still needed
to learn using firearms, operating warframes, driving aircrafts and
other fundamentals.</p>
<p>Blackhawk had way better facilities than the integrated
compulsory education system. All kinds of firearms, warframes and
aircrafts can be practiced on and Han Sen had learned many things
that he had not even heard of before. In these three months, Han
Sen was learning like a sponge constantly absorbing water.</p>
<p>Three months later, all four of them passed a comprehensive
assessment and officially became Blackhawk students.</p>
<p>In addition to a few compulsory courses, the rest were all
elective courses. Apart from not being allowed to leave the school,
they were quite free. As long as one could pass the semi-annual
assessment, one could even skip all the courses.</p>
<p>But if one failed the assessment, there was only one opportunity
to take it again, and if one failed the second time, one would be
expelled from school with no exception.</p>
<p>There was a special teleport station on campus, and anyone could
go to God’s Sanctuary at any time. There was not too many
restrictions about that.</p>
<p>The four young men who had just passed the comprehensive
assessment ordered a few dishes and several bottles of wine at the
cafeteria, celebrating the beginning of their life in
Blackhawk.</p>
<p>When they were enjoying the meal, the holographic image in the
cafeteria became a match, and instead of combat, it was a game of
Hand of God.</p>
<p>“Ji Yanran!” Shi Zhikang suddenly shouted, staring at the pretty
girl in the holographic image.</p>
<p>Even Lu Meng and Zhang Yang were staring at Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>“She is famous?” Han Sen saw Ji Yanran and was reminded of their
agreement on the way here. But then he was too busy and forgot
about it.</p>
<p>“Are you serious? You don’t know our campus belle? She is a
junior now. Her sweet face, seductive figure, fair skin and 36D…”
Shi Zhikang stopped and looked around. He continued when seeing
everyone was paying attention to the image, “Ji Yanran is also the
president of Hand of God Society. She is among top 5 at this game
in our school. A goddess with both brain and beauty. She has many
suitors but no one was successful.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“No one is good enough for her. I heard that her family has
quite some influence in the military, and ordinary families simply
are not their match,” said Shi Zhikang with some regret.</p>
<p>“Even if her family was okay with it, Ji Yanran will certainly
not go out with you.” Lu Meng curled his lips.</p>
<p>“As if she would go out with you!” Shi Zhikang was unwilling to
show any weakness.</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, where there is a goal there is hope. You have to stay
hopeful. Since Ji Yanran is the president of Hand of God Society,
let’s join that society and try to approach her. If she sees our
potentials, maybe she will go out with one of us,” suggested Zhang
Yang confidently.</p>
<p>Shi Zhikang and Lu Meng’s eyes lit up, and they agreed
hurriedly, “Great idea. Let’s go. We will apply for Hand of God
Society right now.”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could finish eating, he was dragged by the three
to Hand of God Society.</p>
<p>When they got there, all four of them were stunned and
understood the meaning of “people mountain people sea.” The line of
applicants was so long that it almost went out of the school
gate.</p>
<p>“Ahem, I think we are so handsome that we don’t need to be with
Ji Yanran all day and she will still go out with us,” Shi Zhikang
said.</p>
<p>“Shi, well-said. We are in Department of Archery and must join
an archery society. No need to waste our time here,” said Lu Meng
solemnly.</p>
<p>“I agree with both of you.” Han Sen nodded quickly when seeing
the long line. If he waited in the line, his whole day would be
wasted.</p>
<p>“Go in the line now! A real man never quits.” Zhang Yang grabbed
Shi and Lu and joined the line.</p>
<p>Han Sen was lucky that Zhang Yang did not have a third hand. It
chanced that his comlink was ringing and he saw the call was from
Fang Jingqi.</p>
