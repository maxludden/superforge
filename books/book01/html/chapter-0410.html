<p>Although this mountain was also covered with snow on the top,
but it was much higher and steeper than the one Han Sen
remembered.</p>
<p>Where the Firebird was seemed to be a volcano, while this one
was much rockier.</p>
<p>“Is it a mistake?” Han Sen felt upset because he wasted all they
and ended up in a wrong place.</p>
<p>“We can’t go any farther. It is the habitat of the evil goblins
in front of us.” Jia Changfeng was leading the way stopped and
asked everyone to pause. Han Sen got off the back of the golden
growler, climbed up a dune with the rest and looked toward the
mountain.</p>
<p>The mountain was arid. No plants were growing on it. Even in the
desert, it was still an uncommon scene.</p>
<p>Different from the white sand in the desert, the rocks on the
mountain were black. Only the top of the mountain was covered in
white snow.</p>
<p>On the black mountain walls, there were many thickly dotted
holes, which would make a person with trypophobia vomit.</p>
<p>There were many red centipedes as thick as arms climbing out of
the holes. The centipedes were about 6 feet long and looked
extremely ugly, crawling around on the mountain walls.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look at them. Although they looked like
centipedes, they had a triangular head on each end of their body
which was made of red bones. Connecting each bone was a pair of red
hands with only three fingers. As they moved, the small hands were
moving like the feet of centipedes, which was creepy to look
at.</p>
<p>Some of the holes on the mountain were especially wide, about 3
feet in diameter. Han Sen was staring at a big hole and saw a giant
evil goblin slithering out of it. The evil goblin was as thick as a
barrel and more than 30 feet long. A part of its body was still in
the hole, so Han Sen could not tell how large it actually was.</p>
<p>The giant evil goblin twisted its body on the mountain wall as
the hands on its body moved, which was sickening.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, that evil goblin king is very scary. I suggest you
think twice before trying anything,” Xiao Wei whispered. Han Sen
nodded but his gaze was still lingering on the giant evil
goblin.</p>
<p>It looked quite strong. Could it be a super creature? Han Sen
pondered and summoned the horn bow and bony fish arrow, trying to
take a shot at it.</p>
<p>If it was just a sacred-blood creature, it would not be able to
block a sacred-blood arrow with the spinning force.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Xiao Lingfeng quickly held Han Sen’s hand
down seeing what Han Sen was doing.</p>
<p>“Since I’m already here, of course I am trying to kill the
sacred-blood evil goblin,” said Han Sen matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Xiao Lingfeng became annoyed and said, “Their bony bodies are as
tough as metal. It is difficult for one to hurt them with beast
soul weapons on the same level as the creatures. Even if the bow
and arrow you’re holding are both sacred-blood beast souls, the
distance is too long for you to hurt the king, not to mention your
weapons might not be sacred-blood. These creatures are very petty.
If you started to attack them, the whole group will come this way.
You might be able to run away on your sacred-blood mount, but we
will die for sure.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Since that’s the case, you can leave first. I
will join you after I kill them,” Han Sen pondered and said.</p>
<p>“You don’t think you can really kill the king alone, do you?”
Jia Yan stared at Han Sen with her eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Here’s the water. Leave now. If I fail and die here, you will
have enough water to go out.” Han Sen threw the majority of the
water bags to the guys, only saving a few for himself.</p>
<p>The group looked at Han Sen in surprise. Han Sen had given the
majority of his water to them. If they took the water away, it
would be difficult for Han Sen to leave the desert with the
remaining water after killing the evil goblins, if he could kill
the creatures at all.</p>
<p>The four persons were all confused, not understanding what Han
Sen was thinking.</p>
<p>They had no idea about the golden growler’s real speed. If the
mount went at its full speed, the remaining water was enough for
Han Sen to come and go several times.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you really want to kill the evil goblin king, maybe
we can work together to do it.” Xiao Wei felt reluctant to leave
Han Sen alone since he had given them most of his water.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. Go ahead. I could do this alone.” Han Sen did
not want to waste more time. He would kill this goblin king first
and then hurry to find the fire bird.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, think about it. These creatures are very fast in the
desert. Even with your sacred-blood mount, you might not be able to
outrun them,” Jia Changfeng also said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t leave now, I will start to shoot.” Han Sen aimed
his arrow at the evil goblins.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. This guy is crazy.” Xiao Lingfeng did not think Han
Sen was joking and quickly pulled his sister away.</p>
<p>Jia Changfeng also pulled Jia Yan away with him. They did not
want to cross the evil goblin king.</p>
<p>They had once met an evil goblin in the desert, which was only a
mutant one. Even so, the situation was extremely risky, not to
mention this one was definitely a sacred-blood king.</p>
<p>In addition, the sacred-blood king was also leading an entire
group of twenty mutant creatures and a thousand primitive
creatures. Once trapped in the group, it did not even matter
however good a fighter one was. All of the creatures were
poisonous. Once injured by them, one would die most of the
times.</p>
<p>“Be careful. Even when cut in half, the evil goblins would not
die immediately. They could still launch deadly attacks. And try
not to touch their blood, which is poisonous,” Jia Yan said to Han
Sen before she left.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Han Sen’s gaze was fixed upon the giant evil
goblin king. When the group went far, he pulled the bow to the
fullest.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen shot the arrow at the evil goblin
king.</p>
