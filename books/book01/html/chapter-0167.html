<p>Han Sen hesitated, since he did not recognize this student.</p>
<p>“It is natural that you do not know me. I am also in the
Department of Archery. You did our department right in Starry Cup.
I would give the seat to none but you. Come here.” The student
smiled and offered Han Sen his own seat.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Han Sen could not imagine he would enjoy such
treatment.</p>
<p>“It really is Han Sen.”</p>
<p>“His warframe game was so exciting.”</p>
<p>“Is he also one of the stars’ fans?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Many students whispered and cast a few glances his way, but they
were too well-educated to bother Han Sen.</p>
<p>As the class began, Professor Yan came in with two young men.
One of them Han Sen was familiar with. With a handsome smile, Tang
Zhenliu greeted the students.</p>
<p>Another guy had an angled face. Han Sen knew he was the Chosen
that ranked sixth, Yu Zhiming. Since Han Sen did not go to the
ranking rounds, he had never fought Yu.</p>
<p>Blackhawk students were polite and gave no more than applause.
When Tang was introduced, Zhang Yang clapped so hard his hands were
almost swollen.</p>
<p>Professor Yan still used his old-fashioned way to teach, but
when talking about different theories, he would ask Tang Zhenliu
and Yu Mingzhi to do demonstrations.</p>
<p>With the participation of two stars, the teaching effect was
perfect. Both stars showed high attainment in martial arts, and
their demonstrations were successful.</p>
<p>“In a few words, the ultimate goal of the martial arts was to
leverage one’s own strength. And in real combat, in addition to
strength, the psychological factor would also be very important.
Hence in the various categories of martial arts, there would be
training for psychological gaming. For example, the focus of Tai
Chi was the application of the true and false forces.”</p>
<p>Professor Yan continued with his monotonous voice, “Another
example is the black and white boxing. Please welcome Yu Zhiming
and Tang Zhenliu to demonstrate black and white boxing for us.”</p>
<p>Yu Zhiming cut in, “Professor Yan, if it is just the two of us,
the students would not feel for themselves the essence of black and
white boxing. Would you invite two students to spar with Tang and
me?”</p>
<p>The proposal led to applause. To spar with such stars was of
course a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>“Tang, what do you think?” Professor Yan looked at Tang, as the
school did not arrange any interactions with the students and he
must seek his approval first.</p>
<p>“This is your class. I will follow your lead,” Tang said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Tang also glanced at Yu Mingzhi. He knew what Yu was thinking.
Yu had fought him in the contest before and lost miserably. Now Yu
was afraid he would lose again and did not want to be humiliated in
front of the class.</p>
<p>“That being the case, we will choose two students to spar with
Yu Mingzhi and Tang Zhenliu in black and white boxing. Any
volunteers?” Professor Yan glanced across the room.</p>
<p>Almost all the students raised their hands at the same time,
except for Han Sen and a few others.</p>
<p>Tang had noticed Han Sen a long time ago. Seeing Han Sen not
raising his hand, he felt relieved. Han Sen was so great at this
that he would definitely lose if Han Sen came up on stage.</p>
<p>As Tang Zhenrong let out a sigh of relief, Yu Mingzhi suddenly
asked, “Professor Yan, I heard that Blackhawk has a student named
Ouyang Xiaosan who is in the top ten of the Military Academy
League?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Ouyang is not here today,” Professor Yan said casually.
“Would you choose someone else yourself?”</p>
<p>Yu Mingzhi smiled and asked the students, “Besides Ouyang
Xiaosan, who is the best martial artist here?”</p>
<p>All eyes were on Han Sen. Although they had never seen him
practicing martial arts, they could tell from his skills of
warframe operation that his fitness was great.</p>
<p>Yu Mingzhi paused. He did not expect the students to have the
same candidate in mind. It seemed that the student that was looked
at was very influential in the school.</p>
<p>But Yu did not take Han Sen too seriously. There were so many
military school students in First God’s Sanctuary, yet few were
among the Chosen. As one of the Chosen, he did not really think of
the students as his true opponents.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu saw the look in Yu’s eyes and knew he was about to
do something stupid.</p>
<p>But Yu did not know what was on Tang’s mind. He smiled at Han
Sen and asked, “What is your name? Would you spar with me in black
and white boxing?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit upset. He did not raise his hand, so why would
Yu appoint him?</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Sen.”</p>
<p>“You will be great.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>His classmates were very supportive and curious about Han Sen’s
martial arts skill level.</p>
<p>Yu Mingzhi was glad to see that Han Sen’s popularity even
exceeded himself as a star.</p>
<p>He wanted to appoint Ouyang Xiaosan to show off, so that these
students would realize the difference between a military student
and the Chosen. However, Ouyang was not there, and beating a nobody
would not help him achieve his objective.</p>
<p>“Friend, your classmates have strongly recommended you, so
please come up. It is just a practice, and the result does not
matter,” Yu Mingzhi smiled at Han Sen and said.</p>
<p>“Wow. Yu Mingzhi is simply asking for trouble!” Tang smiled
bitterly. He had never seen someone praying for his own destruction
like this.</p>
