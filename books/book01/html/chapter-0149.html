<p>Perhaps it was arranged by fate, Huaxing Station had designated
Fang Mingquan to host the live broadcast of Starry Cup in Blackhawk
Division.</p>
<p>“Contest Center” was, after all, only a temporary show and went
off the air soon after the contest. It will resume until the
contest next year.</p>
<p>Since Fang Minquan had no shows to host at this point, he chose
to host the live broadcast of Starry Cup in Blackhawk Division when
asked to choose his next show.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan and Han Sen seemed to have been brought together
by fate once again.</p>
<p>But Fang Mingquan did not know that Dollar was a student at
Blackhawk.</p>
<p>At the moment, Fang was quite distressed because he did not know
which items he should cover.</p>
<p>Because there were many items, some of them were arranged at the
same time. As he had brought limited manpower, he had to pick and
choose which ones to cover.</p>
<p>“Liu, what were the traditionally strong items of Blackhawk?”
Fang Mingquan asked his assistant while checking some data.</p>
<p>Liu did some searching on his smart device and quickly replied,
“Blackhawk’s strongest item is men’s singles in martial arts. In
last year’s Starry Cup, they got the third place in the final of
the entire Alliance. The student who won is still studying here.
His name is Ouyang Xiaosan, and he has also signed up this
year.”</p>
<p>“Any other strong item?” Fang Mingquan asked.</p>
<p>“Not much. Their Warframe Society and Hand of God Society had
good performance, which was not that outstanding across the
Alliance. They were both top 20 to top 10.” Liu looked at the data
and said with a smile, “But it is interesting that with a terrible
record in archery, Blackhawk had recruited lots of students
specialized in archery this year. I believe they will do much
better than in previous years.”</p>
<p>“Archery?” Fang Mingquan slightly frowned. Archery was, after
all, an unpopular game. The popular ones in the Alliance were
mainly related to aircraft, warframe or combat. Archery was quite
peripheral, because most people were even more willing to see a
game of firearm.</p>
<p>“Anchor, the only highlight in Blackhawk will be martial arts.
We should cover Ouyang Xiaosan’s games and throw in some warframe
and Hand of God matches in between,” suggested Liu.</p>
<p>“Still two days until the games start. We can decide after
learning more about Blackhawk.” Fang Mingquan looked at the time.
“It’s late. Let’s call it a day. We have been working all night.
Some snacks now would be a good idea.”</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan and Liu left the room assigned to them by the
school and went to a cafeteria.</p>
<p>It was midnight. The cafeteria was almost empty and food was
still being sold at the smart machines.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan looked inside the hall, and only one student was
sitting in the corner, eating. Fang then took the food they just
bought and sat opposite the student.</p>
<p>“Fellow, you are eating so late,” Sitting opposite the student,
Fang Mingquan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Fang believed that the student would recognize himself, because
judging from his age, the student must be in First God’s Sanctuary
and should have watched Contest Center, of which Fang was the
host.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked up and did not recognize Fang. He had read and
appreciated “A King Marches in Loneliness” written by him, but he
had no time to watch Contest center. That was why he had heard of
Fang Mingquan, but had never seen his face, and thus could not have
recognized him.</p>
<p>“Because I just finished training and felt a bit hungry.” Han
Sen looked at Fang Mingquan and Liu, wondering who they were, as
they were a bit too old to be students.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan was a little disappointed that Han Sen did not
recognize him, but soon let it go. He asked casually while eating,
“What is your name? And which department are you from?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Archery Department,” Han Sen answered simply.</p>
<p>“Archery Department!” Fang Mingquan and Liu were surprised that
they had met a specially enrolled student the first day they had
arrived.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan looked Han Sen up and down. “So you are from the
Department of Archery. Have you applied for Starry Cup? Which items
in archery did you sign up for?”</p>
<p>“None in archery.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“What did you sign up for then?” Liu could not help but
asked.</p>
<p>“Warframe,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“So you are in the Warframe Society?” Liu asked.</p>
<p>“No, I’m in the Heavy Warframe Society.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Liu knew what the Heavy Warframe Society was about since he had
graduated from a military school as well. That society was most
likely full of people who were just wasting their time.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan said with a smile, “Heavy Warframe Society is also
a society of warframe. Sen, you must be great at that then. Which
items did you sign up for?”</p>
<p>“I have enrolled in all the items, with one exception due to a
time conflict,” Han Sen thought about it and said.</p>
<p>Liu was even more convinced that Han Sen was a dawdler. Although
there were many warframe items, the differences between them were
huge. Most people would focus on one to two items to strive for the
best results possible.</p>
<p>“So, what kind of performance can we expect from you?” Fang
Mingquan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I will try to get championship in all the items I have signed
up for,” Han Sen casually replied.</p>
<p>Liu almost choked on his drink when hearing his reply. After
coughing for a while, Liu cast an odd gaze at Han, “Fellow, I think
you should sign up for more items then, such as Hand of God. The
more championships the better, right?”</p>
<p>“Hand of God is boring.” Han Sen did not care about the irony in
Liu’s words.</p>
<p>“Why?” Fang Mingquan was quite curious.</p>
<p>“Because all the opponents are too weak,” said Han Sen
casually.</p>
<p>Liu regarded Han Sen, unable to believe what he had heard. Liu
felt that students nowadays were so arrogant that they would say
anything just to impress others.</p>
