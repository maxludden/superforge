<p>“Who told you about the protection mechanism?” Yang Manli stared
at Han Sen madly. Of course, she knew about this trick.</p>
<p>“What protection mechanism? I do not understand what you are
talking about?” Han Sen looked innocent.</p>
<p>“You won’t tell? Go get a 7.0 practice bow and some arrows,”
Yang Manli calmed down and said coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what she wanted to do, and did what she
asked.</p>
<p>“You know the standard stance to draw the string?” Yang Manli
looked at Han Sen and asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“Very good, pull the string to the fullest on standard stance,”
Yang Manli said quietly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had worked hard on archery so his stance was perfect and
he easily pulled the string to the fullest.</p>
<p>“Good stance.” Han Sen was surprised to hear Yang Manli’s
compliment.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Captain.” Still, Han Sen knew he was in trouble.</p>
<p>“Hold this position until midnight. If you move during this
period and I do not get the answer I want, you do not need to show
up here again. Even if the stationmaster came here herself, one of
us must go.” Yang Manli turned to leave.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang going away, the soldiers ran back and the one who
told Han Sen about the protection mechanism felt guilty and said,
“Sorry buddy, I did not expect Yang to be onto you. I did you harm
instead of good.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a few hours. I’ll be fine.” Han Sen said
casually.</p>
<p>“Do not underestimate the standard stance. Twenty minutes was
all right, but two hours is just torture. A 7.0 bow is not a joke,
usually we can’t even last two hours with a 6.0 bow. It’s four
hours until midnight. Yang is really brutal this time.”</p>
<p>“I say let’s go apologize. Just tell her we all told him about
the loophole. Or else he would probably not be able to use his arms
ever again.”</p>
<p>“If we have to. Judging from her look, we would suffer as
well.”</p>
<p>The soldiers complained and sighed.</p>
<p>“No need. I’ll give it a shot. My endurance has always been
good. Four hours, I think there should be no problem.” Han Sen
called the soldiers who were going to apologize back.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how good your endurance is. It’s
torture.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled, “I’ve seen worse. Don’t go yet. If I can’t do
it, you could go then. Maybe by then Yang Manli will see how
miserable I am and lessen the punishment.”</p>
<p>“That is also true. Buddy, you hang in there first. Let us know
when it gets bad. We will go and confess.” The soldiers were
loyal.</p>
<p>Hen Sen nodded and did not speak. Remaining motionless was
sometimes even worse than violent movement, especially when he was
also drawing a 7.0 bow.</p>
<p>In the beginning he didn’t feel much, but after half an hour,
his arm muscles began to feel numb, and with the passage of time,
this numb feeling was more and more intense.</p>
<p>In just an hour, Han Sen was sweating like rain, his arms
burning and whole body trembling.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and started to practice Jadeskin. A
spring-like coolness flowed through all his veins, where the numb
feeling was gradually relieved.</p>
<p>Through the monitor, Yang Manli would glance at Han Sen from
time to time. She saw him keeping the stance but started to tremble
when it was approaching an hour. His endurance was already beyond
her expectation. Even the soldiers can only last this long.</p>
<p>Yang Manli predicted he could last about at most one and a half
hours, certainly less than two hours.</p>
<p>“Cheating in your first training session. I have to put you
through hell.” Yang Manli did not really want a name from Han Sen.
His silence was a quality she could appreciate and if he had
confessed about the person who had told him, she would have looked
down on him.</p>
<p>After working for a while, Yang Manli checked on him again when
it was an hour and a half, and found he was still standing
there.</p>
<p>Yang Manli could not help but frown, as Han Sen looked better
now than half an hour ago. He had stopped trembling and was
sweating less. In general, he looked more relaxed.</p>
<p>“He moved?” Yang Manli was not sure and played the footage
backward, noticing Han Sen had not moved in the last 30
minutes.</p>
<p>“Odd!” Yang Manli did not go back to work, but paid full
attention to Han Sen’s image.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been standing for two hours.</p>
<p>“Buddy, you’re awesome. Can you keep going?”</p>
<p>“Your endurance is out of this world. If you are this good in
every aspect, you could definitely go to the Alliance Central
Military Academy.”</p>
<p>“Brother, you a real man!” A soldier gave him a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>“Let us know if you can’t keep going. Don’t risk hurting your
own body. It’s not worth it.”</p>
<p>Keeping his body motionless, Han Sen smiled and said, “I feel
okay. I can definitely hold until midnight. No need to check on
me.”</p>
<p>“Brother, if you can really hold until midnight, you will be
under my protection in the future.”</p>
<p>“Your protection? Do you dare to fight Yang or Qin Xuan?”</p>
<p>“Ahem, I was just saying. Do not be so serious.”</p>
<p>The soldiers took a shower and went to the cafeteria, leaving
Han Sen alone in the gym. He was practicing Jadeskin secretly and
felt its power welling from every body cell, eliminating his
fatigue.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had insisted for three hours, even Yang Manli was
shocked. She even doubted if the soldiers had hacked the monitor
and all she saw was a loop.</p>
<p>Soon she ruled out that possibility and left the office for the
gym.</p>
