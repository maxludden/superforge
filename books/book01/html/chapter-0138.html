<p>In addition to Zhao Lianhua, Ji Yanran was dying to find Han
Sen. Now she was sure the boyfriend was not Ouyang Xiaosan, because
during the match against Li Yufeng, Ouyang was participating in the
training of Martial Arts Society and could not have been at the
match.</p>
<p>Also, Ji Yanran did not believe Ouyang could have beaten Li
Yufeng by 20 points.</p>
<p>“Who was it? Our school has such a hidden master at Hand of
God.” Ji Yanran thought of that hateful ID and vowed, “I will find
you after all.”</p>
<p>“If you really want to find him out, I have a way,” Qu Lili said
with a smile.</p>
<p>“What way?” Ji Yanran did not believe Qu Lili.</p>
<p>“In fact, the approach is very simple. Since he used that ID,
certainly he is one of your admirers. All you need to do is to host
a Hand of God contest at school and say the champion’s prize is a
kiss from you. I think he will participate for sure,” said Qu,
blinking.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran rolled her eyes. “What a bad idea! What if he does not
show up?”</p>
<p>Qu Lili suddenly grinned at Ji Yanran and said, “So you are
willing to kiss him if he’s the champion?”</p>
<p>“Hey! That bastard, how could I…” Ji Yanran was mad and shy at
the same time. She grabbed Qu Lili and threatened, “Little girl,
wait and see how I tame you.”</p>
<p>Qui Lili quickly begged for mercy, but Ji Yanran continued to
tickle her and until she was almost out of breath.</p>
<p>Qu Lili’s idea was not that great, but it did remind Ji Yanran
that in more than half a month, a school-wide contest named “Starry
Cup” sponsored by Starry Group would start. The prize would be
great and maybe that person would show up and participate.</p>
<p>But Ji Yanran did not know which department he was in. Hand of
God was just one item in Starry Cup, which also included combat,
warframe, archery and other items.</p>
<p>If that person did not come to Hand of God, but registered in
another item, it would be difficult to tell who he was.</p>
<p>“It calls for a little trick,” Ji Yanran thought with a devious
smile on her face.</p>
<p>In the training hall, several students were sitting
together.</p>
<p>“Have you heard that the champion of Hand of God in Starry Cup
could get a set of Z-steel weapons of King series and visit the
main factory of Starry Group.”</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t know that?”</p>
<p>“I heard that Starry Group had also invited the president of
Hand of God Society to visit their main factory.”</p>
<p>“The president of Hand of God Society? Isn’t that Ji
Yanran?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the visit is five days and four nights.”</p>
<p>“Wow, I’m definitely going to participate in the contest this
time.”</p>
<p>“What is the point? This is clearly meant for Ji Yanran’s
boyfriend. It’s their honeymoon.”</p>
<p>“Everything is possible. People make mistakes. What if Ji
Yanran’s boyfriend did not do so well this time?”</p>
<p>“He beat Li Yifeng by twenty points. Even if he makes 20
mistakes, he would still be as good as Li. What chance do you
stand?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Soon the news was spread throughout the school. When Qu Lili
heard the news and asked Ji Yanran, the latter smiled and cunningly
said, “That is what other people say. I have not mentioned a
thing.”</p>
<p>“You are obviously stealing my idea. Pay me for the copyright!”
Qu Lili reached out to tickle Ji.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran thought that this could force Han to register for the
Hand of God contest, but little did she know that Han Sen had not
even heard about it because he had been practicing driving a heavy
warframe, Builder.</p>
<p>This was more fun than driving the training warframes. Builder’s
versatility allowed Han Sen to reach the limit of his speed.</p>
<p>In principal’s office, Luo Xiangyang looked at Principal Wei and
complained, “This is nonsense. How could you give the 7th warehouse
to Heavy Warframe Society as their training ground? And the three
heavy warframes are totally beyond the abilities of those students.
What if there is an accident?”</p>
<p>“Luo, you have to look at the specific circumstances. Those are
good students and that’s why I gave them a relaxed training
environment,” Wei said slowly.</p>
<p>“More like rich and powerful students.” Luo Xiangyang said with
some disdain.</p>
<p>“You should know that the school has its own difficulties. Luo,
you need to get rid of this temper of yours,” said Wei
earnestly.</p>
<p>Luo Xiangyang’s face was still gloomy. He said, “I do not care
what privileges they have. I can give them the warehouse, but the
three heavy warframes can’t be wasted like this. I must get them
back.”</p>
<p>Luo left, disregarding Principal Wei’s calling him.</p>
<p>Wei shook his head and sighed. “A nasty temper indeed.”</p>
<p>He thought about it and let it go. That young lady would not
touch those heavy warframes anyway, so there should be no problem
that Luo were to take them away.</p>
<p>Luo Xiangyang stepped toward the 7th warehouse and was quite
upset. He had wanted this warehouse for a while and the school
never agreed. Then they gave it to the Heavy Warframe Society.</p>
<p>He knew everything about Heavy Warframe Society–just several
people who were wasting their time. Who would pay attention to
heavy warframes anyway? Normal soldiers would not even have the
chance to touch them. only the specialized soldiers would like
them.</p>
<p>He was now the coach of the Warframe Society, which was doing
very well and had lots of members, among which a lot were
excellent. However, their training field and equipment were quite
lacking.</p>
<p>He wanted to use the 7th warehouse as a training field, but the
school had never approved and later gave it to Heavy Warframe
Society. How could he stay calm knowing that?</p>
<p>But Luo Xiangyang also knew that Principal Wei was having a hard
time. So he was fine with giving them the warehouse, but the three
heavy warframes should not be wasted like that. He planned to take
them back to his society and pick a few students to practice on
them. if possible, he’d like to train those students into
professional heavy warframe operators.</p>
<p>When Luo Xiangyang came to the 7th warehouse, he saw Builder was
driven by someone, doing a lot of strange moves on the training
ground.</p>
