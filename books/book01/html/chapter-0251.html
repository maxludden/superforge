<h2>Ending an Era</h2>
<h3>Chapter 251</h3>

<p>The atmosphere during the training of the school team was
somewhat depressing. After they saw the result of the draw, many
old members found it devastating to meet the Alliance Central
Military Academy in the second round.</p>
<p>Invincible monster. For the old team members, the pressure was
simply too much.</p>
<p>The schedule also disturbed Situ Xiang’s plan. Originally, she
planned to let the team practice in rounds of matches. With Han Sen
in the team, they could at least make it to the fifth round.</p>
<p>After other team members gained enough practice and confidence,
they could then face the Alliance Central Military Academy. Even if
they could not win, they would have a decent performance.</p>
<p>However, now in the second round they would run into the
monster, and if they lost at the round, they would have and even
worse ranking than last year. Situ Xiang knew that they could not
lose this one, but even with Han Sen on the team, she was not
confident.</p>
<p>After all, the main item in the archery tournament was a team
match, whereas the individual match was more of a performing
nature. The schools ranking mainly depended on the result of the
team match.</p>
<p>In Blackhawk, except for Han Sen, there were very few people she
could rely on. The old team members had lost their confidence, and
the new ones could not be completely trusted in such a big game
yet.</p>
<p>The current situation made it very difficult for Situ Xiang. She
thought secretly, “Damn you, hand. Why did you have such bad luck
in the draw?”</p>
<p>No matter how bad the luck was, as the coach, she had to boost
the team’s morale.</p>
<p>It was not working though. Basically, all the old team members
thought they would lose for sure. Even if they could make it to the
second round, they would lose then.</p>
<p>“So unfortunate! Such a strong opponent in the second round,”
Shi Zhikang couldn’t help but complained.</p>
<p>“It is a good thing. Only strong opponents could bring us more
progress,” said Zhang Yang excitedly, full of hope.</p>
<p>Lu Meng said casually, “More progress but less opportunity. With
our current team, even Han Sen could not get us past the second
round.”</p>
<p>“The result does not matter that much, as long as we grow. We
have not tried yet, so how do you know that we would lose. Do you
agree, Han Sen?” Zhang Yang asked Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Of course we will win.” Han Sen smiled and said, “Don’t you
feel it is quite interesting?”</p>
<p>“What is interesting?” asked Shi Zhikang, puzzled.</p>
<p>“The Alliance Central Military Academy is the king in the league
and Jing Jiwu is the number one military school student. If we beat
them, we will be ending an era. Don’t you think it’s interesting?”
Asked Han Sen, smiling.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel is interesting at all. I would rather have a week
opponent,” Shi Zhikang smiled bitterly and said.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do not take Jing Jiwu lightly. He is a formidable
man,” said Lu Meng solemnly.</p>
<p>“I never take anyone lightly, but I do feel it is very
interesting. To end a dynasty and bury it in history, I cannot
think of something more exciting than this,” Han Sen said
seriously.</p>
<p>“Exactly, Han Sen, I support you.” Zhang Yang had fires burning
in his eyes, and it looked like he could not wait to fight.</p>
<p>“You are not normal, but since we are roommates, if you decide
to go, I will go with you. I am just afraid that the coach would
not give us the opportunity,” Shi Zhikang said worriedly.</p>
<p>Lu Meng curled his lips. “Relax, we will definitely go. The
coach is clever and she would not use those old teammates who have
lost all their confidence. It is very likely we will represent the
school.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As Han Sen was walking toward the cafeteria, his comlink rang.
It was from Tang Zhenliu. When he answered the call, the
holographic images of Lin Feng and Tang Zhenliu both appeared.</p>
<p>“Have you decided to participate in the archery tournament?”
asked Tang Zhenliu hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I am in the archery department, and as a member of the school
team, I will definitely be participating. Is there a problem?” Han
Sen did not understand why Tang Zhenliu would care about this.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu did not speak but looked at Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“Do you think you could win?” asked Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” replied Han Sen quickly. Jing Jiwu was so strong
that he could not tell whether he could win before actually
fighting the monster.</p>
<p>“I’ll be watching your game,” said Lin Feng calmly.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast an odd look at Lin Feng, not knowing what he
meant.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu couldn’t help but explain, “Han Sen, Jing Jiwu used
to go to the same school we went to. He was as strong as Lin Feng.
Unfortunately, he transferred to the Alliance Central Military
Academy later, and never had a chance to have a proper fight with
Lin Feng. It will definitely be difficult battle. You feel nervous
now?”</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged and said, “I have never thought that I would
lose, so there is nothing to be nervous about.”</p>
<p>“If Jing Jiwu has heard this, he will definitely be very happy.
Should I tell him you said that?” Tang Zhenliu grinned.</p>
<p>“As you like,” Han Sen said casually.</p>
<p>“Be very careful. Jing Jiwu is the most talented and
hard-working guy I have ever seen,” Lin Feng suddenly cut in.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised, and nodded seriously.</p>
<p>Someone that was able to get such a remark from Lin Feng was
definitely incredibly formidable.</p>
<p>“Well then, we’ll go there and watch your game.” Tang Zhenliu
quickly hung up and called Jing Jiwu.</p>
<p>“Number one military school student, that sounds so much better
than Dollar.” Han Sen touched his chin contentedly.</p>
<p>However, to gain that title, he must get rid of the guy who was
named the monster.</p>
<p>When he came to the cafeteria, Ji Yanran had already took a
table. Luckily her roommate was not here, and Han Sen felt he was
about to get lucky.</p>
<p>“I heard that the archery school team will run into Jing Jiwu in
the second round,” said Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>“Yes, what about it?” Han Sen was surprised that even Ji Yanran
started to care about the archery tournament.</p>
<p>“If you could beat Jing Jiwu, I will treat you to a four-day
deluxe couple’s tour to the Aegean Sea,” Ji Yanran blinked and
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly felt a strong desire to win. His eyes lighting
up like a lightbulb, Han Sen muttered, “four-day… deluxe… couple’s
tour…”</p>
