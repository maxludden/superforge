        <p>On the day of the game, Han Sen drove Silver Killer out of the
            7th warehouse, because it was allowed to use one’s own warframe in
            the warframe items.</p>
        <p>After all, all players were skilled in different types of
            warframes, and it was impossible to ask everyone to drive the same
            type.</p>
        <p>For those who did not have their own warframe, the contest
            committee would even provide their warframes. Since Starry Group
            was the sponsor, the warframes provided were not bad, normally
            worth one million to several millions.</p>
        <p>But many students were still using their own. Generally
            speaking, the advanced players would all bring the warframes they
            used every day. This way, they would be more familiar with the
            functions and parameters and able to eliminate errors.</p>
        <p>The advanced players from the Warframe Society all had their own
            warframes, some of which were even worth a dozen million.</p>
        <p>“Sen, I did not know you are rich! This warframe is gorgeous!”
            Shi stared at Silver Killer.</p>
        <p>Among the Heavy Warframe Society members, Fatty, Skinny, Lu Meng
            and Wang Mengmeng all had their own warframes in addition to Han
            Sen.</p>
        <p>Wang Mengmeng’s was the most high-end one. Lu Meng’s also looked
            quite expensive.</p>
        <p>But when it came to the appearance, Silver Killer was the
            winner. The streamline shape and exquisite craftsmanship was simply
            beyond any mass-produced products. It was a true limited edition,
            and the only one in the laboratory.</p>
        <p>All prototypes would be different as the design concept and
            technology changed. And Silver Killer was especially unique.</p>
        <p>“It is just an ordinary warframe, and doesn’t even have a weapon
            system,” Han Sen told the truth about the only flaw of Silver
            Killer.</p>
        <p>“With a weapon system, it would not look so fine,” Lu Meng
            said.</p>
        <p>The Heavy Warframe Society members went toward the match
            venue.</p>
        <p>Silver Killer caught a lot of attention, but more people were
            attracted by Wang Mengmeng’s warframe. Some people even shouted
            out, “Destroyer, someone is driving a Destroyer. Who is this
            player? Which master in the Warframe Society is it?”</p>
        <p>More and more people were noticing the warframe Wang Mengmeng
            was driving. Destroyer had been discontinued a few years ago. As a
            classic luxury model, many warframe lovers took pride in owning a
            Destroyer. And it was so incredible to see it in the school-wide
            match.</p>
        <p>Although the performance of Destroyer was just as good as the
            current ones, its value as a collective was over a hundred million.
            Who would drive it to a match!</p>
        <p>Outside the venue, more and more people were paying attention to
            Destroyer, and many were inquiring about who the driver was.</p>
        <p>Later, they were stunned by what they learned. The person
            driving Destroyer was not one of the advanced player in the
            Warframe Society, but a Heavy Warframe Society member. And they
            also learned that the driver was a girl in freshman year and her
            fellow society members were almost all freshmen.</p>
        <p>“Heavy Warframe Society is in the match? Shouldn’t they go
            participate in some moving contest?”</p>
        <p>“Do not say that. There is at least ‘warframe’ in their
            name.”</p>
        <p>“It’s a pity. Such a great warframe. It is the Destroyer!”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Naturally no one was optimistic about the Heavy Warframe
            Society’s performance. After all, no matter how good a warframe
            was, the key was the player.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Fang Mingquan had started the live and
            focused the camera on the Heavy Warframe Society members. The
            holographic footage was being uploaded to the Skynet
            simultaneously. Many loyal fans had been waiting in front of their
            screens already. Most of them did not care too much about the
            content, but who the host was.</p>
        <p>With Fang’s reputation, the live started with several hundred
            thousand viewers.</p>
        <p>“Wow, Destroyer! Starry Cup has some class,” Many people could
            not help but praise when recognizing the Destroyer in the
            holographic image.</p>
        <p>“Hello friends. This is your host Fang Mingquan. From today, I
            will be covering Starry Cup - Blackhawk Division for you. I will
            broadcast the warframe items live…”</p>
        <p>The viewers who knew something about Starry Cup started to leave
            comments.</p>
        <p>“Fang, why don’t you broadcast Ouyang Xiaosan’s martial arts
            match?”</p>
        <p>“Why warframes? Blackhawk is just so-so in warframe items. Is
            there something shady going on here?”</p>
        <p>“Fang must be marginalized in the station.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Fang Mingquan saw these comments and smiled. “Thank you,
            friends, for your concern. The reason I chose to broadcast live all
            the warframe matches is that I think this year there will be a most
            valuable player from Blackhawk who will be a star in the entire
            Alliance. So, this show will focus on all his matches. In addition,
            this player is in all the items of warframe except for one due to a
            time conflict. Let us wait and see his performance.”</p>
        <p>“Really? A star in the entire Alliance?”</p>
        <p>“Last time he happened to be right and now he is trying his luck
            again. Nonsense. I graduated from Blackhawk and that school is
            lucky to be in the top 20 in warframe in the Alliance.”</p>
        <p>“Fang must be talking about the driver of the Destroyer?”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha, excited to see what will happen.”</p>
        <p>“Fang is so creative with his live show.”</p>
        <p>“Love you, Fang Mingquan.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Both the believers and nonbelievers gazed at the Destroyer.</p>
        <p>“I will tell you something about this player briefly. He is a
            freshman in Blackhawk and majors in archery. As a member of the
            school’s Heavy Warframe Society…”</p>
        <p>His introduction left the audience confused. Freshman, archery
            and Heavy Warframe Society seemed to have nothing to do with a most
            valuable player.</p>
        <p>“Fang Mingquan must be crazy,” thought Wang Changqing who was
            also watching this live show.</p>
