        <p>“This person must die.” Luo Tianyang suddenly had an urge to
            kill Han Sen and was about to raise his whip again. When he looked
            at Han Sen, however, he stopped and his whole body became
            tense.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had put away the broadsword and held Doomsday in his
            hands. Drawing the string to the fullest, he pointed the arrowhead
            at Luo Tianyang.</p>
        <p>Although Luo Tianyang did not recognize Doomsday, thanks to his
            rich experience of fighting, he could smell danger from Han Sen and
            his bow and stayed completely still.</p>
        <p>The two were into a deadlock—Luo Tianyang did not dare to move,
            and Han Sen did not have the confidence to kill Luo Tianyang with
            only one shot. Even time seemed to stand still.</p>
        <p>The onlookers were completely shocked. When Han Sen beat Liu
            Feng and his friends, they simply couldn’t believe it, and now he
            was even well-matched with Luo Tianyang?</p>
        <p>Luo Tianyang was one of Son of Heaven’s henchmen, his strength
            rating was near 10.0, and even he didn’t dare to move with Han
            Sen’s arrow pointed at him.</p>
        <p>Anyone with a strength rating of more than 9.0 would be among
            the top 100 in Steel Armor Shelter, where there were more than
            100,000 people. That someone like this could be scared by Han Sen
            was an overwhelming fact to all. No one knew how Han Sen could gain
            such strength when isolated by both Qin Xuan and Son of Heaven.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, put down your bow,” said Qin Xuan, leading her gang,
            who were all riding beast soul mounts.</p>
        <p>Han Sen put away his bow and arrow. His strength was still
            weaker than Luo Tianyang, and Han Sen was not sure if he could
            shoot his opponent when Luo had his guard up. Keeping the posture
            was consuming his energy very fast, and the deadlock was not good
            for Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Miss Qin, I’ll kill this bastard for you,” said Luo Tianyang,
            whipping at Han Sen, who had already disarmed himself.</p>
        <p>Han Sen seemed to be prepared for this and was about to block
            the whip with Doomsday. Before he acted, a beast soul bronze sword
            was thrown over and hit the whip. The strength of the throw was so
            fierce that the whip fell from Luo Tianyang’s hand.</p>
        <p>“I will discipline my guy, and you can mind your own business.”
            Qin Xuan looked at Luo Tianyang coldly and summoned back her sword
            before she rode into the shelter.</p>
        <p>“Follow me,” Qin Xuan turned back and commanded Han Sen.</p>
        <p>Han Sen quickly caught up with her and followed her gang into
            the shelter.</p>
        <p>The entire Steel Armor Shelter was suddenly in an uproar. Ass
            Freak beat Liu Feng and his friends, was well-matched against Luo
            Tianyang and was, most importantly, declared by Qin Xuan to be her
            guy. All the news had driven everyone mad.</p>
        <p>No one understood what had happened: it was all guesswork.</p>
        <p>“Did they develop a love affair from the stab?”</p>
        <p>“I have to learn from Ass Freak and stab a beautiful and capable
            woman in the ass. Maybe I can become rich and powerful.”</p>
        <p>“Qin Xuan looks so serious, but she is actually a flirt.”</p>
        <p>Rumors spread across the entire Steel Armor Shelter, and Han Sen
            was once again put under the spotlight.</p>
        <p>However, Han Sen’s strength was not really the focus. People
            cared more about whether he was Qin Xuan’s boy toy. Even Qin Xuan’s
            gang would look at Han Sen weirdly.</p>
        <p>“You know archery?” asked Qin Xuan after she called Han Sen to a
            hall.</p>
        <p>“I used to practice,” Han Sen shrugged.</p>
        <p>“You can use Doomsday, so you must’ve worked hard on it,” said
            Qin Xuan matter-of-factly. “You can join Bullseye and follow me in
            the future.”</p>
        <p>“No,” Han Sen refused.</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan bite her lips and said snappily, “You just offended Luo
            Tianyang. Without my protection, do you suppose he’d let you
            live?”</p>
        <p>“Thank you for your kindness, but I will deal with it myself,”
            Han Sen said indifferently.</p>
        <p>“You should have known who I am. My men are more or less related
            to the military, and Bullseye belongs to me. Follow me and you will
            gain great advantages when applying for military schools,” Qin Xuan
            suppressed her anger and said to Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“I never wanted to go to a military school.” Han Sen knew that
            he could apply to a military school for further education after he
            finished integrated compulsory education. However, all military
            schools had high requirements of fitness. If one’s fitness index
            was below 10 before the first evolution, one had no chance at
            military schools. For Han Sen, to reach 10 in the fitness index was
            not hard, but he wasn’t interested in going to school at all. He’d
            rather put more effort into hunting.</p>
        <p>Exasperated, Qin Xuan said, “Without education from military
            school and an aristocratic title, you could only be an ordinary
            soldier when you are of age to serve. Only through a military
            school can you become something in the army. At least by then you
            wouldn’t have been sacrificed.”</p>
