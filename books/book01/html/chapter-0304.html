<p>Zheng Chi and Zhou Qingyu were dumbstruck. They had never seen
someone so powerful.</p>
<p>“Incredible.” Seeing Han Sen killing the murky beast, Zheng Chi
couldn’t remove his stare from Han Sen.</p>
<p>The slaughter continued. The creatures were killed by Han Sen
one by one.</p>
<p>“He is becoming more and more awesome.” Gambler leaned against
the stone wall, lit a cigarette, and sighed.</p>
<p>“Gambler, has the captain always been so strong?” Zheng Chi
couldn’t help asking.</p>
<p>“What should I say… I used to teach him things…” Gambler inhaled
deeply and blew a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>“For real?” Both Zheng Chi and Zhou Qingyu widened their eyes
and could not believe that.</p>
<p>“Look at how he draws his weapon. You can’t even tell where the
weapon was hidden. This is called Sleeveblade, passed down in my
family. If Han Sen were not a genius in martial arts, I would never
have taught him my family secret. Luckily, he did not let me down…”
bragged Gambler, enjoying the worship in Zheng Chi and Zhou
Qingyu’s eyes.</p>
<p>Gambler would never admit that he only taught Han Sen
Sleeveblade for some dirty movies.</p>
<p>As Han Sen cleared his way, the golden rock worm king also
enjoyed a satisfying feast. Han Sen only saved the body of
sacred-blood murky beast by putting it on the back of the worm
king, who had consumed all the other preys of Han Sen’s.</p>
<p>There were an astonishing number of creatures in this nest, the
majority of which were mutant. Han Sen had killed nearly 100 mutant
creatures so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mutant Darkness Beast Killed. Beast Soul Of Mutant Darkness
Beast Gained. Eat Its Meat To Gain 0 To 10 Mutant Geno Points
Randomly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the third mutant beast soul that Han Sen had gained. And
he did not even bother to count how many primitive beast souls he
had.</p>
<p>The golden rock worm king only picked out the mutant creatures
for food. It did not even look at primitive or ordinary
creatures.</p>
<p>Even so, the golden rock worm king still started belching. It
was now as big as a minivan.</p>
<p>Eventually, Han Sen had come to the egg. Looking at the giant
egg, Han Sen slashed at it without hesitation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Identifying Beast Soul…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Han Sen cleared away the remaining creatures absent-mindedly,
he again witnessed the formation of a beast soul, which turned out
to be a long sword burning with black flames.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beast Soul Identified. Sacred-Blood Beast Soul Devil Sword
Gained.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others might celebrate this result, but Han Sen was slightly
disappointed. Despite that a sacred-blood beast soul was precious,
what Han Sen needed was a super beast soul.</p>
<p>Since he had come thus far, Han Sen decided to wipe clean all
the remaining creatures.</p>
<p>For once, the golden rock worm king could not eat anymore.
Although there were mutant creatures left, it stopped moving
around.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been feeding the worm king for a long time, but it
was the first time he had seen the worm king stopped eating, which
amazed Han Sen.</p>
<p>This worked for him as well, as he intended to save some mutant
creature meat to give Zheng Chi and Zhou Qingyu for their
effort.</p>
<p>As for Gambler, he had maxed out on mutant geno points a long
time ago, and was not really interested in the meat.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was fighting underground, Yang Manli who was
waiting outside became a bit worried. Since Han Sen had spent too
much time in the nest, she wanted to check on him and make sure he
was safe.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and have a look.” Yang Manli led people down the
nest.</p>
<p>The other people knew that Yang Manli was Han Sen’s deputy in
the special squad and did not doubt that she might be plotting
against him.</p>
<p>“Shall we go down as well? If something goes wrong, we can be of
some help,” said Yuan, leading the team to join Yang Manli.</p>
<p>Little Finger hesitated and also took a team member with him. He
had suffered quite some loss and did not dare to bring to many
people.</p>
<p>The group went under the nest and were shocked by what they
saw.</p>
<p>In the Giants nest, dead creatures were lying around. Almost the
entire nest was painted with blood. Under the light reflected by
the green gold, it looked strange and cruel.</p>
<p>"The four of them had killed all these creatures? " Qing widened
his eyes and asked.</p>
<p>“No one is here except for the four of them.” Little Finger was
also shocked and could not believe that the four of them could have
done such damage.</p>
<p>Little Finger thought that even if the entire Fist Gang were
here, they could not be so efficient.</p>
<p>“Incredible.” People in Steel Armor Gang were also
dumbstruck.</p>
<p>Stepping on the blood and dead bodies, they soon spotted Han
Sen, Gambler, Zheng Chi and Zhou Qingyu handling the bodies on the
ground. It seemed that they were trying to pick out all the mutant
creatures.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, in the entire shelter, you’re my only idle in addition
to Dollar.” Qing gave Han Sen a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>“Impressive, Han Sen,” said Little Finger with complex
feelings.</p>
<p>Yang Manli did not speak, but also had a mix of feelings. She
already had a high estimate of Han Sen’s ability, but still failed
to predict that he was able to wipe out the entire nest with his
team.</p>
<p>As a member of the special squad, Yang Manli knew that Zheng Chi
and Zhou Qingyu were not the strongest team members, so Gambler and
Han Sen must be the ones who really achieved this. However, Gambler
was good at playing tricks instead of fighting head on. Obviously,
Han Sen was the MVP here.</p>
<p>After the fight in the nest, Han Sen had gained a lot of
prestige in Steel Armor Shelter. Because everyone believed Dollar
who had not made his appearance in a long time had become an
evolver, Han Sen was now considered the number one in the
shelter.</p>
