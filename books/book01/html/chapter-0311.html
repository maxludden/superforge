        <p>Han Sen waved at his friends and entered the archery range. At
            the same time, Jing Jiya also entered the range.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, there is something that I should probably tell you
            beforehand,” Jing Jiya walked over to Han Sen and said with a
            smile.</p>
        <p>“If you want to tell me, then tell me,” said Han Sen
            casually.</p>
        <p>Jing Jiya smiled and said nothing. He walked to the bow rack,
            took a 16.0 practice bow and a quiver full of arrows, and returned
            to Han Sen.</p>
        <p>The next second, Jing Jiya straightened his back, nocked an
            arrow, and made a shot casually.</p>
        <p>That was only a start. He then quickly shot nine more arrows,
            between which there was almost no gap. The ten arrows were like a
            straight line, flying toward the target 60 feet away.</p>
        <p>Students were dumbstruck. If it was very hard to believe that
            with a 16.0 arrow, Jing Jiya was able to shoot a succession of ten
            arrows. His strength was beyond their imagination.</p>
        <p>“He is indeed even stronger than Jing Jiwu at his age,” mumbled
            Situ Xiang.</p>
        <p>Chen Ling was also amazed. Among the unevolved, very few people
            had this kind of strength, not to mention Jing Jiya was just a
            freshman.</p>
        <p>As people were shocked by what Jing Jiya could do, they found
            the bigger surprise was yet to come.</p>
        <p>As the first arrow hit the bull’s eye, the second arrow suddenly
            made a strange turn when it was about to hit the first, which was
            the same case with the remaining eight arrows.</p>
        <p>When all ten arrows were on the target, people found that only
            the first one hit the bull’s eye, while the other nine arrows
            formed a circle with the first arrow as the center.</p>
        <p>Everybody widened their mouth. Someone yelpped and said,
            “Spinning arrow! Isn’t that Han Sen’s spinning arrow? How come Jing
            Jiya can also do that?”</p>
        <p>At this point, even Situ Xiang cannot believe her eyes. Jing
            Jiya used a 16.0 bow to shoot a succession of ten arrows, nine of
            which were spinning. Judging from the way that the arrows were
            aligned she knew that Jing Jiya was already an archery master.</p>
        <p>“Monster! A monster more formidable than Jing Jiwu was!”
            lamented Situ Xiang. She had hoped that Han Sen would win, but did
            not have much faith after watching Jing Jiya’s performance.</p>
        <p>Han Sen’s most impressive skill was spinning arrow, with which
            he beat Jing Jiwu. However, Jing Jiya seemed to be even better at
            that, and he even had a higher fitness index than his older
            brother. There was simply no way that Han Sen could beat Jing
            Jiya.</p>
        <p>“Jing Jiya also knows spinning arrow, and it looks like he has
            mastered it. Han Sen is in trouble now.”</p>
        <p>“What great archery skills! I’m afraid Han Sen will not be
            better than him.”</p>
        <p>“Using a 16.0 bow at will, Jing Jiya is more formidable than
            Jing Jiwu was.”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>At this point, Shi Zhikang, Zhang Yang and Lu Meng all became
            pale. Shi Zhikang exclaimed, “How come this guy also knows Han
            Sen’s spinning arrow? I’ve heard that it is almost impossible for
            an unevolved person to do that.”</p>
        <p>“Almost, but not completely impossible. Jing Jiya and Han Sen
            are both exceptions,” said Lu Meng calmly, looking worried
            nonetheless.</p>
        <p>The crowd were in awe of Jing Jiya’s archery skills, and few
            people believed that Han Sen could still win.</p>
        <p>“What do you think my spinning arrow, brother?” Jing Jiya asked,
            amused.</p>
        <p>“Jing Jiya, it is quite impressive for your age. Good job!” said
            Han Sen in appreciation.</p>
        <p>He did appreciate what Jing Jiya could do. Although Jing Jiya
            had not practiced Yin Yang Blast, he managed to achieve the effect
            of the spinning arrow by practicing archery techniques alone.</p>
        <p>Hearing Han Sen’s words, Jing Jiya felt belittled. At your age?
            It sounded like he was a kid trying to impress his parents with a
            golden star awarded by school.</p>
        <p>“Since you said that, you must have stronger archery skills than
            I do. Why don’t you show us?” suggested Jing Jiya with his brows
            knitted.</p>
        <p>“No need. I don’t have much time. Let’s just get started with
            the duel.” Han Sen immediately went to the bow rack, picking up a
            bow and a quiver of arrows.</p>
        <p>The students were surprised by Han Sen’s choice of bow. He
            picked an 11.0 practice bow, which was too weak for any archery
            student. Anyone could easily use a bow like this.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen seems to be overly confident. How can he compete with
            Jing Jiya with an 11.0 bow?”</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute. The bow he used to beat Jing Jiwu was also an
            11.0 bow. Maybe he wants to do it again?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think it’s going to happen. Last time the victory was
            mainly because of the great tactics Coach Situ Xiang used. Also,
            Jing Jiwu did not know there was such a thing as spinning arrow and
            was taken by surprise. However, now Jing Jiya knows about the
            spinning arrow and is even better at it than Han Sen. How can Han
            Sen possibly win with an 11.0 bow?”</p>
        <p>“What is Sen trying to pull? He should have picked a strong bow
            in any case!” Shi Zhikang was stunned, trying to understand why Han
            Sen would have picked an 11.0 bow.</p>
        <p>Lu Meng did not speak, as he did not understand either.</p>
        <p>Nor did Zhang Yang. He looked at Wang Mengmeng and asked,
            “Mengmeng, didn’t you use to learn archery skills from Han Sen?
            Tell us, what is he trying to do?”</p>
        <p>Wang Mengmeng pondered and answered, “Brother Han must feel that
            it is too easy to beat Jing Jiya anyway, so he picked the first bow
            he saw. I don’t believe it means anything.”</p>
