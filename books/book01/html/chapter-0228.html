        <p>Although Situ Qing was the top among all evolvers and was about
            to become a surpasser, it did not necessarily mean that he was
            better at black and white boxing.</p>
        <p>Black and white boxing did not have much to do with strength or
            speed. What was important was the control of one’s body, judgement
            and state of mind.</p>
        <p>Because Han Sen had practiced Jadeskin, the control he had over
            his own body and strength was not worse than an evolver, and the
            other two factors had nothing to do with status.</p>
        <p>Han Sen had just started to practice Yin Yang Blast, and he was
            very much inspired by its theoretical knowledge.</p>
        <p>Bai Yishan was right in that it was not dangerous to practice
            and also helpful to increase his fitness.</p>
        <p>The danger of Yin Yang Blast was in its usage.</p>
        <p>Using the yin force and yang force at the right moment was
            extremely challenging for the users. If a mistake was made, the
            users themselves would be hurt instead.</p>
        <p>The yin force was a soft force, while the yang force was
            domineering. They were two extremes in essence.</p>
        <p>Similar to black and white boxing, it was demanding for the
            user’s judgement. You had to be able to tell what kind of strength
            your opponent was using to decide whether to use yin blast or yang
            blast.</p>
        <p>If the opponent’s strength was greater than you, you needed to
            use the yin force. If you used the yang force, then it would be
            like hitting a stone with an egg.</p>
        <p>Because the yang force would consume all one’s strength, a
            strike normally meant either life or death.</p>
        <p>Of course, this was the most straightforward example. The usage
            of the forces could be very different. Combining the yin force and
            the yang force would allow one to cope with different situations,
            which was the hardest part of Yin Yang Blast.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a great part of Yin Yang Blast was dealing with the
            judgement of all kinds of situations and the methods to hide the
            user’s intentions.</p>
        <p>The usage of the yin force and the yang force needed lots of
            practice, so Han Sen was not able to use them at this point.
            However, he had already benefited a lot from the theories.</p>
        <p>And the theoretical knowledge went beyond the level of the
            unevolved and went all the way to the level of evolver and
            surpasser. As for the demigod level, Bai Yishan himself had not
            even reached that, so there was no relevant introduction.</p>
        <p>Even so, Han Sen was able to understand the theories from a high
            level.</p>
        <p>When he used this theoretical knowledge on Situ Qing, the effect
            was beyond his expectation.</p>
        <p>Situ Qing’s expression gradually changed. Originally he wanted
            to instruct Han Sen, while later on he started to treat him like a
            serious match. In the end, Situ Qing was extremely shocked.</p>
        <p>“How did you manage to do that?” Situ Qing stared at Han Sen. He
            was not able to win a single round in a dozen matches. Situ Qing
            suspected that the student might have cheating equipment on
            him.</p>
        <p>“That was easy. The way you use your strength was outdated. For
            example, when you use the black fist, the muscle on your arm…” Han
            Sen said something in the theories of the Yin Yang Blast.</p>
        <p>Situ Qing nodded hard, looking like a primary school student
            listening to his teacher.</p>
        <p>“Ahem… I’m sorry. I’ve said too much. I should go back to do the
            horse-riding stance.”</p>
        <p>Situ Qing stopped him and put Han Sen in his own chair. Pouring
            Han Sen a cup of tea, the coach put a smile on his face, “Forget
            about that. Please continue.”</p>
        <p>“That doesn’t seem to be right,” Han Sen blinked and said.</p>
        <p>“What’s not right? I have watched your test videos. You are
            doing great. I will show you some tricks later and you just need to
            practice them.” Situ Qing suggested, “Let’s do this—you can show me
            how to improve black and white boxing skills, and I can show you
            archery techniques. If you have anything that you don’t understand,
            you could always ask me about it.”</p>
        <p>“Then I’ll continue?” asked Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Please,” insisted Situ Qing.</p>
        <p>Han Sen grinned and continued to talk about black and white
            boxing, while Situ Qing took up the bow and arrow to show Han Sen
            some special archery techniques.</p>
        <p>“Don’t stop.” Han Sen urged Situ Qing, he found that the coach
            had stopped demonstrating as he listened to Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Yes… Yes…” Situ Qing said and continued to shoot the
            arrows.</p>
        <p>After two days, Situ Xiang felt it was about time to check on
            Han Sen. She would go see how miserable he was and the try to make
            him join the team proactively.</p>
        <p>Imagining the look on Han Sen’s face, Situ Xiang couldn’t help
            smiling and quickening her steps.</p>
        <p>The moment she stepped in the training facility, what she saw
            made her pause.</p>
        <p>Opposite to her imagination, the popular student was even
            sitting in her father’s chair, drinking a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Her dad, on the other hand, was shooting arrows next to Han Sen,
            smiling to the student from time to time. It was as if Situ Qing
            was the one under training and Han Sen was the coach. Situ Xiang
            was dumbstruck and thought there was something wrong with her
            eyes.</p>
        <p>“Why?” Situ Xiang could not even close her mouth.</p>
        <p>How come her dad who was called “the Nazi” was acting like this?
            What spell did Han Sen cast on him?</p>
        <p>She could not accept what she was seeing and thought she was in
            the dream.</p>
        <p>“This must be a dream. My dad could not…” Situ Xiang pinched her
            own cheek, trying to wake up.</p>
        <p>“Ouch!” The acute pain on her cheek confirmed that she was not
            in a dream. Covering her face, Situ Xiang had an odd look on her
            face.</p>
