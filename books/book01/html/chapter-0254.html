<p>“I was just wondering why they both chose archery. It turns out
that there’s something going on between the two!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! I can’t wait to see their duel.”</p>
<p>“Monster and Emperor, very interesting. I believe Han Sen’s
black and white boxing ID is Emperor.”</p>
<p>“I have seen Han Sen’s black and white boxing competition. He
even beat Nalan Chengnuo 5 to 0 and Jing Jiwu only beat Nalan
Chengnuo 3 to 2.”</p>
<p>“Must be a great show.”</p>
<p>“So exciting!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Alliance Central Military Academy won their first round
without any suspense.</p>
<p>However, the team did not leave after the game, but changed
outfits and sat on the stands to watch other teams games, giving
more evidence to those who were speculating about the relationship
between Han Sen and Jing Jiwu.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu became super excited and focused her camera on Jing
Jiwu and Han Sen instead of the game itself.</p>
<p>The viewers of the game were also in a heated discussion.
Eventually, it was Blackhawk' s turn. Their opponent was Smith
military Academy.</p>
<p>People were guessing who Situ Xiang would pick to represent
Blackhawk and were surprised by the result. Except for Xu Tianhao
was the old Capt., the other four teammates were the four freshmen
from room 304.</p>
<p>Shi Zhikang was so surprised that he open his mouth wide. He did
not expect to be able to represent the school. His level was only
average and even slightly worse than those old team members.</p>
<p>As for Lu Meng and Zhang Yang, they had been performing at top
levels in the school team, so that it made sense the coach picked
them.</p>
<p>“Carry on. I believe in you.” Situ Xiang smiled and patted Shi
Zhikang on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Like Lu Meng had predicted, Situ Xiang was someone who valued
morale very much. She would rather take Shi Zhikang than those who
had lost their confidence.</p>
<p>If the old captain Xu Tianhao did not have faith, Situ Xiang
might even replace him as well.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll be here for you,” Zhang Yang patted Shi
Zhikang and said.</p>
<p>Shi Zhikang immediately exclaimed, “What’s to be worried about?
This round we don’t even have to face the monster. Even in the next
round, Han Sen will win it for us.”</p>
<p>Lu Meng and Zhang Yang through a contemptuous look at Shi
Zhikang and went back to training.</p>
<p>The team competition was a playoff system. Each group had five
members. In the venue full of obstacles, the team that outed all
five members of the other group would win. It was almost like a
shootout, only with arrows. The arrows used in the game were
flat-headed magnetic ones. Once the arrow hit a player, the person
would be out immediately.</p>
<p>In the show hosted by Wen Xiuxiu, a famous archery expert Feng
Jiulun was invited to analyze the game.</p>
<p>“Professor Feng Jiulun, could you make an analysis of the
current situation of the two teams?” Wen Xiuxiu asked Feng
Jiulun.</p>
<p>Although Wen Xiuxiu did not know much about archery before, she
did her homework before she came and now knew quite a lot about the
rules and the teams.</p>
<p>Smith military Academy was on the same level as Blackhawk. Last
year, Smith military Academy did not do that well in archery
either, only slightly better than Blackhawk.</p>
<p>This year, Smith Military Academy also recruited many archery
students, among whom Fang Wending was one of the top.</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun cleared his throat and said lightly, “Blackhawk and
Smith are on the same level and I will say it’s a 60% chance of
winning.”</p>
<p>“You think Blackhawk only has a 60% chance of winning?” asked
Wen Xiuxiu, surprised.</p>
<p>“No, I believe Smith has 60% chance of winning,” said Feng
Jiulun casually.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu was a bit dumbstruck. Everyone knew that Han Sen was
the player that Jing Jiwu took very seriously, so she did not
expect Feng to say that.</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun did not wait for another question before he
continued, “I know that there is a lot of hype on the Skynet about
Han Sen and Jing Jiwu. However, as a professional archery analyst,
I could tell you that it is just a PR stunt. Han Sen and Blackhawk
did not have what it takes to be the Alliance Central military
Academy’s match. I would say that it would be hard for them even to
beat Smith.”</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun’s remark led to fury of the viewers.</p>
<p>“What kind of expert is this? What’s all this bull crap?”</p>
<p>“My Emperor is hand-picked by Jing Jiwu. Smith is nothing.”</p>
<p>“Where does the so-called expert come from?”</p>
<p>“PR stunt my ass.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Both Jing Jiwu’s fans and Han Sen’s fans voiced their
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Although Wen Xiuxiu felt embarrassed, she could not discredit an
expert on her own show. She had to say, “There must be a reason why
you support Smith?”</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun smiled and said, “As an expert, I would not be
easily affected by public opinion. To the contrary, I value data.
The reason that I say Smith has a better chance at winning is that
through scientific analysis, Blackhawk is nowhere near Smith. I do
not need to make a judgment, only an interpretation of the numbers.
Although the public are misled by the PR stunt and fake news, that
does not change the fact that Blackhawk is a weak team.”</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu was mortified at this point. One of the fake news
Feng Jiulun talked about was her article.</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun, on the other hand, did not know that Wen Xiuxiu had
written such a report. The reason he made such an analysis was that
Fang Wending was Feng Jiulun’s nephew. Feng Jiulun knew that Fang
Wending’s parents were professional archers and that Fang Wending
had really good skills, so he utilized this opportunity to brag
about his own wonderful analytical skills and gain his nephew some
popularity.</p>
