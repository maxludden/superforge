        <h3>Chapter 81</h3>
        <figure><img src="../Images/gem.gif" alt="gem" id="gem" width="120" height="60" /></figure>
        <p>The scripture of Jadeskin opened with these words, “Jade skin
            and flawless body, evils away and spells vain.”</p>
        <p>When he sipped the water, Han Sen knew something was wrong, but
            he still drank it without hesitation.</p>
        <p>Hearing a humming, Han Sen felt like his mind and eyes were
            sucked into Qin Xuan’s eyes and the he almost lost his
            consciousness.</p>
        <p>Almost at the same time, a coolness welled from his limbs.
            Jadeskin started to run in his body automatically and the coolness
            restored his senses.</p>
        <p>“This woman wants to hypnotize me. What’s she trying to do?” Han
            Sen sneered inwardly, but didn’t show anything on his face. He
            maintained that confused look.</p>
        <p>“Han Sen, are my eyes not pretty?” Qin Xuan asked.</p>
        <p>“They are pretty,” Han Sen answered in a low voice.</p>
        <p>“Which part of my body do you like best?” Qin Xuan asked
            again.</p>
        <p>“Your boobs,” Han Sen did not hesitate to answer.</p>
        <p>“Why?” Qin Xuan asked again.</p>
        <p>“They are big, soft and bouncy,” Han Sen replied.</p>
        <p>“Nasty!” Qin Xuan whispered. When they were in the combat room,
            Han Sen must have touched her boobs when they fought.</p>
        <p>“Come and touch them,” Qin Xuan said, lifting her chest.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not hesitate to reach out his hands and Qin Xuan
            suddenly pushed his hands aside. Now she could confirm that Han Sen
            had been completely hypnotized by her, as any normal person would
            hesitate when hearing such an odd request, which Han Sen did
            not.</p>
        <p>“Are you Dollar?” Qin Xuan’s first question scared the hell out
            of him.</p>
        <p>Han Sen didn’t realize Qin Xuan had connected some dots. Without
            time to think any further, he answered, “No.”</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan nodded, apparently not believing the two were the same
            person herself. She continued to ask, “Why are you unwilling to go
            to Blackhawk?”</p>
        <p>“Because it was too far away from home,” Han Sen replied.</p>
        <p>“How is that relevant?” Qin Xuan did not understand his
            logic.</p>
        <p>“I wouldn’t be able to take care of my mom and my sister if it
            is too far away from home,” Han Sen replied slowly.</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan was a bit surprised and then her look softened. She
            asked, “Have you ever considered to join my squad?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“Why?” Qin Xuan was slightly angry.</p>
        <p>“I’m afraid of danger. I cannot die,” replied Han Sen.</p>
        <p>“Why can’t you die?” Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen, finding his
            reply curious.</p>
        <p>“If I die, my mom and my sister will be bullied by my relatives,
            and I cannot let them be bullied,” Han Sen continued to answer.</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan’s expression became more and more gentle, and she
            continued to ask, “Why did you agree to join Bullseye?”</p>
        <p>“Because of you.”</p>
        <p>“Me?” Qin Xuan was confused.</p>
        <p>“Because I like you.” Han Sen still had a dull face on.</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan blushed a little, “Why do you like me?”</p>
        <p>“Because you are beautiful.”</p>
        <p>“Is there any other reason?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“What reason?” Surprisingly, Qin Xuan was slightly excited to
            hear the answer.</p>
        <p>“Because you are beautiful.”</p>
        <p>“Isn’t this the same reason?” Qin Xuan frowned.</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“Why not?” Qin Xuan looked at Han Sen, puzzled.</p>
        <p>“Because the first time I saw you, I thought you are beautiful;
            the second time I saw you, you are more beautiful. I can’t move
            away my eyes and want to look at you forever…”</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan’s cheeks turned crimson. She raised her arm and wanted
            to slap Han Sen out of it, but eventually didn’t have the heart to
            do that and just gave him a pinch swiftly.</p>
        <p>Han Sen fell to the ground suddenly with an “ouch,” acting as if
            he had fallen under the bed in sleep.</p>
        <p>Qin Xuan subconsciously reached out her hand, but took it back
            and let Han Sen fall to the ground as she blushed at certain
            thoughts.</p>
        <p>“What did you do to me?” Han Sen suddenly climbed up from the
            ground and pretended to be frightened.</p>
        <p>“You do not have to worry, I just wanted to know why you do not
            want to go to Blackhawk.” Qin Xuan said softly.</p>
        <p>“You hypnotized me?” Han Sen was raged.</p>
        <p>“One must go through this process to join the squad. The people
            we serve are special, so we must guarantee that every member had a
            clean slate. I myself had to go through the same thing.” Qin Xuan
            looked at Han Sen and said gently, “You can rest assured that your
            family will be protected by the military once you go to Blackhawk
            and join my squad. No one could hurt them.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen looked uncertain and remained silent.</p>
        <p>“Also, I can tell you that each shelter has the same kind of
            squad, providing service for special clients. This job wouldn’t put
            you in great danger. And that’s everything I can tell you. You can
            think about it yourself.”</p>
        <p>Not hearing an answer, Qin Xuan had to ask, “What do you think?
            Do you want to join my squad?”</p>
        <p>“Do I still have an option?” Han Sen said with a wry smile.</p>
        <p>“Try to be admitted to the Blackhawk. After joining my squad,
            you will be glad about your decision today.” Qin Xuan patted Han
            Sen’s shoulder, pleased.</p>
        <p>“Oh, if you need anything just let me know. I’ll try to assist
            you so that you could prepare for the entrance exam of Blackhawk,”
            Qin Xuan said.</p>
        <p>“I just want to know one thing. When I was hypnotized, did you
            ask me any other question other than why I wasn’t interested in
            Blackhawk?” Han Sen asked.</p>
        <p>“No, I am a well-behaved soldier. And I am not interested in
            your private matters,” Qin Xuan said categorically, with her heart
            pounding as if there were a cat scratching at it.</p>
        <p>“Really?” Han Sen seemed to be worried still.</p>
        <p>“Of course not. Let me know if you need anything. As long as it
            doesn’t cost too much, I will help you prepare for the exam, which
            is in less than two months,” Qin Xuan side said and left, her face
            burning.</p>
        <p>After Qin Xuan left, Han Sen let out a long sigh of relief. From
            now on, Qin Xuan probably wouldn’t suspect him again.</p>
        <p>“This is an excellent opportunity. Qin Xuan would completely
            trust me after this so she can become my cover. Others would think
            I got stronger and better because of her help and wouldn’t suspect
            that I am Dollar. Then, I could gradually show my real ability
            using my own identity and abandon the guise of Dollar altogether,”
            Han Sen thought to himself. This was why he had agreed to Qin
            Xuan’s ask. Also, his family could indeed use the protection of the
            military.</p>
        <p>Han Sen then teleported into God’s Sanctuary as it was Dollar’s
            time to participate in the second round of the martial arts
            contest.</p>
