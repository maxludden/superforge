<p>Lu Weinan was indeed great at escaping. Using his incredible
footwork, he was able to take back his hand and run from the
tiger.</p>
<p>Meowth had already thrown itself at Lu Weinan and was ready to
launch another attack.</p>
<p>“Meowth, come back to eat.” Han Sen called. He was counting on
Lu Weinan to lead the way and did not want him to be killed.</p>
<p>Lu Weinan pointed at Meowth and shouted, “Isn’t it mutant beast
soul pet? How come…”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not reply and continued to eat. Lu Weinan suddenly
understood, “It evolved!”</p>
<p>Lu Weinan shot an envious glance at Meowth, and said, “Brother,
you are so lucky. Even your mutant pet has evolved. Now it must be
more valuable than any other sacred-blood beast soul.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was lucky.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought to himself, “If you see holy angel, you would
know what a truly valuable pet looks like.”</p>
<p>Thinking of holy angel, Han Sen was a little upset. He had tried
to feed her mutant meat, and she would not even look at it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was eating sacred-blood meat, she became very
interested. Unfortunately, Han Sen couldn’t afford to feed her
sacred-blood meat yet.</p>
<p>After the two persons and one cat were fed, they continued their
trip. Because the centipede was too large, Han Sen was not able to
gain a single mutant geno point with his full meal.</p>
<p>After flying for several days in the Dark Swamp, they reached
the destination. Unfortunately, all the mutant creatures they saw
were too large, and Han Sen only gained one mutant geno point.</p>
<p>They were at a water meadow. In the green grass stood a unicorn
horse, on the back of which sat a knight covered in shiny black
armor, with the black spear in his hand.</p>
<p>Only by looking at it from afar, Han Sen was certain that it was
not a human being, like Lu Weinan had said.</p>
<p>The armor of the knight’s was neither metal nor stone, it was
more like shell of the turtle or some kind of beetle. And there was
no gap between the parts of the armor.</p>
<p>It was very odd. Han Sen was sure that this was a sacred-blood
creature, and one that was very hard to deal with.</p>
<p>It was much stronger than the stone man that Helen showed him.
Just by looking at its spear and mount, Han Sen was sure that it
was not an ordinary sacred-blood creature.</p>
<p>Humanoid creatures were already very strong, and this one even
had a mount, which was something that Han Sen had not even heard of
before.</p>
<p>“Brother, am I right? Is it a sacred-blood creature?” Hiding in
the grass, Lu Weinan whispered to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is indeed a sacred-blood creature. However, it looks
very strong and I am not very confident that I could take care of
it.” Han Sen told him the truth.</p>
<p>The sacred-blood creature was so strange. Han Sen did not think
it would be weaker than the holy angel from the mystery Island.
However, he did not have a second sacred-blood ghost butterfly at
this point.</p>
<p>Luckily, he had the diamond sword. Even if this creature was as
strong as holy angel, he would still stand a chance.</p>
<p>“Brother, I’ll let you decide how to divide our gains.” Lu
Weinan thought Han Sen was expressing his dissatisfaction with his
proposal and added.</p>
<p>“I am afraid that the two of us will not be able to beat it.”
Han Sen believed that the black unicorn horse must have some
special functions other than just a mount.</p>
<p>Lu Weinan was very positive and said, “we have to try first.
This kind of rare sacred-blood creature must be worth a lot of
money. If we happen to get its beast soul, then we will be able to
make a fortune.”</p>
<p>“All right. So, let’s talk about how to divide our gains first.
I’m afraid that your proposal will not do,” said Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What do you suggest?” Lu Weinan looked at Han Sen and said
carefully.</p>
<p>“Since you have provided the information, you could take 20% of
our profits. The remaining 80% will be divided according to our
contribution in the hunting. What do you think?” Han Sen thought
about it and suggested.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Lu Weinan agreed to Han Sen’s terms. This way, he could
at least get 20%, while the large gangs would probably only give
him a 10% cut.</p>
<p>Also, if Lu Weinan made some contribution, he could get more. Lu
Weinan had wanted to make some effort originally, because he might
be able to gain the beast soul if he had a chance to make the last
attack.</p>
<p>After the two had finished the discussion, they sneaked up on
the sacred-blood creature hidden in grass. Han Sen thought, no
matter how strong the sacred-blood creature was, as long as it
could not fly, it will not be too risky for the two of them.</p>
<p>When they were 500 feet from the sacred-blood creature, it
suddenly looked to their direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw very clear that behind the helmet of the
sacred-blood creature were a pair of red eyes, as red as the flames
in the hell.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen and Lu Weinan could react, the sacred-blood
creature quickly urged the black unicorn horse to charge them and
raised his black spear.</p>
<p>“Watch out! This guy is too strong.” Han Sen grabbed the diamond
sword with both his hands and used Jadeskin to its full.</p>
<p>The unicorn horse had an incredible speed. It could also float
above the water and did not sink.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, the sacred-blood creature was merely a dozen
feet from Han Sen. With its high speed, it quickly used its spear
to stab Han Sen in the chest.</p>
