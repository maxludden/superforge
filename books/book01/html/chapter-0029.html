        <p>"Sen, you are so fit! You must have maxed out on mutant geno
            points. " Lin Beifeng stopped climbing as he felt his arms hurting
            too much, while Han Sen was still climbing briskly.</p>
        <p>“Hang in there. There is a rock sticking out up there, and we
            can go there and rest.” Han Sen looked down at Lin Beifeng.</p>
        <p>“Sen, I can’t. Shall we just go back down?”</p>
        <p>“You stay here. I will go up first and then pull you up with the
            vine.” Han Sen started to climb with all fours, and he was so fast
            it looked like he was walking on the ground, which stunned Lin
            Beifeng.</p>
        <p>It took a little while for Han Sen to reach the rock and use the
            vine to pull Lin Beifeng up. The rock was the size of a table. The
            two huddled on the rock and looked around. The cliff was so steep
            and there was no way to climb if it wasn’t for the vines, which
            only covered a part of the cliff.</p>
        <p>“Sen, let’s stay here for two days and maybe the mammo beasts
            will leave if they don’t see us. The cliff is so steep and I’m not
            as fit as you. I really can’t go up,” Lin Beifeng said
            anxiously.</p>
        <p>“Well, you just rest here, and I’ll go see if there is a way
            out. If there is, I’ll come back for you. If not then we could just
            wait for the mammo beasts to leave,” Han Sen said and got up to
            climb.</p>
        <p>“Sen, you will not abandon me?” Lin Beifeng grabbed Han Sen’s
            clothes like a little girl.</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry. How can I abandon you when you owe me so much
            money?” Han Sen patted Lin Beifeng on the shoulder and climbed
            away.</p>
        <p>Because he had practiced Ghosthaunt, Han Sen was particularly
            good at climbing. As he was much stronger now, it wasn’t too hard
            for him either.</p>
        <p>Han Sen climbed for a few hundred feet and still saw nothing but
            the cliff. The vines continued to go up, and he was wondering where
            their roots were.</p>
        <p>Han Sen felt a little tired and was thinking about going down.
            But with another look, he felt like there was a rock sticking out
            above him.</p>
        <p>“I’ll climb up to the rock above and have a look. If there is no
            way out, I’ll just go down to eat and drink. Maybe we could outrun
            the mammo beasts,” Han Sen decided, and kept climbing.</p>
        <p>The stone was farther and larger than Han Sen had imagined. It
            was half the size of a basketball court. When he got on the stone,
            Han Sen’s eyes suddenly widened.</p>
        <p>On the stone was a nest made with tree limbs and vines. It
            looked like a huge swallow’s nest, almost taking up a better half
            of the stone. An egg at least three feet tall lay in the nest.</p>
        <p>“Wow, such a big egg! How big would the creature that laid it
            be?” Han Sen shuddered. The creature was not here now, but he dared
            not think what would happen if it came back.</p>
        <p>Being big did not necessarily means it was advanced. Mammo
            beasts were huge but merely primitive creatures.</p>
        <p>However, the ability to make a nest and lay an egg on the cliff
            proved the creature was no average creature. It could very likely
            be a sacred-blood creature.</p>
        <p>If the egg belonged to a sacred-blood creature, Han Sen would
            not want to miss it.</p>
        <p>After some hesitation, Han Sen approached the egg and cut a hole
            in the egg shell with the tip of his dagger. Fishing out a straw
            from his pocket, he stuck it in the hole and started sucking.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the sweet juice filled Han Sen’s mouth.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Sacred-blood Creature Stormbird’s Egg Eaten. No Sacred Geno
                Point Gained.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Although no sacred-blood geno point was gained, the fact that
            the egg was indeed a sacred-blood creature left Han Sen in joy.</p>
        <p>It was such a huge egg, with at most only ten sacred geno
            points, that he was not surprised that he hadn’t gained a point
            with just a mouthful. And he already had some sacred geno points
            and couldn’t have all ten points, so he could only get six or seven
            if he was lucky.</p>
        <p>But sacred geno points were so hard to get that even just a few
            more would help.</p>
        <p>Han Sen was desperately sucking the liquid with the straw that
            he used to drink from his water bag when he was hiding from the
            creatures that he didn’t have to move. It was unexpectedly handy as
            well for sucking the egg juice.</p>
        <p>The egg was so big that when Han Sen finally heard the cue that
            he was gaining one sacred geno point, he was so full that he could
            drink no more. Han Sen pulled out the straw, and then sealed the
            hole with mud. Putting the straw back, he descended using the
            vine.</p>
        <p>“Sen, what took you so long? Is there a way out?” Seeing Han Sen
            coming from above, Lin Beifeng, who had been worried sick, asked
            immediately in a low voice so as not to alert the mammo beasts
            below.</p>
        <p>“No. It is as steep as a mirror, and we have nowhere to go.” Han
            Sen shook his head.</p>
        <p>“Then we have no option but to wait for the herd to leave,” Lin
            Beifeng said disappointedly.</p>
        <p>“It’s alright. We still have some food and water left.” Han Sen
            was really taking his time now as he couldn’t finish drinking the
            raw egg any time soon, and he wouldn’t leave before that.</p>
        <p>They huddled on the stone to spend the night, and the next
            morning Han Sen climbed up to eat more egg. He made sure there was
            no creature in the nest before he went up and broke the seal to
            drink from the egg.</p>
        <p>“Sen, why are you climbing up again?” Lin Beifeng wondered when
            Han Sen came down.</p>
        <p>“There are sacred-blood creatures above, and I was having a
            feast up there. Do you want to go together?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
        <p>“You can keep it.” Lin Beifeng glanced at him and didn’t believe
            a word he said. Even if there really were sacred-blood creatures,
            Han Sen was more likely to be their food.</p>
