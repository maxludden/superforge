        <p>Han Sen was somewhat surprised to see Han Hao sputtering on. He
            did not know Han Hao was also randomly sent to the Steel Armor
            Shelter.</p>
        <p>Han Hao was three months younger than him, so he should’ve just
            had his birthday and gained access to God’s Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>For unknown reasons, if those under 16 were teleported, their
            bodies would suffer irreversible damage. So according to the
            Alliance laws, one must be 16 years old to be teleported to God’s
            Sanctuary, regardless of social status.</p>
        <p>“Hey Frenzy, where are we going?” Han Sen asked Zhang Danfeng.
            Although Zhang Danfeng was a good-looking man, he became crazy
            whenever he was in a fight, hence the nickname.</p>
        <p>Zhang Danfeng’s face lit up, “Starlight Martial Hall. My idol
            Tang Zhenliu’s going to be in an exhibition fight held there! He
            was the Chosen last year, and his broadsword skills are so
            fierce!”</p>
        <p>Zhang Danfeng was full of yearning. In this era where everyone
            was focused on evolution, stars no longer came from acting,
            singing, sports and E-sports, but from fighting.</p>
        <p>In God’s Sanctuary, once every year the martial hall of each
            shelter would open at the same time, and those in the top 100 could
            have their names on the martial stele in the martial hall. The
            champions from each shelter would be eligible to compete among
            themselves. And the same happened in all four phases of God’s
            Sanctuary. The top 10 from each phase could have their names on the
            Sacred Stele, which was public to everyone in the same phase, and
            gain the title “the Chosen.”</p>
        <p>And the ten Chosen would become the hottest stars of the
            year.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Qin Xuan had always been the champion of Steel
            Armor Shelter, but her name was never on the Sacred Stele, so she
            was never among the top 10 of First God’s Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Ranking number 5 last year, Tang Zhenliu was known for his
            fierce broadsword skills. He was very popular among young people
            and even more well-liked than the top 4. He was paid as high as ten
            million Levo dollars for any exhibition match.</p>
        <p>Knowing his popularity, Han Sen was nevertheless shocked when he
            saw a full house at Starlight Martial Hall, which could accommodate
            more than a hundred thousand people.</p>
        <p>Many crazy fans were holding signs and calling out Tang
            Zhenliu’s name. When he appeared, a girl was so excited that she
            fainted.</p>
        <p>“If I could have my name on the Sacred Stele like Tang Zhenliu
            once in my life, then I’d know I’ve lived.” Zhang Danfeng said
            admiringly.</p>
        <p>“You will Frenzy.” Han Sen smiled and said, watching the young
            people around him going crazy for Tang Zhenliu’s appearance.</p>
        <p>“It’s so hard. I have entered God’s Sanctuary for three months
            already. Although I bought some primitive flesh and a primitive
            beast soul, it’s still difficult for me hunt any mutant creatures.
            If I could buy a mutant beast soul, it would be much easier. But
            even if I had the money, people wouldn’t necessarily sell their
            mutant beast souls.” Zhang Danfeng shook his head with a wry
            smile.</p>
        <p>Han Sen thought to himself regretfully, “The only thing that
            could be brought from God’s Sanctuary to the real world was a beast
            soul, while it can only be used but not traded there. Otherwise I
            could produce mutant creatures and would gain some mutant beast
            souls eventually, which could be really helpful to Frenzy.”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha, then I have better luck then you, Danfeng. I just
            entered God’s Sanctuary and have already gained a mutant beast
            soul. Such a pity you are not in Steel Armor Shelter, or else we
            could hunt together and I could help you,” Han Hao said
            proudly.</p>
        <p>"You’ve gained a mutant beast soul already? Tell the truth, did
            you hunt it or pay for it? " Zhang Danfeng cried, staring at Han
            Hao.</p>
        <p>“Of course I hunted it myself,” Han Hao said loudly.</p>
        <p>Han Sen laughed to himself. Since he was a kid, Han Hao had
            always raised his voice when he lied. His parents probably bought
            him the mutant beast soul with an enormous amount of money.</p>
        <p>The cheapest mutant beast soul would cost millions, and good
            ones tens of millions. So that’s why his relatives were after the
            old house. It was a huge expense for them. Although the company had
            earned a lot of money, they had probably spent it all by now.</p>
        <p>Tang Zhenliu was indeed awesome. Although it was just an
            exhibition fight, his broadsword skills were so swift and fierce
            that his broadsword almost became invisible.</p>
        <p>After watching for a while, Han Sen knew that Tang Zhenliu must
            have practiced premium hyper geno arts and learned his weapon
            skills from masters, and he was no competition to Tang Zhenliu.</p>
        <p>Tang Zhenliu won the fight and summoned a beast soul to perform,
            shapeshifting into a three-meter-tall tyrannosaurus creature and
            smashing a huge stone with its head, arousing a burst of
            screaming.</p>
        <p>“Sacred-blood beast soul of raging dementor! I would do anything
            for a beast soul like this.” Zhang Danfeng stared at Tang Zhenliu,
            who turned into a monster with a watering mouth.</p>
        <p>“This is nothing! This beat soul is nothing like the one Dollar
            has…” Han Hao sputtered about Dollar as if it were himself.</p>
        <p>“It would take a showdown to tell.” Tang Zhenliu was Danfeng’s
            idol, so he was upset to hear that. “I don’t know how good Dollar
            was, but his sacred-blood beast soul was robbed from others, and it
            was not a chivalric act. Even if he had a great beast soul, he
            would not be comparable to Zhenliu.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen blushed with shame and thought, “Oh Frenzy, you didn’t
            know what a hard time I was having! How could I let go of an
            opportunity like that! Not to mention Son of Heaven was my
            enemy.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen was hesitating whether or not to tell them that Dollar
            was himself but decided not to. It wouldn’t do them any good, after
            all.</p>
