<h2>Beast Soul Add-On</h2>
<h3>Chapter 305</h3>

<p>Han Hao was quite upset. He could not understand, for the love
of God, why Han Sen, who was the pariah in Steel Armor Shelter, had
become a military school student, a movie star in a commercial, and
now the number one in the shelter.</p>
<p>The Disciples and the Fist Gang both respected Han Sen a lot.
Even their leaders called Han Sen brother. Han Hao had also heard
that Yang Manli, who was leading the Steel Armor Gang, turned out
to be Han Sen’s deputy.</p>
<p>At this point, Han Hao started to regret what he used to do. Had
he maintained a better relationship with his cousin, he would have
done much better.</p>
<p>Han Hao did not even know when he could max out on his mutant
Geno points. Struggling alone in the shelter is so difficult. And
the Son of Heaven Gang that he depended on was getting weaker and
weaker, making it impossible for him to catch up.</p>
<p>“You can’t imagine how fierce Han Sen was. He only had three
people with him and they wiped clean the entire nest that none of
the gangs were able to tackle…”</p>
<p>Hearing the discussion of Han Sen’s bravery, Han Hao felt worse
and quickly went back to his own room.</p>
<p>At this time, Han Sen was appreciating his newly gained
sacred-blood beast soul devil sword.</p>

<!-- Type of beast soul of sacred-blood devil sword: sword add-on. --></div>
<p>Han Sen had seen an add-on beast soul before, which was the
sacred-blood water spirit beast soul owned by Qin Xuan. However,
the weather spirit worked together with a shapeshifting beast soul
to enhance the user’s physique, while the devil sword could only be
used on another sword.</p>
<p>For Han Sen, this was a very useful type of beast soul. If Han
Sen was not able to gain a super beast soul weapon, he could only
choose to use a sacred-blood weapon when hunting super creatures,
which would be very difficult. With this devil sword, a
sacred-blood sword could be enhanced. Although the enhanced weapon
might still fall short to a super beast soul, it would be
undoubtedly much stronger than an ordinary sacred-blood weapon.</p>
<p>Taking up the diamond sword, Han Sen used the devil sword on it.
Black smoke suddenly filled the diamond sword, making the
crystal-clear sword look like it was made of onyx, exuding
brilliance.</p>
<p>Han Sen brandished the sword and tested it on a piece of
Z-steel, which was cut in half instantaneously like it was
tofu.</p>
<p>“Impressive!” Han Sen became overjoyed. The devil sword was
indeed a fantastic add-on. Unwilling to test it on any sacred-blood
weapons, Han Sen was not sure how strong it actually was.</p>
<p>“Both the flame lieutenant and devil sword will be great help
for me to kill super creatures. These nests are indeed full of
treasures. I wished there were more…” Although Han Sen did not gain
a super beast soul, he was not too disappointed.</p>
<p>Taking back the beast soul and putting down the diamond sword,
Han Sen teleported back to Blackhawk.</p>
<p>The sacred-blood murky beast brought five more sacred geno
points to Han Sen. Now he had 78 sacred Geno points.</p>
<p>At this point, unless there was a hunting campaign for
sacred-blood creatures, Han Sen rarely went out. He spent most of
his time on practicing Panorama, trying to reach a balance of all
kinds of abilities. This way, it was easier for him to hunt a super
creature while protecting himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested for a night and went to the training hall in the
morning. He picked a holographic device and logged in Gladiator
again.</p>
<p>Huang Yulei and Xu Zhu had waited for him for two days. They
were about to give up since Han Sen was never online. This day when
Xu Zhu logged in, he sent another invite to “A Soldier on
Warship.”</p>
<p>This time, he did not hear the prompt tone of the system. Xu Zhu
quickly sent a voice message to Huang Yulei, “Huang Yulei, the
soldier is online.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Where are you? Did he agree to fight? This time we must
teach him a lesson,” said Huang Yulei hurriedly.</p>
<p>When Xu Zhu was about to answer, he found himself in the
Colosseum already. Obviously, his opponent had agreed to the
challenge.</p>
<p>“He agreed. Hurry over to watch.” Xu Zhu quickly sent Huang
Yulei an invite to observe.</p>
<p>Huang Yulei clicked yes and found himself on the stands of the
Colosseum and he was not alone.</p>
<p>Huang Yulei was surprised to find someone else there, and he
knew that person as well.</p>
<p>“Desperado, how come you’re here as well?” Huang Yulei quickly
asked the person next to him.</p>
<p>“I was about to ask you the same thing,” said Desperado.</p>
<p>“Xu Zhu asked me to watch. Did he invite you as well? He didn’t
tell me that.”</p>
<p>Desperado paused and asked, “Xu Zhu is the opponent of ‘A
Soldier on Warship’?”</p>
<p>“Yes. So, you’re not invited by Xu Zhu?” Huang Yulei looked at
Desperado, puzzled.</p>
<p>Desperado shook his head, “Xu Zhu did not invite me. ‘A Soldier
on Warship’ is in my friend list. I saw him entering a fight and
chose to watch.”</p>
<p>Huang Yulei was shocked and asked, “How come you are his friend?
Do you know him?”</p>
<p>Desperado was one of the more advanced evolvers in Ares Martial
Hall. He was only second to Queen. If Desperado was the soldier’s
friend, then it was very likely that the soldier was also a big
shot in Ares Martial Hall.</p>
<p>“No, I do not know him. I was only randomly matched with him a
couple times. I added him because I found him interesting.”
Desperado then asked Huang Yulei, “So what is this about?”</p>
<p>Huang Yulei did not answer but asked, “This person is on your
level?”</p>
<p>No wonder Huang Yulei was surprised. No evolver could beat
Desperado in Ares Martial Hall, except for Queen. Desperado said he
had fought the soldier several times, which meant the soldier was
on the same level as Desperado. In this case, there was no way that
Xu Zhu could beat him.</p>
