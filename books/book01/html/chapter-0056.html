<p>Fang Jingqi regretted his own carelessness as his face turned
red. He also blamed his loss on Han Sen’s slyness. If Han Sen
didn’t tell Xue Xi the vulgar story, he would not have been
distracted and gave Han Sen the opportunity.</p>
<p>“Another ten thousand,” said Han Sen to Xue Xi.</p>
<p>“Again.” Fang Jingqi reached his hands out.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was ready, he said to Xue Xi, "Another lovely puppy
was traveling in the desert with plenty of water and food. It found
a utility pole but it still died. Can you guess why? "</p>
<p>“Why?” Snow Xi thought about it seriously but did not think of
an answer.</p>
<p>“I was asking you.” Han Sen ignored Fang Jingqi, and turned to
look at Xue Xi.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the answer,” Xue Xi said.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll tell you. It is because there was a sign on the
pole that said ‘no peeing zone,’ then the puppy’s bladder exploded
again.”</p>
<p>Snow Xi burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi knew that it was Han Sen’s trick to get him
distracted, but he couldn’t stand Han Sen ignoring him and said to
Han Sen, “Would you rather tell stories than…”</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hands once again slapped him on the back of his hands,
which had turned red after three slaps. However, Fang Jingqi’s face
was redder than his hands.</p>
<p>“Come again.” Fang Jingqi gritted his teeth and stretched out
his arms again.</p>
<p>Han Sen put his hands back and continued his story, "Another
lovely puppy was traveling in the desert with plenty of water and
food and it found a utility pole with no sign on it. But it still
died. Can you guess why? "</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi was focused on Han Sen’s wrists, neither talking to
nor looking at Han Sen. He would give Han Sen no chance to distract
him this time.</p>
<p>After Han Sen told Xue Xi the answer, Fang Jingqi was still
staring at Han Sen’s wrists.</p>
<p>“Little brat, you will learn your lesson when it’s my turn to be
the slapper,” thought Fang Jingqi.</p>
<p>Seeing Fang Jingqi was still focused, Han Sen sighed and said,
“Jingqi, you are so calm. I’ve been the king of red hands for two
decades and no one could escape my storytelling yet. You are indeed
impressive.”</p>
<p>“Cut the crap…” Fang Jingqi said and suddenly changed his
expression. It was too late. His hand was once again slapped hard
by Han Sen.</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi bristled with anger. He hadn’t expected to be
tricked by Han Sen again.</p>
<p>“Again!” Fang Jingqi clenched his teeth and squeezed the word
out, making Xue Xi anxious on the side.</p>
<p>Han Sen put his hands in position and didn’t tell a story this
time. He said to Fang Jingqi with a faint smile, “Did you think I
won just because you were distracted?”</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi ignored Han Sen, as if he couldn’t hear anything Han
Sen was saying.</p>
<p>“I won’t move even if the sky collapsed…” thought Fang Jingqi,
determined to win this round and kick Han Sen’s ass. When he became
the slapper, he’d be the one telling Xue Xi stories and hitting Han
Sen on the hands…</p>
<p>Having noticed Fang Jingqi was still focused, Han Sen sighed and
said, “Jingqi, you are indeed a genius in playing red hands. I will
now focus and use up to 30 percent of my skills to deal with
you.”</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen putting on airs, Xue Xi laughed out loud.</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi was still staring at Han Sen’s wrists.</p>
<p>“Attention, I will use the secret skill of red hands king…” Han
Sen suddenly roared.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll keep still and see what tricks you have,” Fang
Jingqi sneered and thought.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi couldn’t escape when Han Sen made the move although
he was paying full attention this time.</p>
<p>“Again…” Fang Jingqi refused to concede defeat and wondered why
he didn’t dodge the slap. It must be some tricks used by Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it a day. As the king of red hands, I don’t want to
bully you,” Han Sen looked up and sighed.</p>
<p>“You think I cannot afford to pay? Next round.” Fang Jingqi
wanted to slap Han Sen in the face so bad, but he wasn’t a sore
loser.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame me then.” Han Sen stretched out his hands.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>“Again!”</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>“Again!”</p>
<p>Snap! Snap! Snap!</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi went berserk, not accepting the truth that he simply
couldn’t move his hands away fast enough. Han Sen was nothing but
cunning. How could he lose when he was paying attention?</p>
<p>However, Fang Jingqi could not avoid the slap no matter how hard
he tried.</p>
<p>Snap! Snap! Snap!</p>
<p>Crisp sounds kept ringing in the living room. Xue Xi was
shocked. She didn’t expect Fang Jingqi to lose, let alone to lose
in such a miserable manner. She had been worried about Han Sen but
found that she really should be worried about her brother.</p>
<p>When Fang Jingqi left Han Sen’s home, his hands were swollen
like trotters and his face was pale from anger and shame.</p>
<p>“Jingqi, come to play red hands when you have time.” Han Sen
waved goodbye to Fang Jingqi with a stack of cash in hand.</p>
<p>Fang Jingqi almost fell from the aircraft when he heard Han Sen.
“I’ll be damned if I ever play red hands with you again.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had more comments but the aircraft made a loud noise and
went away at full speed.</p>
<p>“A million easily earned. Should’ve agreed with him and made the
bet a hundred thousand each round.” Han Sen licked his lips and
took the money back to his room.</p>
