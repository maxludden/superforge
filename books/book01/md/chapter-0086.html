<p>“Sen, check out my new mount!” Su Xiaoqiao was riding his
newly-gained mutant red-hoofed beast in the yard of the Bullseye
team, bragging.</p>
<p>The mutant red-hoofed beast looked somewhat like an antelope
with a pair of buffalo horns on its head. It had the size of a
camel and was satin black all over, except for its four blood-red
hooves.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very depressed to see this gorgeous mount. He wasted
so much effort in helping this brat win a mutant mount, while he
himself ended up with nothing.</p>
<p>Although he did have a mutant mount beast soul, it was aquatic
and was useless on the land.</p>
<p>“After the martial arts contest, I have to find a way to gain a
beast soul mount. It was too much trouble going everywhere on foot
and it was bad for my image as well,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Dark Swamp was out of the question. Even if he gained a mount
beast soul there, it would be something ugly like a toad.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, come to my office.” Yang Manli called from on the
second floor.</p>
<p>“Sen, you offended her again?” Su Xiaoqiao ran over and asked,
grinning.</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?” Han Sen said, touching his nose.</p>
<p>“That was not a kind look she had. You have to be careful,” Su
Xiaoxiao laughed.</p>
<p>“You know about looks? Why don’t you say you are psychic as
well.” Han Sen laughed and went to the second floor.</p>
<p>“Manli, you asked for me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I do not know what Qin Xuan saw in you. But since she asked me
to help you prepare for the entrance exam, I’ll do my best.
Starting from today, you will report to me at the teleport station
every day and I will train you, hard. You better be prepared as you
will suffer. Blackhawk isn’t just any school.”</p>
<p>Yang Manli paused and said casually, “If you cannot bear it, you
better ask Qin Xuan to allow you to quit. I will not stop you.”</p>
<p>“When do I start?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Yang Manli before she got up and teleported to
Planet Roca with Han Sen.</p>
<p>Yang Manli took Han Sen to the test hall at the teleport
station, which was a military-standard test hall that provided more
accurate tests.</p>
<p>“You will do a detailed test first and let me see what’s the
difference between your fitness level and the lowest standard for
Blackhawk,” Yang Manli said with no expression.</p>
<p>“No need for that. I think I could definitely pass that bar.”
Han Sen did not dare to do the test, afraid he might scare Yang
with his data.</p>
<p>The last time he took the test, he had approached 10 in all his
numbers. Having gained lots of mutant and sacred geno points after
that, his fitness index should be well beyond 10 now.</p>
<p>“Do the test.” Yang Manli commanded coldly.</p>
<p>“If you insist.” Han Sen muttered and slowly walked toward the
entrance of the test hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen had made up his mind not to use his full strength, in
case Yang could tell something was wrong.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen was very confident in his control of his
own body. The more he practiced Jadeskin, the more he was amazed by
this hyper geno art. He hadn’t practiced it for long, but he
already felt that he could adjust each bone and each muscle in his
body.</p>
<p>With Jadeskin, he could even change his heart rate, blood
pressure and body temperature to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The more he understood Jadeskin, the more scared he felt.
Fortunately, Xue Longyan had already been seriously injured when
they met, or else it would have been Han Sen who got killed.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that Han Sen wouldn’t let
anyone know that he was practicing Jadeskin, for fear that people
might know Xue Longyan was killed by him.</p>
<p>The test items here were similar to those in the test center,
but were more sophisticated in general. Hence Han Sen knew what
each item was for.</p>
<p>Soon, Han Sen completed all the test items and came out of the
test hall covered with sweat.</p>
<p>Yang Manli had no idea that Han Sen looked so tired mainly
because he was trying to control the test result. To control one’s
reflexes and heartbeat was extremely difficult in such
sophisticated test items. If Han Sen hadn’t practiced Jadeskin, he
wouldn’t have been able to hide his real physical condition at
all.</p>
<p>Yang Manli looked through Han Sen’s test results and said, “Less
than 10 in all items, but close. Ten is just the standard of
ordinary military schools. For Blackhawk, even for specially
recruited students, 10 was just a narrow pass.”</p>
<p>After reading something on a smart machine, she said, “During
the time we have left which is little more than a month, I will
make all your fitness index pass 10. Meanwhile, I will train you in
archery. Only with proper archery skills will you be specially
recruited.”</p>
<p>“Manli, may I ask, without special enrollment, what kind of
score is Blackhawk looking for?” Han Sen asked curiously.</p>
<p>“When you are able to beat me, you could be admitted to
Blackhawk on your own.” Yang Manli went to the gym, not even
glancing at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her to the gym and looked at all sorts of
training equipment in the gym curiously. Many of the equipment he
had never seen before. Many soldiers were training in the gym.</p>
<p>The teleport station was part of the military, so everything
here followed military standard. The only difference was that most
soldiers here were new to the army and had never been to the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Those who could be assigned here typically had certain
connections, or else they would have been sent to the front.</p>
