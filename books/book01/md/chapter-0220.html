<p>Helplessness and despair made Lu Botao cringe.</p>
<p>The devil’s hand was everywhere. In all kinds of Hand of God
games that Lu Botao had experienced, he had never felt so much
despair before.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of opponent he used to meet, even if he had
lost a lot of points, he would always have some reason to finish
the game.</p>
<p>However, this game was different.</p>
<p>Whichever light spot Lu Botao wanted to hit, his opponent would
always beat him to it. No accident. No suspense. Lu Botao had never
thought that he would want to gain one point so much.</p>
<p>“One point… All I need is one point…” As a member of the
Alliance Central Military Academy, Lu Botao was a tough player.
Others might have given up at this point, but he was still hanging
in there.</p>
<p>Soon Lu Botao discovered how difficult it was to gain a
point.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The last light spot was crushed and Lu Botao was dumbstruck. 100
to 0. The score on the screen made Lu Botao collapse.</p>
<p>“Botao, were you trying to be a gentleman?” Liang Yiming asked,
uncertain. It did not look like Lu Botao was doing it on purpose.
However, there was no other explanation for Lu Botao to get a zero
either.</p>
<p>Lu Botao did not reply. Sitting up and staring at the
holographic image, he quickly sent an invite to his opponent for
another match.</p>
<p>His opponent agreed and the game started again. Lu Botao stared
at the holographic image like a monster staring at its prey,
gathering all his strength to prepare for a fierce attack.</p>
<p>When the game started, Lu Botao had lost all his confidence
under the devil’s hand.</p>
<p>No way… He could not hit anything…</p>
<p>Using all his strength and calculation, Lu Botao found his speed
and strategies useless in front of the devil’s hand.</p>
<p>That hand was everywhere. And Lu Botao felt there were a pair of
devil’s eyes watching his soul as well. No matter which light spot
he chose to hit, the devil would always be there first, smashing
his hope.</p>
<p>“No, this is not possible…” Lu Botao felt that the hand was
growing in size, taking up all the space around him, and he was
becoming smaller and smaller, reduced to a toy.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The game had not even ended, but Lu Botao had already collapsed
on his chair, all his confidence and courage gone.</p>
<p>Liang Yiming next to him was also soaked in cold sweat. In the
second match, he tried to imagine him as Lu Botao, and soon he
became desperate as well, because he found out that he would not be
able to hit anything either. It was not Lu Botao’s fault. The
opponent acted as if she could read people’s mind.</p>
<p>" Lu Botao, this is Ji Yanran from Blackhawk? Are you sure this
is not an evolver?" Liang Yiming could not believe that this person
was a military school student.</p>
<p>" I have no idea…" Lu Botao was not sure either. He looked at
his opponent’s ID and said, “This is her ID and this is the
unevolved section. The evolvers shouldn’t be able to enter this
part.”</p>
<p>Liang Yiming heard Lu Botao’s theory and agreed. If his opponent
was an evolver, that person would be sent to a different
section.</p>
<p>But some evolvers who had not yet registered in the Alliance
would be able to still enter the unevolved section. So that was a
possibility.</p>
<p>“If this person is unevolved, then it’s too scary. Maybe only
the monster from our school could be her match,” Liang Yiming
said.</p>
<p>“Who are you…” Lu Botao sat up and sent a text to his
opponent.</p>
<p>Lu Botao and Liang Yiming both stared at the holographic image,
awaiting the reply.</p>
<p>In Blackhawk, Ji Yanran was sitting in Han Sen’s lap and
watching her boyfriend playing with only one hand.</p>
<p>Now she knew how she had lost to him on the spaceship. His speed
and prejudgment seemed to be beyond what a human could do.</p>
<p>From her angle, his dancing fingers were almost like they
belonged to a pianist.</p>
<p>“You scare me.” When Han Sen finished the game, Ji Yanran let
out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“How?” Han Sen whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>“You left your opponent with no points.” Ji Yanran’s earlobe
became red.</p>
<p>“He had his eyes on my girlfriend. That was unforgivable.” Han
Sens saw her cute earlobe and kissed it.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran felt electrified and shuddered.</p>
<p>At this time, the message from Lu Botao popped out. Han Sen saw
it and replied, “I am Ji Yanran’s boyfriend.”</p>
<p>He was claiming his territory.</p>
<p>“Are you a Blackhawk student?” Lu Botao’s message came
again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Han Sen. He then exited the platform. With a
gorgeous girl in his arms, he was in no mood to talk to a guy.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran realized something and her cheeks became crimson.
Looking at her gorgeous face, Han Sen could no longer resist the
temptation.</p>
<p>Although they were in public and could not go too far, Han Sen
enjoyed himself enough.</p>
<p>“Hey love birds, stop showing off like this.” Qu Lili suddenly
appeared next to them.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran immediately blushed and ran from Han Sen.</p>
<p>Watching her roommate who was blushing and Han Sen who stood up,
Qu Lili smiled, “Yanran, genius, I did not mean to interrupt you.
It’s just Ji Yanran has promised me that today she would accompany
me to pick a hyper geno art. And it’s past our agreed time.”</p>
