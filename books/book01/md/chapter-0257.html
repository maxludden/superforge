<p>“Let’s go. No need to watch anymore.” Jing Jiwu got up
first.</p>
<p>“He is indeed a formidable opponent. I look forward to fighting
against him. It’s such a shame that all his teammates are weak.”
Qin Cheng nodded. As a player who had a similar style to Han Sen,
he was very impressed by Han Sen’s ability to judge correctly.</p>
<p>Life was full of competitions, but to find a rival on the same
level was something worth celebrating.</p>
<p>When Qin Cheng observed Han Sen, he kept thinking what he would
do if he were Han Sen. And it turned out that he would do exactly
what Han Sen did.</p>
<p>Qin Cheng would have had the exact same speed, route, and
timing.</p>
<p>Although Qin Cheng had not met Han Sen officially yet, he had
thought of Han Sen as his biggest enemy and strongest opponent.</p>
<p>Now Qin Cheng wanted to beat Han Sen even more than Jing Jiwu
did. He even wished that Han Sen’s teammates could be stronger, so
that he and Han Sen could compete on the same level.</p>
<p>The moment that the Alliance Central Military Academy team left
the site, loud cheers exploded behind them. It seemed that
Blackhawk had already won.</p>
<p>In just three minutes, Smith had lost completely. It was like a
nightmare for them. They did not have any chance to shoot. Even if
they exposed themselves just a little, they would be shot
immediately. Han Sen’s arrows had eyes.</p>
<p>Archery was different from firearms. The fastest archer would
still need time and space to draw the string. That was why until
the end Fang Wending still had no opportunity to make a
comeback.</p>
<p>“It did end in less than five minutes. Professor Feng Jiulun
knew it all!”</p>
<p>“A genius is a genius.”</p>
<p>“Fang Wending will definitely win… What a statement!”</p>
<p>“Now archery is more interesting than I thought.”</p>
<p>Ji Yanran let out a sigh of relief and jumped with joy.</p>
<p>Qu Lili waved her fist and ridiculed, “Well done genius! The
so-called expert had some nerve to sit there. If I were him, I
would’ve killed myself choking on my own feces.”</p>
<p>Feng Jiulun could not say a word. He had praised Fang Wending so
hard, but Fang had suffered such a loss.</p>
<p>This victory once more put Blackhawk and Han Sen under the
spotlight. All the media that covered the archery tournament
published stories on this game.</p>
<p>Although Smith was not a strong team, Han Sen’s five arrows were
simply outstanding. In addition, Jing Jiwu had taken Han Sen so
seriously, which added to people’s interest.</p>
<p>Wen Xiuxiu spared no effort in praising Han Sen as well. She
wrote an article with the title “From Black And White Boxing to
Archery Tournament–Emperor Han Sen,” in which she introduced Han
Sen’s past experience, making more readers familiar with him.</p>
<p>After reading Wen Xiuxiu’s report, many people found Han Sen’s
black and white boxing game video on the Skynet and fell in love
with him even more.</p>
<p>As Han Sen gained more and more fans, there had been more
attention on the game between the Alliance Central Military Academy
and Blackhawk.</p>
<p>Most people hoped that Han Sen would do well, but believed that
the Alliance Central Military Academy would still win.</p>
<p>After all, Jing Jiwu’s image was more established, and he had
the best teammates who were also well-known players and could each
lead a team in any other military academy.</p>
<p>On the Blackhawk side, there were no strong players except for
Han Sen, and three of his teammates were freshmen.</p>
<p>That was why most people were excited to see the match between
Han Sen and Jing Jiwu, but did not have much hope for Blackhawk
winning.</p>
<p>No one believed that Jing Jiwu would lose. He was a monster
after all. And the monster was invincible.</p>
<p>Even the Blackhawk themselves did not have much hope. Before the
match, when Situ Xiang was explaining the tactics, she had also
said doing their best was enough.</p>
<p>The team members had the same mindset. No one dared to think
about winning.</p>
<p>Even Zhang Yang who had always been positive said it would be
good enough to finish off one or two players in Alliance Central
Military Academy.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. If it were any other game, he would not care as
much. However, this game meant a couple’s trip with his girlfriend.
He had to win.</p>
<p>However, in a team competition like this one, even he needed
support from his teammates to stand a chance in front of the
Alliance Central Military Academy.</p>
<p>If his teammates were convinced that they were going to lose,
then no one could help them.</p>
<p>“No. I must inspire their fighting spirit.” Han Sen looked at
his teammates and gazed upon Zhang Yang.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Zhang Yang was definitely the one person that
had most fight in him. However, he alone would not make much of a
difference. Han Sen hesitated and laid his eye on Situ Xiang.</p>
<p>As the coach of the school team, Situ Xiang was doing quite
well. If Han Sen did not spend too much time in God’s Sanctuary and
had more time to practice with his teammates, they could probably
do even better.</p>
<p>However, this would not make much of the difference in front of
the Alliance Central Military Academy.</p>
<p>When Situ Xiang was explaining her arrangement in the next
match, Han Sen suddenly stood up and walked to her.</p>
<p>Situ Xiang did not know what the student wanted. He should
listen to her or raise his hand instead of walking up to her.</p>
<p>“Coach, when you recruited me into the school team, didn’t you
tell me that the goal is to win the championship in this
tournament?” Han Sen walked up to Situ Xiang with his back straight
and eyes sharp.</p>
<p>“I did.” Situ Xiang nodded and blushed a little. She had to
admit that even she did not believe that Blackhawk could beat the
Alliance Central Military Academy.</p>
<p>“Then please tell us how to win this. I want to win,” staring at
the coach, Han Sen said slowly.</p>
