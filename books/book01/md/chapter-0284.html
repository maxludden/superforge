<p>As time went by, it had become harder and harder for the group
of people to resist the temptation of meat. In addition, for most
of them, a mutant beast soul was not very hard to come by. They all
had several mutant beast souls and a lot of them even had
sacred-blood beast souls.</p>
<p>The less important mutant beast souls were gradually transferred
to Han Sen for the primitive ghost-eyed bears that he killed.</p>
<p>Xu Ruyan had never visited Han Sen, but traded through Fu Shan.
Han Sen knew about it but did not say anything.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s plan was to first use the primitive ghost-eyed bears
to strip them of their less important mutant beast souls. After Han
Sen broke the egg, he would start to kill the mutant ghost-eyed
bears to trade for their key mutant beast souls. This way, he could
benefit much more than simply killing these people.</p>
<p>When Xu Ruyan paid a grand prize for entering the nest, she
would discover the egg was already gone. Han Sen wondered what
would be the look on her face at that time.</p>
<p>In these three months, Han Sen had learned more and more about
the weird footwork and dagger skills of the skeleton and saw the
light. If it were not for the fact that Han Sen was interested in
learning more about the skeleton’s tricks, he could have killed it
half a month ago.</p>
<p>At this time, Han Sen had fully grasped all the tricks the
skeleton had, it was time for him to kill the skeleton and break
the egg.</p>
<p>In darkness, Han Sen once again sneaked into the nest and was
greeted by the skeleton’s attacks per usual.</p>
<p>Different from what happened in the past, Han Sen did not plan
to retreat this time. He seized his three-blade harpoon and calmly
stared at the incoming skeleton.</p>
<p>Han Sen now knew everything about the footwork and dagger skills
of the skeleton. As the dagger almost reached him, Han Sen moved
his feet slightly and stabbed his three-blade harpoon from an
impossible angle at the skeleton.</p>
<p>Both Han Sen and the skeleton had an unpredictable style, but
the difference was that Han Sen only had one weapon, while the
skeleton had two. Even so, Han Sen was still at an advantage.</p>
<p>He knew everything about the white jade skeleton and felt like
he could control the skeleton.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen had an epiphany. The seemingly disordered
footwork and dagger skills were actually of a unique order. It was
because Han Sen’s understanding of order was too shallow that he
felt it was out of order. After three months of learning, Han Sen
finally understood the order of disorder, and gained a deeper
understanding of rhythm and order.</p>
<p>With this epiphany, Han Sen had greatly improved his way of
thinking. His opponent’s footwork and dagger skills suddenly became
boring in his eyes.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Han Sen made a fierce step. The moment
he brushed against the skeleton, the skeleton’s skull flew up into
the air. Its pair of daggers failed to hurt Han Sen, and its weird
footwork did not bring it away from the three-blade harpoon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sacred-Blood Creature Skeleton King Killed. No Beast Soul
Gained. Meat Inedible.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was not disappointed that he gained neither beast soul
nor meat, for what he had learned in the three months was much more
valuable than a sacred-blood beast soul or meat. In addition, the
sacred-blood skeleton king had a pair of gears.</p>
<p>Different from the golden axe and iron hammer, the pair of bone
daggers could be sold at an incredible price. They were on the same
level as the diamond sword, not to mention they came in a pair.</p>
<p>After appreciating his new weapons for a while, Han Sen put them
away and kept going. In the entire nest, he did not run into
another creature.</p>
<p>After reaching the end of the nest, Han Sen saw a translucent
ellipsoid set in the black stone wall. Inside the ellipsoid, there
seemed to be a flickering light.</p>
<p>The ellipsoid was taller than himself, and looked exactly the
same as eggs portrayed on the Skynet. Han Sen regarded it and used
the diamond sword to cut it open.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The ellipsoid was cut in half and liquid like glue flowed from
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Egg Broken. Identifying Beast Soul…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The voice was different from the one after a normal kill. Han
Sen did not get the beast soul directly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had also read this part on the Skynet. After breaking
the egg, the beast soul gained would be random.</p>
<p>Although it was possible to get anything between an ordinary
beast soul to a sacred-blood one, based on other people’s
experience, most people got sacred-blood beast souls, except for a
few poor devils.</p>
<p>“God bless. Don’t make me one of the poor devils, tell me this
is a sacred-blood beast soul,” prayed Han Sen.</p>
<p>Although the chance was very slim, it was still possible for Han
Sen to gain a less advanced beast soul. Before laying his eyes on
the beast soul, Han Sen was quite nervous.</p>
<p>After praying, Han Sen paused as he suddenly thought of one
thing.</p>
<p>If the beast soul gained from breaking an egg was random, would
it also be possible for him to gain a super beast soul from it?</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen did not know the existence of super
creatures. But now since he had discovered a super creature, there
must be a corresponding super beast soul.</p>
<p>Since it was random, Han Sen might as well get a super beast
soul.</p>
<p>“God, forget about my prayer just now. Let’s do it all over
again. Give me a super beast soul. This might be the very first
super beast soul gained in human history. You have to help me. And
other deities as well, I will be so pious to all of you if you
grant me a super beast soul…” Han Sen quickly took back his own
request and prayed some more.</p>
<p>The liquid from the broken egg started to glow and gradually
condensed into something like a holographic image.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the beast soul formulating in front of him
without a blink and kept praying, “Super beast soul… It has to be a
super beast soul…”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The moment the beast soul was officially formed, it turned into
a shadow and entered Han Sen’s mind. At the same time, he heard the
familiar voice.</p>
