<p>The next morning, Han Sen was on the train going to the teleport
station, with many passengers sharing his destination.</p>
<p>Most people could not afford a teleport device, so they had to
enter God’s Sanctuary using a public teleport station.</p>
<p>Today, the conductor seemed to be in a bad mood. While Han Sen
was deep in thought about what to do in God’s Sanctuary, a violent
shake of the train left everyone who was standing falling to the
sides.</p>
<p>Since he wasn’t paying attention, Han Sen also involuntarily
staggered a few steps forward and fell on something soft.</p>
<p>Subconsciously wanting to seize something to regain his balance,
he felt strange because what he was holding on to was even more
soft and tender.</p>
<p>Then he found that he had bumped into a woman in military
uniform, and his hands were on her chest.</p>
<p>“Bastard!” The woman scowled and elbowed him fast and hard. If
she were to succeed, Han Sen would have lost half his face. He
subconsciously raised an arm to block the hit, felt a strong hit on
his arm and involuntarily stepped back several steps.</p>
<p>The woman turned around and viciously stared at Han Sen. She
exclaimed with just one look: “You! Ass Fr…”</p>
<p>“Qin Xuan!” She didn’t finish her sentence, but Han Sen cried in
fear. This woman in uniform happened to be the woman from whom he
had gotten the nickname Ass Freak.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect Qin Xuan also to be on Roca Planet, and
it seemed that she had enlisted in the army.</p>
<p>Being in the military was nothing uncommon in the Alliance, as
all legitimate residents of the Alliance needed to serve at least
five years when they turned twenty. When Han Sen turned twenty, he
would also become a soldier, if there were no special reason for
him not to serve.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan recognized Han Sen, but didn’t initiate a fight. She
just looked at him with a cold and slightly disgusted look.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought ruefully, "She must think I’m a pervert now. I
don’t even blame her. I did stab her in the bottom and now… If I
were her, I’d assume the same. "</p>
<p>“There are so many planets in the Alliance, how is Qin Xuan here
as well? And what are the chances that I would meet her and did
this to her,” Han Sen thought plaintively. There was no way around
it; he would have to let the situation play itself out.</p>
<p>In the Alliance, wounding others was not allowed. Qin Xuan did
not want to make a scene, so she just glowered at him and didn’t
move further.</p>
<p>Han Sen had goosebumps from her staring and immediately got off
the train once he reached the teleport station. To his surprise,
Qin Xuan followed behind him.</p>
<p>“Dogs can’t help from eating shit. I thought you were just
innocent, while you are by nature a disgusting person,” Qin Xuan
said fiercely.</p>
<p>“You saw what happened. It was the train, and so many others
also fell. It was just a coincidence,” Han Sen said with a wry
smile.</p>
<p>“Would you believe that if you were me?” Qin Xuan said
coldly.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Qin Xuan had identified him as a bastard, so
there was no need to explain.</p>
<p>“You really are brazen, showing no remorse for what you did. It
must not be the first time you have done something like this.”
Seeing that Han Sen wasn’t going to apologize, Qin Xuan raged, “You
think I’ll just send you to the police? It’s not that easy. I can’t
beat you up here, but in God’s Sanctuary, it will be a different
story. You are going there right? I’ll wait for you.”</p>
<p>Qin Xuan immediately left and the soldiers saluted her, “Good
morning, Stationmaster.”</p>
<p>Han Sen stumbled and couldn’t believe what he saw. He almost
wanted to cry.</p>
<p>All teleport stations belonged to the military system. A
garrison was assigned to each station, and the stationmaster was
the garrison’s chief executive.</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard that the old stationmaster was to be
transferred, and he couldn’t believe that Qin Xuan would be the new
stationmaster, not even in his wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a bad feeling about the whole thing. As the
stationmaster, Qin Xuan would know his whereabouts very well.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t even possible for him to use a different teleport
station. There are three public teleport stations on Planet Roca,
but the other two were too far away, and he couldn’t waste two days
on traveling.</p>
<p>Han Sen entered God’s Sanctuary when Qin Xuan went to her
office. He decided to wait until she left the shelter before he
teleported back home.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave Qin Xuan no chance to intercept him. Taking some
meat jerky made from the mutant scorpion, Han Sen left Steel Armor
Shelter.</p>
<p>“Did I use up my luck when I found the black crystal?” Han Sen
thought, depressed.</p>
<p>He did not go far before seeing Son of Heaven and his gang
standing outside the shelter chatting.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t interested in meeting up with them and went the
other way. However, Luo Tianyang called him from behind: “Ass
Freak, come here!”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Han Sen had to turn around toward Luo Tianyang,
perplexed.</p>
<p>“I’m calling you. Come here and you’ll get lucky.” Luo Tianyang
waved to him, smiling maliciously.</p>
<p>“There is no need. I’m not strong. I can only deal with ordinary
creatures and can’t even fight primitive creatures. I am afraid I
cannot help you.” Han Sen knew it was never good when Luo Tianyang
called him.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap! Do you want a beating? I said come!” Luo Tianyang
gazed at Han Sen with his face dark.</p>
