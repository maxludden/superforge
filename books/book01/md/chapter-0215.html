<p>Sitting on a rock, Han Sen saw Huangfu Pingqing approaching.</p>
<p>Wearing a half armor, skirt and Boots, Huangfu Pingqing’s thighs
were exposed. Her figure was so attractive that Han Sen swallowed
nervously.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Han, have you waited for a long time?” Huangfu
Pingqing walked closer to Han Sen, flipping her hair and in a
flirty way.</p>
<p>“Miss Huangfu Pingqing, you could call me brother, but could you
lose the word ‘little’?” Han Sen asked, a little upset.</p>
<p>“If you will call me sister.” Huangfu Pingqing said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“After all, what do you need me for?” Han Sen changed the
subject.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you, if you want to go to the Mystery Island, I could
lend you my sacred-blood wings,” replied Huangfu Pingqing,
blinking.</p>
<p>“No strings attached?” he did not believe she was doing this out
of kindness.</p>
<p>“That’s hurtful. Just do me a favor and help me hunt the
creature on the mystery island. how about that?”</p>
<p>“Me?” Han Sen looked at Huangfu Pingqing in Surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, you can name your price. And even if you want me, I could
be yours.” Huangfu Pingqing said sensually.</p>
<p>“Ahem. With so many impressive guys in the steel armor shelter,
why would you think of me?” Han Sen continued to ask, ignoring her
reply.</p>
<p>“Although there are many great guys out there. I think you are
the best archer I have ever seen.”</p>
<p>“So who else will go, in addition to you and me?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“I will not go. There are in total three flying beast souls in
the Steel Armor Shelter. You will go on my behalf and collaborate
with Son of Heaven and Thumb in order to hunt the creature. Other
than its beast soul, you could ask for anything else.”</p>
<p>“Sister, if you don’t mind me asking, what is the relationship
between you and Son of Heaven and Thumb? Can I trust them?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“Rest assured. The mother of Son of Heaven is my mom’s sister,
which makes him my cousin. So, of course you can trust him. As for
Thumb, we have paid him and we know who he is in the alliance. He
will not dare to mess up,” explained Huangfu Pingqing.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen came to understand the relationship between Ares
martial Hall and Starry Group.</p>
<p>He did not really care about this sort of thing. Since Huangfu
Pingqing and Son of Heaven did not know Holy Angel had been killed
by him, and Huangfu Pingqing was seeking his help, it was
potentially a great opportunity.</p>
<p>“What do you need me for though? I am not really good at
combat.”</p>
<p>“All the other two guys need is a strong archer. Although I am
good at archery, but not as good as you. That’s why I want to ask
for your help. Let me know if you want something in return,”
Huangfu Pingqing said with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen pretended to think for a while and said, “I would like
to buy a sacred-blood beast soul weapon. Do you still have any
available?”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not forget about the sacred-blood three-blade
harpoon. Although the diamond sword was great, it was too
eye-catching. And since it was a sacred-blood gear rather than a
beast soul, it was not that portable.</p>
<p>“Well…” Huangfu Pingqing pondered. She did have a sacred-blood
weapon, which was exactly the three-blade harpoon that was at the
auction. Son of Heaven was planted by her at the auction and the
harpoon was actually unsold.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I still have that sacred-blood harpoon. I can
sell it to you if you want it. But the lowest price would be 150
million, which is the best I can do,” said Huangfu Pingqing
seriously.</p>
<p>“150 million…” Han Sen thought about it. It was not cheap but
not that expensive either for a sacred-blood beast soul. After all,
Huangfu Pingqing owned a company, and a company must make
profits.</p>
<p>If it was at an auction, it could easily be sold at a better
price. In addition, sacred-blood beast souls were rare, and
sometimes could not even be bought with money.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “I have 60 million in savings. Since SKTS is
still a limited edition, the one I won at the warframe contest
could probably be sold at around 70 or 80 million online. Right, I
also have a mutant flying beast soul of black-feathered beast. With
everything sold, I could come up with 150 million. Okay, let’s do
this. I really need a sacred-blood beast soul to hunt sacred-blood
creatures. If I can gain another sacred-blood beast soul, then it
will all be worth it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and said to Huangfu Pingqing,
“Alright, 150 million it is. I will buy the three-blade harpoon but
I don’t have so much money at the moment. If you could wait a
couple of days, I will sell something so that I can come up with
the money.”</p>
<p>“Why would you sell elsewhere? Have you forgotten what I do?
Tell me what you want to sell and I will offer you a good price for
them.” Huangfu Pingqing rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Huangfu Pingqing what he wanted to sell, and
Huangfu Pingqing appraised his belongings. Their agreement was that
Han Sen would use the mutant flying beast soul, the SKTS, and 60
million dollars to buy the three-blade harpoon.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I respect you a lot,” after they made the deal,
Huangfu Pingqing said to Han Sen seriously.</p>
<p>“You flatter me,” Han Sen paused and said.</p>
<p>Huangfu Pingqing shook her head and said, “I did some research
on your background. And based on who you were before entering God’s
sanctuary and what happened to you after, it is impressive that you
can become who you are today. Honestly, I have thought that if I
were you I would probably still be struggling for life and could
never have come up with 150 million to buy a sacred-blood beast
soul.”</p>
<p>As thick-skinned as Han Sen, he blushed hearing the compliment,
“Luck, it was all luck…”</p>
<p>He was not lying either. If he did not happen to gain the black
Crystal and the sacred blood black beetle Beast soul, he could
never have become who he is today.</p>
<p>Seeing that he blushed, Huangfu Pingqing could not help holding
his chin and kissed him on the cheek, “A man as capable and cute as
you is just my type. If you become more powerful, I might really
want to become your girlfriend.”</p>
