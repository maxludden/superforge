<p>“Lili, hurry! The live stream of the SKTS launch is about to
start. You won’t make it if you don’t run.” After class, Ji Yanran
and Qu Lili quickly ran across the campus.</p>
<p>Out of breath when back in their dormitory, Qu Lili saw Ji
Yanran turning her device on and watching the SKTS launch. She was
quite relieved and said, “Fortunately we made it.”</p>
<p>“You are doomed Yanran. Are you still that girl who is the
goddess of all guys and does not even spare them a glance? You just
fell in Han Sen’s laps,” Qu Lili looked at Ji Yanran’s expression
and said incredulously.</p>
<p>Ji Yan suddenly blushed, “Who said I was looking at him? I
simply want to check SKTS out. It’s an epoch-making product.”</p>
<p>“Ha! The product? Why do you stare at the contestants then?” Qu
Lili asked</p>
<p>with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran continued to quibble, “That is because he promised me
his prize. Otherwise I will never look at him.”</p>
<p>“Stop it. I know all about your family’s warframe collection.
You have even the historic warframe from the Battle of Planet
Blackdeer. You expect me to believe you care about this warframe?”
Qu Lili twisted her lips.</p>
<p>“So what? I enjoy watching my boyfriend.” Ji Yanran did not even
care at this point.</p>
<p>“Doomed. You are so doomed.” Qu Lili was surprised to see Ji
Yanran like this, changing from a goddess to an ordinary girl.</p>
<p>At the launch, a large number of media and consumers were
waiting for the release of SKTS. It was even more crowded than Liu
Changming had imagined.</p>
<p>Although there were a lot of bad comments on the Skynet, many
were simply attracted by this controversial warframe.</p>
<p>When Liu Changming walked up to the podium, the major media were
desperately taking pictures. Reporters that wanted to ask questions
were all stopped by the guards.</p>
<p>“I will not say anything but ask you to enjoy Digang’s recent
masterpiece.”</p>
<p>The gate was lifted after Liu Changming finished the sentence.
Boxes with “TS” engraved on them were neatly arranged on the shelf
in a huge warehouse.</p>
<p>“It looks the same as in the commercial!”</p>
<p>“It sure does.”</p>
<p>“It’s just the look. Its performance cannot be compared with the
ones in the commercial, right?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The media and those who wanted to buy SKTS were staring at the
rows of silver boxes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they saw two persons walking from the warehouse and to
the stage.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s Yu Qianxun and Han Sen!”</p>
<p>“They are also carrying SKTS…”</p>
<p>The journalists were taking pictures as fast as they could. And
at this time, Han Sen and Yu Qianxun exchanged a glance and turned
their SKTS on, throwing the warframes in the air.</p>
<p>Same as the scene in the commercial, the silver boxes turned
into the silver liquid and flowed down, turning into parts of
warframes and armed the two. Very soon, two SKTS were standing in
front of people.</p>
<p>“SKTS made by Digang is officially on the market.”</p>
<p>Yu Qianxun and Han Sen drove the warframes to the match venue
and started a demonstration.</p>
<p>The techniques they used bedazzled all.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s true! Everything in the commercial is true. A
biological warframe is so impressive.”</p>
<p>“Shit! Even that move is possible! Viva Digang.”</p>
<p>“This is really an epoch-making product!”</p>
<p>“That’s my dream warframe!”</p>
<p>“The new era of warframe has finally come.”</p>
<p>“A warframe revolution…”</p>
<p>“Don’t push. I came first…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The entire site was in madness. As expensive as it was, all one
hundred thousand units of SKTS were sold out almost in the blink of
an eye. Many regretted coming too late.</p>
<p>And after the launch of SKTS, the Digang Warframe Match
officially took off.</p>
<p>This day, almost all the media were crazy about SKTS. And those
who got their hands on one started to brag.</p>
<p>A variety of videos about the testing, operation, and first
impression of SKTS went viral.</p>
<p>It was as if there was only this one model of warframe in the
entire Alliance.</p>
<p>Those who were originally interested in SKTS but hesitated
because of all the rumors were very regretful.</p>
<p>“Bang!”</p>
<p>Son of Heaven smashed a glass cup. It was the opening of the
Starry Cup finals, but there were almost no reports on the Starry
Cup. Almost all of the media chose to cover Digang and SKTS
instead.</p>
<p>This was a major loss of Starry Group. And what made it worse
was that the spokesperson of SKTS was Han Sen, whom Son of Heaven
should have killed a long while back.</p>
<p>The massive Starry Cup finals turned out to be rather quiet. The
finalists all felt quite rueful about coming.</p>
<p>Had they known about how good SKTS would be, they would have
applied for the Digang Warframe Match instead of Starry Cup. Both
matches were commercial anyway, so all that mattered was the
prizes. And how could a Starry Group warframe even be compared to
SKTS, when the latter was the best and limited edition?</p>
<p>And because most of the ace players had chosen to participate in
the Starry Cup, the competition was not as fierce in the first
Digang Warframe Match. Many of the applicants to the Digang match
were the bench players of famous teams. Since they had no chance to
compete in the Starry Group, they had chosen to compete in the
Digang Warframe Match.</p>
<p>That was also a fact that contributed in Han Sen’s championship
of the Digang Match with nine victories.</p>
<p>The second place was Yu Qianxun. She only lost to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The red and blue patterns on Yu Qianxun and Han Sen’s SKTS had
also attracted a great deal of attention. Many inquired if they
could add patterns to their own SKTS, and was replied that those
were only designed for the spokespersons and would not be sold on
the market.</p>
