<p>Zhao Lianhua looked depressed. “Liu, I do not even know who this
person is. Where should I start looking?”</p>
<p>Liu Jianguo paused and said, “Go look anyway. In any case, we
must have him. He is too important for us. With him, we would soar
and it would be much easier for you to seek sponsorship in the
future.”</p>
<p>“I will try,” Zhao Lianhua said helplessly.</p>
<p>He knew this guy would have a great influence on them, but it
was not easy to find someone based just on an ID.</p>
<p>When Li Yufeng recovered from surprise and wanted to invite the
guy to fight again, he found that his opponent was already offline.
He was at loss and did not move for a long time.</p>
<p>Blackhawk went mad. It was at night but many continued to talk
about the duel.</p>
<p>“What a speed! Fucking awesome.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, after watching the duel, I know that my years of playing
that game were wasted.”</p>
<p>“Even Li Yufeng was wiped out. Ji Yanran’s boyfriend was just
amazing. Who is he anyway?”</p>
<p>“You have to ask Ji Yanran.”</p>
<p>“Twenty points, Li was not his match at all.”</p>
<p>“It is too easy to beat you… ha-ha…”</p>
<p>“My Yanran… Could he really be her boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“You really have to ask her yourself.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ji Yanran also wanted to know who her boyfriend was, but she did
not.</p>
<p>After logging out of the game, she had contacted a lot of
friends, wanting to find out who that person was. However, almost
everyone she called would tell her with a trace of gloating, “You
have to ask yourself who your boyfriend is.”</p>
<p>“How do I know who my boyfriend is!” Ji Yanran blurted out after
hearing that reply a lot of times, feeling she was out of her mind
after she realized what she had said.</p>
<p>In Room 304, Han Sen was surrounded by Shi Zhikang, Lu Meng and
Zhang Yang.</p>
<p>“Sen, four dishes and a soup in the cafeteria. One dish less
than that and I will out you,” Lu Meng said with a grin.</p>
<p>“All four dishes need to be meat. If I see anything green, I
will expose you first,” Shi added.</p>
<p>“Sen, you deserve to be my destined opponent.” Zhang Yang’s eyes
were full of sparks.</p>
<p>“Let’s go eat then. I’m hungry anyway,” Han Sen smiled and
said.</p>
<p>The four walked toward a cafeteria. Blackhawk was the size of a
small city and all cafeterias ran 24/7. There was no need to worry
about where to eat.</p>
<p>But after the four went out, they constantly heard people on the
street talking about the duel.</p>
<p>“Sen, just go ahead and admit it’s you. With your skills at the
game, maybe Ji Yanran will fall in love with you, and we can all
benefit from that by asking her to introduce her friends to us,”
Shi whispered.</p>
<p>“She is my girlfriend,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Shi made a contemptuous gesture at him.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was not the kind of girl that would fall for a good
player. Or else Li Yufeng would not have had to chase after her for
two years. Everyone knew that.</p>
<p>The four went to the nearest cafeteria, ordered a few dishes and
chatted over drinks.</p>
<p>While eating, Shi suddenly lowered his voice and said to the
rest, glancing in one direction, “There is a babe over there, the
innocent kind. So pretty! And the other two with her are not bad
either.”</p>
<p>“Shi, we don’t trust your taste.” Lu Meng laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Zhang Yang also laughed. They had all witnessed
Shi’s judgment. A tough lady six feet tall was a little beauty in
his eyes.</p>
<p>But you could not blame him either, as he was too tall himself
indeed.</p>
<p>“Really… Oh… The babe looked at me, and smiled at me. Here she
comes…” Shi flushed.</p>
<p>His roommates then felt a bit surprised. It looked like someone
really was approaching them. They turned to look and saw an
innocent, sweet girl with a great body walking toward them. It
looked like she was a freshman like themselves.</p>
<p>“Brother Han,” under the excited gaze of Shi, she walked to Han
Sen and called in a sweet voice, making Shi want to kill Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Mengmeng, why are you here?” Han Sen recognized Wang
Mengmeng.</p>
<p>“I came to eat with my classmates and did not expect to meet you
here. Let me introduce them. These are my classmates and roommates,
Li Zhenzhen and Wang Chun.” Wang Mengmeng introduced the two girls
following her to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Hello.” Han Sen shook hands with the two girls, and introduced
his three roommates.</p>
<p>“Since we are all friends now, shall we sit together?” Shi
pulled the chairs and invited the girls.</p>
<p>“Well, we happen to have something to ask,” Wang Mengmeng
blushed and said.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? We will do anything for you,” promised
Shi.</p>
<p>Wang Chun looked at Shi and seemed very happy, “It would be
great if you could help. We are looking for people to join our
society. Have you already registered at some societies? If not, can
you join us?”</p>
<p>“Well, we did not register yet, so you have come to the right
people. With us, your society will do so well. Right, which society
are you talking about?” Shi quickly said, making faces to his
roommates to ask them to play along. Judging from the three girls’
looks, it was easy to tell that the society they were in must have
lots of babes.</p>
<p>“We are with Heavy Warframe Society,” said Wang Chun.</p>
<p>Shi almost choked on the water he just drank.</p>
<p>Warframe Society was considered a temple of monks, where members
were almost all guys. And Heavy Warframe Society would be Shaolin
Temple among all temples, where girls were probably nowhere to be
seen. The guys had not expected the girls to be members of Heavy
Warframe Society.</p>
<p>The reason why Heavy Warframe Society was independent from
Warframe Society was that heavy warframes were much bigger in size
than average warframes and were much harder to operate. Ordinary
soldiers did not need to use heavy warframes, and 99.99 percent of
those who operated heavy warframes were male.</p>
