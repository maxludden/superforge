<p>After lunch, Chen Ling left satisfied. Ji Yanran and Qu Lili had
classes in the afternoon, so Han Sen had to spend the time
alone.</p>
<p>At this point, he had almost recovered from his burns. Recently,
he had been in so many classes that he was a bit tired of studying,
and decided to go test his physical fitness.</p>
<p>He had not tested his fitness in a long time, and had no idea
how well he could do.</p>
<p>After reaching the test hall, Han Sen chose to pay for a private
test room so that none could see his test result.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen only planned to test a few key items, such as
strength, speed and reflex.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang!</p>
<p>With a fierce blow on the machine, the number 15.4656 showed on
the screen.</p>
<p>And as Han Sen bolted, his speed was rated 15.76665.</p>
<p>He was rated above 15 in all his test items, which surprised
him.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Alliance, when one maxed out
on all four kinds of geno points, one could reach 15 in these
items. If one was especially good at certain things, then one might
be rated 16 or 17 in one or two items.</p>
<p>But now Han Sen was quite lacking in sacred and mutant geno
points, and his test results were already higher than 15, which was
a bit scary.</p>
<p>If he continued like this, even Han Sen could not be not sure
how high his fitness index would be when he maxed out on
everything.</p>
<p>Han Sen guessed that this was because he had practiced Jadeskin.
Hyper geno arts could enhance one’s fitness, but he had never heard
of any improvement like his. Normally, one who had practiced hyper
geno arts could reach 17 or 18 when one maxed out on all geno
points, and might reach 20 in one or two items.</p>
<p>But Han Sen estimated his fitness index could probably pass 20
when he maxed out, which was something unheard of before.</p>
<p>Coming out of the test room, Han Sen encountered a man who had
stopped and seemed to recognize Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not recognize this guy, so he continued on.</p>
<p>“So you will participate in that black and white boxing
competition?” the man suddenly said.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped and looked around to make sure this man was
talking to him.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are?” Han Sen looked him up and down. This man was
about twenty. He was tall and slender and his face had some tough
lines. He looked like a shining weapon, with a unique
sharpness.</p>
<p>“Ouyang Xiaosan.” The man’s voice was without emotion.</p>
<p>“You are him! Glad to be your teammate.” Ouyang Xiaosan was a
celebrity in the Martial Arts Department, and Han Sen had heard of
him. He was the slugger in all kinds of competitions and Han Sen
thought he would be in this one as well.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen reaching out his hand, Ouyang was not about to
shake it. Ouyang Xiaosan said coldly, “I did not sign up for
that.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen was surprised. As one of the best players, how
was it possible that Ouyang was not on the team?</p>
<p>“I know we won’t win, so that would be a waste of time. It’s
pointless to waste one’s time and energy on some stupid game like
that anyway.” Ouyang regarded Han Sen. “I have seen the match
between you and Yu Mingzhi. You have talent. Are you interested in
joining the Martial Arts Society? With my training, you could
become an excellent martial arts player. The two of us might have a
chance at the championship of the Alliance Tournament.”</p>
<p>Looking at Ouyang, Han Sen smiled and said, “I understand now.
It was because you did not want to participate that the team was
one man short. And that was why they came to me.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to transfer to the Martial Arts Society?” Ouyang
continued to ask with no expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s make a bet. And if you win, I can promise to join
your society. If you lose, you will join this black and white
boxing game.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“I never bet on luck,” Ouyang said quietly.</p>
<p>“Black and white boxing duel, best of nine,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“OK,” Ouyang agreed without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“It is just black and white boxing, so we can just pick a
private test room and do it here,” Han Sen said and walked back
into the room where he took the tests. He swiped his card and said
to Ouyang, “I’ll put down the room fee first. And the loser will
pay for the room.”</p>
<p>Ouyang followed him inside in silence, and then closed the
door.</p>
<p>The two stood face to face, prepared.</p>
<p>“Shall we flip a coin to decide who attacks first? Which side do
you want?” Han Sen took out a coin and put it in his palm.</p>
<p>“Tails,” Ouyang said.</p>
<p>Han Sen casually threw the coin in the air and caught it. It was
tails.</p>
<p>“You first.” Han Sen saw Ouyang’s fist as soon as he finished
the two words.</p>
<p>Ouyang’s punch was fast and ruthless, as if there was no turning
back.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not dodge, or even raise his hand. He simply
stood there watching Ouyang’s fist approaching his face.</p>
<p>Ouyang’s punch stopped less than an inch away from Han Sen’s
nose. The contrast between the dynamic and static forces was so
strong that it was dazzling.</p>
<p>“Deliberate in counsel, prompt in action. Well done.” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>“Losing is losing. Your turn,” Ouyang said. A punch of that kind
of speed and strength was not enough to deceive Han Sen, who did
not even try to block it and was confident that it was a white
fist.</p>
<p>“Do you know what ID I am going to use?” Han Sen did not throw a
punch, but smiled at Ouyang and asked.</p>
<p>“That has nothing to do with me,” said Ouyang indifferently.</p>
<p>“No, it has. My ID is Black Fist Emperor. So, for this punch, I
will be using a black fist. Pay attention and don’t copy my
reaction. At least you need to block it with your hand, so that you
don’t get injured too badly,” Han Sen said earnestly.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Just attack.” Ouyang had been in numerous
competitions and was tough mentally. He was not the least swayed by
Han Sen’s words.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly threw his punch at Ouyang in an equally fast
and ruthless manner.</p>
