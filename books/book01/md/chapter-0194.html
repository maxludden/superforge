<p>As Ouyang dodged, Han Sen’s fist froze in the air.</p>
<p>It was obvious that if this punch was a black one, Han Sen would
not be able to stop it, which meant it was a white fist.</p>
<p>“Why… why is it a white fist…” Ouyang’s confidence was smashed
by this white fist.</p>
<p>Exactly the same way of using his strength, and Ouyang had made
the same judgment. Only this time, he acted against his own
judgment. However, he was still wrong.</p>
<p>This white fist that had stopped half way was harder on him than
a thousand actual punches.</p>
<p>“Why did you use a white fist?” Staring at Han Sen, Ouyang
wanted to know the answer.</p>
<p>“There are three levels in black and white boxing: observing the
people, observing the heart and observing the body. You are still
observing the body. And I am beginning to observe the heart. That’s
why I won.” Han Sen smiled at Ouyang. “Remember to register for the
competition and pay me back for the room next time we meet
again.”</p>
<p>Ouyang watched him going and froze for a long time until Han Sen
had disappeared from his sight.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Chen Ling was both happy and worried. She was happy that Han Sen
had promised to participate, while worried that Ouyang had refused
to participate.</p>
<p>If Ouyang and Han Sen could join forces, maybe Blackhawk could
be the champion of the Skynet competition.</p>
<p>Although this game was not that important, but Blackhawk had not
been a champion in a long time. This championship would still be a
big comfort to her, a part-time coach of the Martial Arts
Society.</p>
<p>“Xu Qian, is Ouyang here?” Chen Ling called Xu Qian over.</p>
<p>" I have not seen him," Xu Qian looked around and said.</p>
<p>“Let me know when he’s here.” Chen Ling wanted to make the final
effort.</p>
<p>Suddenly Chen Ling saw Ouyang coming through the door and
quickly walked to him.</p>
<p>"Ouyang, I know the old players’ retirement reflect negatively
on our results, but you need to give the young players a chance to
grow… "</p>
<p>“Count me in,” cut in Ouyang before Chen could finish.</p>
<p>“Do not rush to refuse. You listen to me, we have invited Han
Sen in the match against St. Germain. If you…” Chen Ling suddenly
realized what he had said and was surprised. “You just said you
will participate?”</p>
<p>“If you have the form,” Ouyang said indifferently.</p>
<p>Chen Ling quickly asked someone to bring him the application.
She felt odd and asked, “How did you suddenly change your
mind?”</p>
<p>Xu Qian and others also came. They were all glad that Outyang
would join them. He was, after all a star player and had
contributed great performance. With Ouyang and Han Sen, they were
confident they could beat St. Germain.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Han Sen was their replacement for Ouyang.
Even with Han Sen, they thought it would be hard to beat Saint
Germain.</p>
<p>The old players had all graduated and Ouyang was the only one
left. Martial Arts Society was now in a hard place and did not have
much to offer.</p>
<p>Now with Ouyang’s return and Han Sen’s participation, their
strength had been greatly increased.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was unexpected that Ouyang suddenly changed
his mind. He was particularly cold, and was not easy to get along
with. They could not imagine how his mind was changed.</p>
<p>“Because I lost to Han Sen and he told me to.” Ouyang filled the
form out.</p>
<p>But Chen Ling and the members of Martial Arts Society were
shocked.</p>
<p>Although they knew the story of Han Sen and Yu Mingzhi, but they
thought Ouyang was probably even better than Yu.</p>
<p>In the Alliance Tournament, the top 10 would not be inferior to
the Chosen.</p>
<p>After all, the Alliance Tournament did not allow beast souls. In
terms of fighting skills and physical fitness, Ouyang was the best
of the best.</p>
<p>Such a person said he lost to Han Sen, which was shocking.</p>
<p>“How many rounds did you play?” Xu Qian asked.</p>
<p>“Five,” Ouyang casually replied.</p>
<p>“So that is three to two?” Xu Qian continued to ask.</p>
<p>“Five to zero; he was five, and I was zero,” Ouyang said, giving
the form that he had filled out to Xu Qian who opened his mouth so
wide that it could fit a duck egg.</p>
<p>“Five to zero, Han Sen did that?”</p>
<p>Not only all members of the Martial Arts Society were
dumbfounded, but Chen Ling also looked surprised.</p>
<p>The worst score Ouyang had seen was one to four. And his
opponent was someone who ranked first in black and white boxing in
the Alliance.</p>
<p>Five to zero, they could not believe how good Han Sen was.</p>
<p>But since Ouyang had said that himself, it was true without a
doubt. There was no reason for him to lie about that.</p>
<p>“We will win this time! St. Germain, wait for our comeback.”
Chen Ling and the students were so excited they were
speechless.</p>
<p>Since there is such a player in their team, coupled with Ouyang,
beating St. Germain was a piece of cake.</p>
