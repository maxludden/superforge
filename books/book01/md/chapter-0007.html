<p>“Brother, you killed all these swift mantises?” Su Xiaoqiao saw
no one except for the guy in golden armor.</p>
<p>The dead mantises were still bleeding, so they couldn’t have
been dead for long. Su Xiaoqiao couldn’t believe that someone was
able to kill so many mantises in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Although the swift mantis was only a primitive creature,
considering the sharpness of its forelegs and its speed, even those
who had maxed out on primitive geno points didn’t dare to provoke
it.</p>
<p>After all, there were too many weak spots on human body, and no
one wanted to risk losing his life or getting severely injured from
a mantis cut.</p>
<p>There were at least three dozen dead swift mantises on the
ground. Even Qin Xuan would need some helping hands to achieve
this. Su Xiaoqiao wouldn’t believe that someone could have done it
alone.</p>
<p>“Want some? A thousand Levo dollars each.” Han Sen was just
considering what to do with the mantises. He was on a killing spree
and forgot the fact that there was no way he could eat so much
mantis meat. And even if he could eat them all, only the first few
could gain him geno points.</p>
<p>“A thousand each? Are you sure?” Su Xiaoqiao looked at him,
surprised. Although many people were able to hunt primitive
creatures, they were in short supply, especially the ones that most
people had never eaten, like swift mantis.</p>
<p>After all, people’s energy was limited, and there was a limit to
how many geno points the meat from the same type of creature could
offer. Only by eating the flesh of a variety of creatures could one
keep collecting geno points.</p>
<p>Those who were relatively well-off would all be willing to pay
for the creatures they hadn’t eaten yet in order to be able to
quickly max out on their primitive geno points.</p>
<p>Therefore, the primitive creatures that were easy to kill could
bring a few hundred each, while the ones that were difficult to
hunt, such as the swift mantis, could sell for two or three
thousand each and still be in short supply.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoqiao calculated and figured that he could double or
triple the price if he could transport these mantis bodies
back.</p>
<p>“Yes, a thousand Levo dollars each.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Han Sen did not know what the mantises were
worth. Without a car or other tools, there was simply no way he
could move all these bodies back on his own.</p>
<p>And if he left now, the bodies might be stolen when he
returned.</p>
<p>Moreover, Han Sen did not want to waste his time and energy on
this. He had more important things to do, and he could take some
loss of the profits—as the wholesaler, he had to leave some profit
to the retailer.</p>
<p>“Sure, I’ll take them all. How many are there?” Su Xiaoqiao was
onboard. The swift mantises could bring him more than money.</p>
<p>Primitive creatures like the swift mantis that ordinary people
couldn’t easily access would make great gifts. No one could refuse
such a nice offer, as long as they hadn’t maxed out on primitive
geno points.</p>
<p>“A total of forty-three. I’ll give you a discount and charge
only forty thousand.” Han Sen was just casually asking and did not
expect this ordinary-looking guy to be so rich that he could buy
them all.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoqiao took out his wallet and pulled out ten
ten-thousand-dollar notes. “Brother, I’ll give you fifty thousand
for these mantises. The other fifty thousand is a down payment for
whatever good stuff you may have in the future. I’ll always give
you a good price and would pay even higher for mutant creature
flesh.”</p>
<p>A hundred thousand was a small amount for Su Xiaoqiao. It would
even cost him as much to buy someone a fancy dinner. This person
was so bad-ass that he killed all these mantises on his own, so it
was highly likely that he could hunt mutant creatures too. If it
was possible to purchase mutant creature flesh from him, a few
hundred million was nothing.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t tell you were rich,” Han Sen took the money and said
bluntly, looking at Xiaoqiao slightly surprised.</p>
<p>“In all honesty, money is all I have. If you have mutant
creature flesh to sell, do let me know. The price is definitely not
a problem,” Su Xiaoqiao boasted, afraid that he might lose this
great opportunity.</p>
<p>“Great. What’s your name and address? I will come and find you
if I have something.” Han Sen appreciated Xiaoqiao’s generosity,
and thought he might be an ideal buyer for the mutant creature he
planned to produce using the black crystal.</p>
<p>After all, the black crystal had to remain a secret. Selling the
creature to one person was much better than selling it in the
market in front of everyone.</p>
<p>And he didn’t even need to worry about the price since Xiaoqiao
was incredibly rich.</p>
<p>“Brother, my name is Su Xiaoqiao, and that’s my real name. My
room number at Steel Armor Shelter is 1046. How about you? What’s
your name and where do you live?” Su Xiaoqiao said.</p>
<p>“Call me Dollar. That’s the only thing I care about. Prepare
some money, and I’ll go to room 1046 once I have something.” Han
Sen put the money into his pocket, waved goodbye to Xiaoqiao and
left Zephyr Valley.</p>
<p>Having been through his father’s death, Han Sen did not want to
have too many exchanges with others. He just wanted to take care of
his mother and sister and do his own thing. Other people or things
didn’t really affect him.</p>
<p>"Brother, I’ll wait for you. You must come! Remember, the price
is definitely not a problem… " Su Xiaoqiao shouted at the back of
Han Sen while waving his hand.</p>
<p>After Han Sen left, Su Xiaoqiao couldn’t help but call out: “How
could I get these back?”</p>
<p>Su Xiaoqiao thought for a while and decided to carry some back
in a bag and ask some friends to help him carry the rest.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were almost no humans in Zephyr Valley. When
Su Xiaoqiao came back with friends, all the bodies were still
there.</p>
<p>“Xiaoqiao, is it true that Dollar killed all these swift
mantises?” Su Xiaoqiao’s friends looked wide-eyed at the pile of
mantis bodies.</p>
<p>“Of course. Although I did not see him hunting, there was no one
else in Zephyr Valley at the time and the mantises had just died.
Who else could it be?” Su Xiaoqiao said.</p>
<p>"I think it must be a gang of people that killed these swift
mantises, and others must have left him to deal with the bodies. I
don’t believe one person could kill so many mantises. He must be
bragging! "</p>
<p>“He was definitely bragging.”</p>
<p>None of Su Xiaoqiao’s friends believed Han Sen killed the swift
mantises alone.</p>
