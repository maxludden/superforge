<h2>Spirit Gene</h2>
<h3>Chapter 896</h3>

<p>Han Sen did not move. He cast the Dongxuan Sutra, which had his
fingers generate a coin, and fired it at the approaching
monkey.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>The coin stuck to the monkey’s head. Almost immediately, its
head swiveled down and the body followed, collapsing to the ground.
Writhe as it might, it could not get back up.</p>
<p>The red-haired monkey tried to scream, but when it opened its
mouth, Han Sen fired another coin. It landed directly on its lips,
shutting them completely. The added weight propped the monkey into
a position not unlike it was bowing to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the monkey once more, turned, and left.</p>
<p>Han Sen had managed to simulate the power of the Dollar Toad
that he had observed during his battle with it. He had only
unlocked his first gene lock, so he couldn’t simulate it perfectly.
Its effectiveness was not half of what it could be, once Han Sen
had his next few gene locks open. Still, it was enough to suppress
the advance of the monkey, and it did more than his Sonic-Thunder
Punch could ever hope to do.</p>
<p>After dealing with his simian aggressor, he went to the other
side of the market to see if there was anything useful for
sale.</p>
<p>After a short while browsing the wares, a spirit cut in front of
Han Sen and blocked his advance.</p>
<p>“Has the monkey’s master come looking for me?” Han Sen frowned,
and put himself into a state of silent alert.</p>
<p>The spirit looked like a man. Its ears were like the fins of a
fish, and it only possessed one red eye.</p>
<p>“How might I address you?” Surprisingly, the spirit bowed before
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“My name is San Mu. What’s up?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I saw you teach that monkey a lesson. The power you have seems
efficient in restricting the movements of your opponents. With that
power you possess, I am hoping you will be able to help me out on a
certain matter. I can pay you spirit genes, in return for your
compliance and aid,” the spirit politely requested.</p>
<p>Han Sen initially believed the spirit had approached him in a
hunt for trouble; he never expected it to come looking for his
help.</p>
<p>“How can I help?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I want to tame a wind beast. Unfortunately for me, its power is
grand, and the likelihood of it submitting itself to serving and
obeying me seems low. It is my desire that you suppress it, buying
me the appropriate time to do what I must to tame it,” the spirit
explained.</p>
<p>“What is your level? And how many spirit genes are you willing
to pay?” Han Sen was interested in the proposition.</p>
<p>“My name is Yu Yan, and I am a Knight. I can pay you with ten
fire-element spirit genes,” the spirit said.</p>
<p>“Okay. But if you are unable to tame it yourself after I do my
part, you must still pay me,” Han Sen responded.</p>
<p>“Of course; in fact, how about I pay you in advance?” Yu Yan
reached his hand out. A fire was birthed in the palm of his hand,
and it then drifted through the air towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen caught the drifting fire, and the golden flames melted
into the skin of his own hands.</p>
<p>“Knight-class Fire Gene +1.”</p>
<p>Yu Yan gave him nine more of such flames, and Han Sen accepted
each one.</p>
<p>The Fire Gene wouldn’t make Han Sen physically stronger, but it
would serve well whenever he wished to deal fire damage. His fire
attacks and fire resistances would both be increased.</p>
<p>If he did not practice the works and arts of fire, it would have
been a waste. But Han Sen could practice every element,
fortunately.</p>
<p>After receiving the Spirit Genes, Yu Yan and Han Sen left the
market. They went to a serene park that was situated elsewhere in
the shelter. There were many ordinary creatures around, and it was
quickly and clearly estalished that Yu Yan was a high-level spirit
in the vicinity.</p>
<p>In a cage, Han Sen saw the wind beast already trapped. It was a
lime-green giant wolf that kept casting blades of winds at the bars
of its suppression, growling and howling ferociously.</p>
<p>Han Sen fired a coin at the wind beast. There was no fear of
missing, due to it being trapped in the cage; therefore, the coin
landed where he wanted it to. The wolf looked slightly heavier and
more bedraggled, but it didn’t collapse to the ground just yet.
Knowing what was happening, however, the wolf did its best to
attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>He fired another seven coins at the wolf, and after that, the
wolf no longer looked as angry. It was heavy and of a glum,
hopeless mood.</p>
<p>“The first-tier of the Dongxuan Sutra really is much weaker. If
I was like the toad, creatures such as this would only have to
suffer two of these coins. I really need to get to work on opening
my gene locks,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Yu Yan was happy with the results, though. After the wolf’s
desire for violence came to an end, he opened the cage without
delay. Then, he leaned forward to leave his mark on the beast’s
forehead.</p>
<p>But the wolf, despite hardly being able to move, was not willing
to accept the stamp.</p>
<p>Yu Yan drew a whip, and with a lash, flames enwreathed its
leathery length. He whipped the wind beast’s body, inflicting a
nasty burn mark across it.</p>
<p>After a few more lashes, the wolf’s fur had been mostly seared
off. It was a wretched sight, the proud animal’s thick, full mane
of fur having been reduced to dark, smoldering skin.</p>
<p>But the wind beast still wasn’t willing to submit. It growled
repeatedly at Yu Yan and Han Sen, and it didn’t look likely to
submit anytime soon.</p>
<p>Yu Yan did not stop whipping, though. And before long, the wolf
could no longer move. Its body was pitch-black with its charring,
and it could no longer stand. It collapsed and continued to whimper
down on the ground, as if it was going to die.</p>
<p>Yu Yan got tired hitting the beast, and with much
disappointment, regretfully said, “This beast is too far gone. With
how wild it is, I fear I’ll never be able to tame it. Perhaps it
shouldn’t come as a surprise; it is a creature that hails from the
Thorn Forest, after all.”</p>
<p>“It comes from the Thorn Forest?” Han Sen looked at the wind
beast in shock.</p>
<p>“Yes, I found it during my venture there. Four of its gene locks
have been opened, and it took the sacrifice of a dozen ordinary
creatures to capture it. Yet despite all that, I cannot tame it.
Killing it solely for its meat would be a grand waste,” Yu Yan
mournfully explained, as he watched the dying beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at the beast and said, “Would
you be willing to sell it?”</p>
<p>“If I can’t tame it, of course I will. How much are you willing
to pay?” Yu Yan smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, how about this?” Han Sen pulled out a coin; a
copper-fruit.</p>
