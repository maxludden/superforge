<p>When Han Sen saw his power manifest inside the forehead slot of
the spirit statue, it created what appeared to be a white spirit
stone. At the sight of this, Han Sen froze.</p>
<p>“Your spirit stone has linked with the spirit base. Would you
like to enter?” A strange voice sounded from the statue.</p>
<p>“What is a spirit base?” Han Sen then watched the spirit stone
fire a beam of light at him. Upon contact with this light, he was
sucked into the spirit stone.</p>
<p>The sensation he felt was not too dissimilar to that of a
teleporter, and after the dimensions unraveled before his eyes, he
found himself standing on an island.</p>
<p>The island was as small as a basketball pitch, and it appeared
to have been formed from finely chiseled jade. It was as if he was
standing at the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Stars populated the skies above and around him, but upon closer
inspection, they weren’t what they first appeared to be. They were
other jade islands, shining brightly.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen had no idea what was going on, and
he was shocked to realize he was still in super spirit mode. He
felt as if he could remain in this state forever.</p>
<p>It surprised him, because he knew for a fact he could only last
four seconds. Now, the mode had been activated for ten seconds with
no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>Of course, he knew it had something to do with the spirit base.
Had he not entered this place, it wouldn’t have continued in this
way.</p>
<p>“Really? What is this place?” Han Sen looked at the statue that
was standing before him.</p>
<p>“Spirit Base.” The statue’s lips did not move, but Han Sen could
hear it speak with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>“Can I return?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You can leave whenever you desire. Would you like to leave
now?” the statue said.</p>
<p>“Not yet.” Han Sen felt safer, hearing what the statue told him.
So, he looked around at all the other islands in the sky and asked
the statue, “What can I do here?”</p>
<p>“You may challenge or be challenged. If you defeat other spirits
here, you will obtain spirit geno points,” the statue answered.</p>
<p>“Can I die here?” Han Sen frowned as he asked this.</p>
<p>“No; you will lose one self geno point and be returned to your
spirit stone,” the statue answered.</p>
<p>“What is a self geno point? How many do I have?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“You have one, and you do not have a rank in the spirit base.
Challenge a spirit in the first spirit base, and once you are
ranked, you will be unable to battle those that are ranked lower
than you.” The statue was replying like an answer-dispensing
machine.</p>
<p>“What is the first spirit base? Are you saying there are more?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“When you open your first gene lock, you are given access to the
first spirit base. If you open your second gene lock, you will be
given access to the second spirit base, and so on.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to ask more questions, but suddenly, an island
floated towards him. Upon it stood a spirit that looked like a
giant.</p>
<p>“Ah, a new spirit has just arrived. How lucky for me. Challenge
me!” the giant spoke to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“How did you know I have only just entered this place?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>“Your statue does not possess a rank. Come challenge me,” the
giant said as he pointed at Han Sen’s statue.</p>
<p>The giant had already been ranked, so he could not challenge Han
Sen. If Han Sen wished to challenge the giant, however, that would
be allowed.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed a bunch of numbers appearing before the statue
on his island. Han Sen counted them, and noticed it was the figure
of ninety million. If that was the giant’s rank, then he was
incredibly low.</p>
<p>“Fine; I’ll challenge you.” He was going up against a spirit
that had only opened its first gene lock; therefore, he had nothing
to be afraid of.</p>
<p>“Come on, then. Bring it!” The giant looked extremely happy, and
his fist burst into flames like a meteor breaching the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast his Sonic-Thunder Punch and smashed the giant into
pieces; then the spirit returned to his spirit stone.</p>
<p>As the body disappeared, a red light entered Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>“Nightfire Gene +1; Rank Achieved.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at his nightfire genes and noticed he had eleven
of them.</p>
<p>He looked at the statue and saw there was a number there. The
number was the same one the giant had possessed, and when he looked
towards the giant’s statue, it had disappeared.</p>
<p>“This is interesting. I can get a lot of spirit geno points
here.” Han Sen was immeasurably happy.</p>
<p>His power was fixed in super spirit mode, but although he could
employ any element, there were no buffs applied.</p>
<p>If he was able to gather many spirit geno points, he could max
out all his buffs. He’d have a greater resistance to the elements,
and he’d be far stronger.</p>
<p>“Are you a king spirit?” The giant respawned and looked at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Han Sen answered queerly. He was only a king spirit
when he decided to turn into one.</p>
<p>“My name is Flame Giant. Might you tell me your king title?” The
giant knelt in front of Han Sen, as if he was smitten with him. The
spirit was acting as if it’d be a great honor for him to learn his
title.</p>
<p>“My title is The King,” Han Sen randomly spouted.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a king spirit, so he was able to make a title up.</p>
<p>He was in super king spirit mode, so the spirit in front of him
was of a lower class. As such, he decided to title himself above
most others by claiming the title of The King.</p>
<p>“You are The King! It is a most wondrous and glorious
opportunity I have received, to see you. Your title will be heard
by all one day, that is for sure! And one day, you will indeed be
an emperor.” Flame Giant poured out praise in abundance.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed in his heart, saying to himself, “I am already
The King. There is no need for me to become an emperor.”</p>
