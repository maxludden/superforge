<h2>Infiltrating the Shelter</h2>
<h3>Chapter 906</h3>

<p>Han Sen and Qu Lanxi spared no time in running to Qing Ming
Shelter. There, they saw Chu Ming hanging from above the gate. His
body was caked in dried blood, and other wounds oozed without
healing. He looked to be dying.</p>
<p>Han Sen was quickly brought to anger. Humans were treated as
little more than free-range slaves in the Third God’s Shelter, and
any little mistake was met with wicked, brutal punishments.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had not have revived the tree in the first place,
though, Chu Ming would not have suffered this treatment. Chu Ming
didn’t deserve any of this.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi was not calm by any means, either. In great anger, she
tried to take Chu Ming down from where he hung.</p>
<p>Han Sen, not blinded by the need to save Chu Ming at an ill cost
to themselves, quickly stopped Qu Lanxi. He brought her to a place
where they would not be immediately spotted.</p>
<p>“Don’t be reckless! You can’t save Chu Ming if it means getting
yourself in trouble,” Han Sen told Qu Lanxi, as he held her in his
arms.</p>
<p>“I can’t watch him slowly succumb to death; not while I can
still do something!” Qu Lanxi pleaded, her voice pained.</p>
<p>“I know. I do not plan on letting him die, either.” Han Sen
paused briefly and then said, “It’s just that now is not the time.
You both signed a contract, didn’t you? Even if you save him now,
you are still property of Qing Ming. Your lives are forfeit to him,
and it is by his whim you can both be killed. Do not incite his
wrath any more than it already has been.”</p>
<p>“Then what do we do?” Qu Lanxi asked.</p>
<p>“We slip into the spirit hall and take the spirit stone. It is
the only way you can be free from Qing Ming Knight.” Han Sen’s eyes
gleamed with a murder as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Are you saying we claim the spirit shelter? Is that something
we can do? Is such a thing possible?” Qu Lanxi looked at Han Sen
with hopeful eyes, but still doubted the possibility of what he had
claimed.</p>
<p>Qing Ming Knight was an elite spirit that had unlocked four of
his gene locks. He had many fellow spirits and creatures in his
employ, so breaking into the spirit hall would be no small
feat.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. It’s only a knight shelter,” Han Sen said sternly.
He continued to speak coldly by saying, “If Thorn Shelter was not
nearby, I could take this place down no sweat.”</p>
<p>“I will do as you command. Whatever you desire of me, I will do
it.” Qu Lanxi looked at Han Sen. Whatever he was going to suggest
would by no means be easy, but she was willing to try no matter
what he told her.</p>
<p>“Chu Ming is still alive, so there is no immediate cause for
worry. We should go back and prepare for our next move. When we
kill Qing Ming Knight and take the spirit stone, we will have to
escape to Thorn Forest,” Han Sen said, turning to look at Chu
Ming.</p>
<p>While they spoke, a spirit wielding a whip appeared. He walked
in front of Chu Ming and struck his naked, battered body.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Chu Ming’s skin was dealt another lash, forming another lesion
across his bloody body. Although he was on the precipice of death,
Chu Ming was still able to scream loudly.</p>
<p>The spirit did not speak, and he continued to callously whip his
suffering servant. With each frightening whip, the screams of agony
from Chu Ming became quieter and quieter.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi gnawed at her lips nervously, almost to the point of
bleeding. As for Han Sen, he had come to a point of realization; he
acknowledged just how difficult living in the Third God’s Shelter
could be for humans.</p>
<p>The spirit was not willing to let Chu Ming die just yet,
however. Although he struck hard, he was not attacking anywhere
critical.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Han Sen said, as he pulled on Qu Lanxi to depart the
shelter.</p>
<p>Back in the cabin, Han Sen looked at the dying Dragon-Blood
Tree. With his analysis, he was able to determine that it was
indeed alive, but only faintly.</p>
<p>He pulled out his blood-colored dagger and tried to unearth the
roots. He wanted to see if he could move it, for he did not want to
leave it where it was.</p>
<p>It would still require a dozen years to grow, so it would
require about twelve more waterdrops. But Han Sen did not have any
time right now, so all he could hope to do was move it someplace
else.</p>
<p>After digging up the tree, he had to remove many of its roots.
Unfortunately, this only led to the tree becoming even weaker.</p>
<p>Using a cloth, Han Sen wrapped up the tree roots and gave them a
waterdrop. Then, he placed the entire tree on the back of Golden
Growler.</p>
<p>As for the Blood-Pine Tree that Han Sen had planted near the
river, he dug that up, too. He wondered if he would still be able
to grow it someplace else.</p>
<p>He was not afraid of Qing Ming Knight, and it would not be
difficult for Han Sen to take down Qing Ming Shelter; but Han Sen
could not deal with the royal class Thorn Shelter. As such, he
could only hope to hide deep within the tangled boughs of Thorn
Forest once his planned deed was done.</p>
<p>After seeing how powerful the female spirit was, he knew he
could only fight royal spirits with super king spirit mode
active.</p>
<p>But its duration was far too short. If Thorn Shelter loosed many
creatures to hunt them down, even if Han Sen could escape, Qu Lanxi
would undoubtedly be killed.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn’t claim Qing Ming Shelter once Qing Ming
Knight had been vanquished. He couldn’t make his presence known,
and as soon as the spirit that presided over the shelter was
killed, he’d have to dart off and vacate the area as soon as he
possibly could.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Qu Lanxi prepared for their grueling task ahead, and
he told her, “You wait near the gate. When I draw the spirits and
creatures deeper into the shelter, that will give you the time you
need to free Chu Ming and bring him to Thorn Forest.”</p>
<p>“Just one thing; can we really do this? Do we have what it
takes?” Qu Lanxi looked worried. She was very nervous, but Han Sen
couldn’t blame her. After all, they were on the precipice of taking
down a spirit shelter. Even though Han Sen was stronger than normal
surpassers, he was alone. A part of her believed his flight to the
shelter’s spirit hall would not be as simple as he was making it
out to be.</p>
<p>“Yes, we do. Believe in me.” Han Sen saw how nervous she was
getting, and so he told her this with a voice of assurance.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi was a mature woman, and she was the sort who would only
panic when something extremely serious or grave was upon her. She
didn’t scare easy.</p>
<p>Han Sen patted her head like he would a child, which made her
blush. Then, Qu Lanxi said, “We will wait for you in the
forest.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be too far behind; I’ll get this done quick,” Han Sen
said, with confidence.</p>
<p>They trekked back near Qing Ming Shelter, and Han Sen gestured
for her to stay back a little.</p>
<p>“You have to come back alive,” Qu Lanxi pleaded, as she nibbled
her lips.</p>
<p>“I will.” Han Sen smiled and entered the shelter.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s power, even without his super king spirit mode,
he’d be just as strong as Qing Ming Knight. The only problem would
be that Han Sen only had one gene lock open.</p>
<p>And with so many creatures and other spirits around, Han Sen
knew he could not claim the shelter in his current state. But
fortune had smiled on him, and he had a couple of things in his
possession to help even the odds. He had the iron bug beast soul
and the red dagger.</p>
