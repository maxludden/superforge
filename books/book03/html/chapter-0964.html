<p>Han Sen returned from Han Lei’s house with a box of items.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was there, his uncle repeatedly mentioned his
debts. Han Sen eventually gave him some money.</p>
<p>This was not him being nice, though. He wondered if there was
something more of his father’s that might have been hidden from
him. Perhaps the gift of money would prompt his uncle to give it to
him.</p>
<p>Back in his home, Han Sen started to dig through the wares.
There were two jackets, documents, various tools, communicators,
and a smartwatch datapad that was like a wrist-laptop.</p>
<p>After rummaging through the items, Han Sen ultimately came to
the conclusion that there was nothing all that special. Most of the
physical documents were work-related, so there was nothing
revelatory amongst what he had received.</p>
<p>The datapad was forty years old, too, so that had almost zero
monetary value at this point. But that wasn’t where its worth would
lie.</p>
<p>The datapad was the only thing that might harbor the sort of
information he was looking for. Unfortunately, it was
password-protected.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to give Li Xing Lun a call, as he was the sort
of fellow who could crack open encrypted computers and hack into
all sorts of things.</p>
<p>“Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! I’ll be done in ten seconds,” Li
Xing Lun said.</p>
<p>Li Xing Lun established a connection between the datapad and his
PC remotely through Skynet. And almost immediately, it was
unlocked. Three seconds later, though, the datapad exploded.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What the h*ll?!” Li Xing Lun was frozen at the
result.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It wasn’t worth anything, anyway.” Han Sen kept his
smile, but in his chest was a mound of confusion.</p>
<p>“No; this is an A52 Smartwatch Datapad. Why would brute-forcing
its password initiate a self-destruct? Let me get a closer look at
that,” Li Xing Lun said.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened it to nothing. All that remained was the black,
smoldering remains of what it had been.</p>
<p>“Someone must have custom-rigged a self-destruct system inside
it. Unlocking it caused the thing to blow up. I’m so sorry about
this.” Li Xing Lun was feeling guilty.</p>
<p>“That’s okay. It’s nothing important, anyway.” Han Sen didn’t
blame him. It wasn’t his fault, and no one could have expected such
a system to be in-place.</p>
<p>This smartwatch-debacle just made Han Sen more suspicious about
his father.</p>
<p>“The chip is not completely destroyed, though. Perhaps it would
be possible for me to extract some data?” Li Xing Lun really wanted
to help Han Sen, and he continued, “Don’t go anywhere; I’m coming
to see you. Maybe I can recover something!”</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t the wisest when it came to technology. He only
had the knowledge he had been taught in school. As a result, he
didn’t think data recovery would be possible in this case.</p>
<p>But Li Xing Lun was dexterous with technology, and Han Sen
trusted him. If Li Xing Lun said some manner of recovery was
possible, he thought there’d be no harm in allowing him to try.</p>
<p>Two days later, Li Xing Lun arrived at Planet Roca. He took out
the chip and got to work.</p>
<p>Han Sen was quite surprised to see Li Xing Lun work on the
remains of the datapad so intently, and he watched him work on it
day and night for the next few days. Eventually, Li Xing Lun really
did find something.</p>
<p>Of course, because it was damaged, the information was not
complete. But still, there was one sentence of text that really
made Han Sen frown.</p>
<p>“Entering Ancient Hall… practice blood… sutra…”</p>
<p>There were many words missing from the text, but this sentence
was the easiest one to read.</p>
<p>“If I want to enter the Ancient Hall, do I need to practice
Blood-Pulse Sutra? Is that what this is implying?” Han Sen’s
confusion was only becoming greater.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but this is all I could do for you.” Li Xing Lun was
still remorseful over blowing up the laptop. And he felt even
worse, not being able to recover as much as he had hoped to.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry; you’ve done enough. Thanks a lot for the help,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know why his father had left behind this
datapad, but obviously, someone did not want Han Sen or anyone else
finding out what was inside it.</p>
<p>After Li Xing Lun departed, Han Sen researched what he could
about the existence of Ancient Hall. It was still just a myth,
though. There was no factual evidence supporting its existence.</p>
<p>As a result, Han Sen was unable to find out much from humans.
What he did find out, though, was where the myth of the Ancient
Hall originated from.</p>
<p>It was from the shura. The myth said that the Ancient Hall was
where the deities or gods of the shura resided. It was a forbidden
place for the shura to go, and only their kings were able to visit
there, sometime before their death.</p>
<p>It was like a tomb for the monarchs of the shura. If shura kings
died outside the hall, they must be left where they were, as no
else could enter the hall.</p>
<p>Of course, this information was only obtained from Skynet. And
Han Sen could still not find any information on the Ancient Hall’s
whereabouts. But he did find two pieces of information on the
hall’s architecture; it was said to be a palace built from stone,
and outside it stood a shura statue.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unsure whether or not the Ancient Hall in the
extracted data was the one associated with the shura, though.
Something could have been lost in translation, and there was no way
for him to know for sure.</p>
<p>“But if these two Ancient Halls are indeed the same, why would
my father have an association with it?” Han Sen, once again, was
confused.</p>
<p>He knew he himself was a human, but there was one person who he
wasn’t quite sure about.</p>
<p>If his great-grandfather was Han Jingzhi, and if Zero’s identity
had something to do with Blood Legion, things could become
muddy.</p>
<p>“What happened to the Han family, in the past?” Han Sen
destroyed the rest of the chip, so no one else could ever read what
was written.</p>
<p>He was not strong enough to investigate these matters alone, and
there still wasn’t enough to go on. But once he had the appropriate
leads, and his power had grown, he’d follow it through to the end.
But whatever happened, he still acknowledged he couldn’t let
himself get too deep into these affairs. He might eventually find
himself unable to return.</p>
