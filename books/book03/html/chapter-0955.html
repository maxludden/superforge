<h2>The Strongest Skill</h2>
<h3>Chapter 955</h3>

<p>Odin’s Eye could expose a target’s weakest point, and it was not
like the Falsified-Sky Sutra. Han Sen had his own method of
evaluating his opponents, though, through his Dongxuan Sutra. He
used it trace his foe’s attacks and effectively block each one.</p>
<p>Fighting Liu Meng was not easy. He was around the same level as
Han Sen, and he was exceptionally talented. Since he was unable to
break through Liu Meng’s defense, Han Sen knew victory would not
come easy when it was his turn to attack.</p>
<p>Despite the underlying complexities of each fighter, the fight
was simple to watch. When one attacked, the other blocked with
absolute perfection and vice versa. Right now, it was Han Sen’s
turn to defend, and after a half hour long barrage of attacks, Liu
Meng could not damage his opponent in the slightest.</p>
<p>“I have heard he has learnt Heavenly Go from the Huangfu family.
I see now that it is true.” Green frowned.</p>
<p>Han Sen blocked every one of Liu Meng’s attacks, despite their
power. The moves Liu Meng performed against Han Sen had been taught
to him by a demigod, and under the effect of Odin’s Eye, they were
executed flawlessly.</p>
<p>He could use any skill perfectly, as a matter of fact. Whether
it was a righteous skill or an evil one, Liu Meng could use it.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the battlers switched and Han Sen was the
one to start attacking. But just like before, he was unable to
overcome Odin’s Eye.</p>
<p>By now, they had been gone a long time. The other party-goers,
noticing their absence, wandered around in search of them.</p>
<p>One person, seeing that the light in the training room was on,
curiously peeked inside and found them.</p>
<p>The news of this fight spread like wildfire, and people came in
droves to watch.</p>
<p>One would attack and the other would defend. Their fighting
skills were incredible, but it shocked the onlookers to see Liu
Meng unable to penetrate Han Sen’s defense.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fists, when he attacked, came in simple. It was Han
Sen’s signature skill, Sonic-Thunder Punch. It wasn’t the
same-old-same-old, however. Han Sen was switching up his formation
a lot, and that had a knock-on effect to the display of his
skill.</p>
<p>Still, it was not enough to damage Liu Meng.</p>
<p>Both of them swapped between attack and defense many times, and
a decisive victor seemed impossible to decide.</p>
<p>Compared to the ferocity of their initial fighting, though,
things started to change. They had slowed down in fatigue, but
neither was tired enough to drop their guard.</p>
<p>The audience had been there a long time now, too. Their
excitement had long since depleted, and a few people had even gone
to sleep.</p>
<p>After five hours of battling, there had been no progress.
Annie’s butt had gotten numb.</p>
<p>“I have already prepared rooms for the guests. Come with me,”
the housekeeper announced.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank heavens.” People had grown tired of watching them
fight.</p>
<p>Most went off with the housekeeper the instant he appeared, but
quite a few stayed. A few hours later, that changed. After more and
more people left, only Annie remained.</p>
<p>They may as well have been shooting free throws in basketball,
except neither of them had scored a point the entire time. The
initially enthralling spectacle of their combat had long since lost
its excitement, and the two were a mind-numbing bore to observe
now.</p>
<p>And after all that time had elapsed, neither had been able to
inflict the slightest damage to the other. Their defenses were
impenetrable.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Liu Meng, by this point, were gasping and sweating.
Their exhaustion had slowed down their fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist, which once gleamed like suns of electricity,
only produced minor sparks. Liu Meng only had his bare fists left
to fight with.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Their knuckles collided with each other, shaking off droplets of
sweat as they coursed through the air.</p>
<p>It was midnight by now, and still, the fight limped on. Soon
after, their movements were twisted and neither of the two could
stand upright.</p>
<p>Neither of them wanted to concede, though, and their will was
all that kept them going.</p>
<p>Their attacks, being much weaker than before, were easier to
block.</p>
<p>“That Taia sword is mine!” Han Sen declared.</p>
<p>Liu Meng’s body was extremely fatigued, and he had exited Odin’s
Eye a long time ago.</p>
<p>Liu Meng, unable to dodge Han Sen’s next attack, was thrown to
the ground.</p>
<p>With an opening before him, Han Sen climbed on top and
repeatedly punched Liu Meng in the face.</p>
<p>“No, I’m going to win!” Liu Meng managed to get Han Sen off of
him. Kicking him away, it was his turn to mount Han Sen and punch
his face in.</p>
<p>The once delicate exhibition of combat by two highly-trained
individuals had swiftly turned into a drunken bar brawl.</p>
<p>“Are you guys done?” Annie could not watch anymore, and so she
stood up and left.</p>
<p>She knew that with both of their stamina being what it was,
neither would end up dealing considerable amounts of damage to the
other. It was practically over.</p>
<p>With Lan Te’s housekeeper there to keep an eye on the
proceedings, she knew everything would be all right after she
left.</p>
<p>“Friend, I don’t think our bet is going to present the results
either of us want,” Zhuo Donglai said.</p>
<p>“Han Sen should be proud of his ability to fight with my
grandson like this.” While what Green said was graceful, he was
sweating on the inside. He did not expect Han Sen to be able to
fight Liu Meng to this point.</p>
<p>“I’m going to rest. I have no interest watching kids quarrel on
the ground,” Zhuo Donglai said.</p>
<p>“Walk with me.” Green left.</p>
<p>In the training room, both were writhing on the ground. They
were sopping wet as if they had both been for a swim.</p>
<p>“I have a skill I have not used yet. Had I used it, I would have
won a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“I have a skill that’s more powerful than your skill. It’s
super-secret, but you’d have lost immediately, had I used it.”</p>
<p>“I have a skill that would kick your skill’s butt.”</p>
<p>“I have a skill that is so so so so so much more powerful than
your skill. It’s the strongest skill, and I could kill you with
ease.”</p>
<p>They were both on the ground, and the only thing that seemed to
fight now were their mouths.</p>
