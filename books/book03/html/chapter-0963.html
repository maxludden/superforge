<h3>Chapter 963</h3>

<p>“D*mn The King! I’m going to kill him!” The next day,
Thunder-Devil King’s rage reached new heights. It was likely the
entirety of Thorn Forest could hear his furious screams.</p>
<p>By now, Han Sen had already safely returned to the underground
shelter. He grew the mushroom and his orchid in secret, behind his
garden.</p>
<p>“Daddy! Daddy!” When Bao’er saw Han Sen return, she spared no
time crawling towards him. She climbed up to his neck and gave him
a kiss.</p>
<p>“Did you behave while I was gone?” Han Sen was happy.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Bao’er said.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought her back with him to the palace. When he
arrived, he was shocked to see that the place looked like a ruin.
Trash was littered everywhere, and in the midst of it all was Zero,
cleaning.</p>
<p>Many of the things Han Sen had brought back with him from the
Alliance had been destroyed, including his softest mattress.</p>
<p>When Han Sen witnessed the sight, he asked Zero with much
concern, “What happened here?”</p>
<p>Zero looked at Bao’er and said one word. “Her.”</p>
<p>Bao’er kissed Han Sen’s cheek and said, “I was good.”</p>
<p>He had only been gone for two days, and yet, in that short
amount of time she had managed to ruin the palace. If he had been
gone any longer, he feared the entire shelter might have been
destroyed.</p>
<p>“Just throw it all out. We’ll go buy some new stuff.” Han Sen
took them both to the Alliance, so they could purchase replacement
furniture and such.</p>
<p>They could have bought it all on Skynet, but by walking around
the shops themselves, they could get a better look at the furniture
and feel how solid each piece was.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked excited the entire time, while Zero was quiet and
seemingly uninterested.</p>
<p>“Sir, this supermarket has a room for toddlers. Would you like
to make use of it and leave your child there for the duration of
your shopping trip?” One of the workers in the store stepped
forward to ask Han Sen.</p>
<p>“No, that’s okay.” Although the room for kids was free, Han Sen
had no idea what she would do in his absence. Without being under
his watchful eye, she might destroy the room or even hurt the other
babies.</p>
<p>They went over to where they sold mattresses and checked out the
airbeds there. They were the easiest to carry and most suitable for
life in the sanctuaries.</p>
<p>“Sir, this airbed uses the latest technology. It is very
suitable for the skin of babies. Perhaps you should give it a try?”
the salesman said.</p>
<p>“Um, no thank you.” An image of Han Sen’s old bed flashed
through his mind, and knowing that the small child in his arms had
caused the destruction, he wasn’t willing to risk a repeat there in
the store.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You won’t be held accountable, even if there is
damage,” the salesman said, smiling.</p>
<p>After the second request, Han Sen cautiously placed Bao’er down
on the airbed.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, is this good?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>She looked excited, and she brought her hands down on the bed
gleefully.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The airbed exploded before them, and Han Sen quickly pulled her
back.</p>
<p>“Oh my God! Is your daughter okay? I’m so sorry for this!” the
salesman apologized, as a manager approached them.</p>
<p>“We apologize for that, sir. Please be sure that we will pay the
medical bills for any treatment your daughter needs,” the manager
said, with obvious concern.</p>
<p>“That’s okay. How much is this bed? I’ll buy it,” Han Sen said,
smiling.</p>
<p>The manager did not want Han Sen to pay anything, so they gave
it to him for free and even provided him with a few lottery
vouchers.</p>
<p>It was difficult to explain what had happened, so Han Sen did
not argue and accepted all they offered him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to use the vouchers, but the prizes
attracted Bao’er. Many of the items that were up for grabs were
toys.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” When Han Sen entered the entertainment section,
someone called out his name. He turned around and saw that it was
his second uncle Han Lei.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not hate the Han family members, per se, but he was
not fond of them either.</p>
<p>They hadn’t done anything too despicable, and Han Sen had so
many dangerous enemies that he didn’t have time to waste on ill
thoughts of the Han family, anyway.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s father used to manage the family’s company, but the
company was owned exclusively by the other members of the family.
Han Sen’s father was given no shares of the business.</p>
<p>Strangely, they had no idea they owned it until after Han Sen’s
father died. And after the ordeal, they sold the company to Starry
Group.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s father used to say he and Han Sen owed the Han family,
so Han Sen did not really have to hate them. Still, he preferred to
treat them as strangers.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, are you buying stuff from here?” Han Lei looked on Han
Sen with a slight awkwardness. This was probably due to how the man
had mistreated Han Sen and his mother in the past. Now that Han Sen
was famous, and had even managed to defeat a royal shura and become
the president’s son-in-law, they had been quite rightfully served
humble pie.</p>
<p>If they had treated Han Sen better in the past, he could have
helped them a great deal. Now, that was unlikely.</p>
<p>“I’m done, and I am gone,” Han Sen said, and prepared to
leave.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen didn’t dwell on what had happened in the past,
he still preferred having no contact with the Han family.</p>
<p>Han Lei said, “My brother left something in the company; if you
want, I can give it to you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Just some private belongings he left behind. Some clothing and
communicators, things like that,” Han Lei said.</p>
<p>“I’ll claim them when you are free next.” Han Sen could not be
bothered asking why they had not mentioned this before, but the
less talk, the better.</p>
<p>“I am free now. You should come over and take them.” Han Lei
smiled.</p>
