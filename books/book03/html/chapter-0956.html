<h2>A Letter Without Words</h2>
<h3>Chapter 956</h3>

<p>The next day, as Han Sen and Annie were leaving, Liu Meng was
nowhere to be seen. His face had been beaten and bruised. Thinking
it wasn’t appropriate for the young scion of the Lan Te family to
be seen in such a state, the housekeeper accompanied them on their
exit.</p>
<p>Before they boarded the starship, the housekeeper gave a gift to
Han Sen and Annie each. He told them they were gifts from Liu
Meng.</p>
<p>After sitting down and unwrapping her gift, Annie was taken
aback by the presence of sparkling jewelry within. They had been
created by the finest of craftsmen of the Alliance.</p>
<p>Upon opening his box, Han Sen was greeted with the sword he had
fought Liu Meng for. The broken sword named Taia was within.</p>
<p>“Why were you given a copper sword?” Annie did not know about
the significance of this sword, and she merely believed it to be a
relic or artpiece.</p>
<p>“This is was at the crux of our gambit.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you won the fight?” Annie didn’t really care
much, but she still asked to make conversation.</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>Liu Meng did not open his third gene lock for the duration of
the fight, and Han Sen did not use his super king spirit mode.
Neither of them broke the defense of the other, and it resulted in
a stalemate. Nobody won.</p>
<p>Liu Meng had more geno points than Han Sen. If Han Sen had as
many mutant and sacred-blood geno points as Liu Ming did, he would
have defeated him without issue. With strength like that, he could
obliterate Odin’s Eye.</p>
<p>But that would also result in it being a life or death fight; a
fatality could easily occur. And seeing as they weren’t actually
enemies, Han Sen saw no reason to push Liu Meng so far.</p>
<p>Annie didn’t ask any more questions about the gift he had
received. She didn’t know the nature of it, and neither was she
really interested. She believed it to be a nice little decoration,
and she was content in thinking that.</p>
<p>Picking up the sword, Han Sen saw an envelope lying below it.
When Han Sen opened it, there was a plain white parchment inside
with no text on it. It was empty.</p>
<p>“Why is there nothing written on it?” Annie asked.</p>
<p>“Who knows.” Han Sen crumpled the paper in his fist and
incinerated it with a fire born of his hands. Then he looked to the
stars in the sky.</p>
<p>When he arrived home, he examined the Taia sword with greater
care. The handle was not its original, and he noticed it had been
forged of z-steel. It had later been plated with the copper scales
of some beast. All-in-all, it seemed to match the blade well.</p>
<p>The copper sword looked a little red, and it looked rough. The
tip of the broken blade was craggy and vicious-looking.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel the lifeforce in the sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave it a swing and appreciated the feel he got from it.
Still, it wasn’t perfect. The blade was not complete, and as such,
it lacked the precise balance the most exceptional blades typically
possessed.</p>
<p>“The other half of this blade belongs to the Qin family. Even if
I managed to retrieve it, it’d be useless. It’s harder than
z-steel, so how in the sanctuaries would I be able to reforge it?
Still, there’s always the possibility I could forge a whole other
sword with the other half. Then, by dual-wielding, I could use Dual
Fly sword skills.” For now, Han Sen was going to use Taia and the
red dagger. After giving it a quick go, they felt good in his
hands. He was comfortable using them.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen went to the Saint Hall community in search
of a fire hyper geno art.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before he saw an S-Class skill named “Phoenix.”
Without hesitation, he bought it.</p>
<p>It was not too dissimilar from Phoenix King’s phoenix body. It
was a protective skill that required Nirvana for its learning.</p>
<p>Han Sen, of course, did not need that. His proficiency with the
fire element was exceptional, and he could merely simulate Phoenix
King’s energy flow for the direct practice of Phoenix.</p>
<p>As expected, Han Sen learnt it with ease. He figured it would
not be long before he could use it in combat.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to return to Thorn Shelter, with Annie’s bow
in-hand once again. Although Thorn Shelter had not decided to
retaliate, their presence there was still a concern.</p>
<p>To weaken them further, Han Sen planned to assassinate as many
creatures as he could.</p>
<p>Heading through the forest, Han Sen wanted to pay Tie Yi a visit
first. He wanted to learn more about Thorn Shelter.</p>
<p>Before he reached Fish Valley, he saw the bodies of many
creatures strewn about, and many more creatures locked in combat
with one-another.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened here?” Han Sen quickly hid his presence
and snuck closer to get a look at what was going on.</p>
<p>“Caw!” A golden bird flew across the battlefield, unleashing a
barrage of wind blades to slay many of the creatures down
below.</p>
<p>“Tie Yi?” Han Sen saw Tie Yi fighting a creature, and he was
heavily injured.</p>
<p>Making use of Taia, Han Sen sprung forward to severe the head of
a primitive creature from its body.</p>
<p>“Tie Yi, what happened here?” Han Sen asked, while holding
him.</p>
<p>“The Holy-Flame King lost the war. Thunder-King took Nine-Wish
Mountain. Thunder-King’s son, Thunder-Devil King, is coming. Thorn
Shelter is done for,” Tie Yi painfully explained.</p>
<p>“Thunder-Devil King?” Han Sen had once killed him in the spirit
base, much to the spirit’s embarrassment. He found it difficult to
believe that same spirit was now trying to conquer this area.</p>
<p>“I signed a contract with the baron. I can’t leave, even if it
results in my death on this battlefield. If you want your people to
survive what is to come, lead them into the forest and never look
back,” Tie Yi mournfully said.</p>
<p>“Stay here and hide. Get to safety. I’m going to try and take
her spirit stone. If I do that, you will be free.” Han Sen took Tie
Yi to a hidden location.</p>
<p>“Don’t go! Thunder-Devil King is much stronger than Thorn Baron.
Thorn Shelter is lost,” Tie Yi said.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back.” Han Sen snuck towards Thorn Shelter.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept his presence hidden, and no creature across the
battlefield was alerted to his coming. He killed a few that were
close to seeing him, and soon arrived at Thorn Shelter.</p>
