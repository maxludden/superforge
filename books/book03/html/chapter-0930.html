<p>“Ridiculous!” Hearing what Han Sen said, The King of Day could
do nothing but scoff indignantly.</p>
<p>Phoenix King took the jive calmly, though. He was not swayed by
what Han Sen said, and merely responded, “This is good. Perhaps
that is what we should do; of course, the reality will be the
reverse. I kill you, and then you proceed to kill yourself
ninety-nine times. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Then it is settled.” Han Sen smiled, as he let out a holy light
that enveloped him.</p>
<p>Phoenix King’s body kicked up a blaze of golden flames, instead.
The shadow of a newly arisen phoenix could faintly be seen, behind
the curtain of fire that wreathed the spirit. The array of tall
flames was a mesmerizing sight, like a fountain of molten gold.</p>
<p>“Phoenix Body sure puts the envy into all who look upon it,” The
King of Day said, not even attempting to hide his own jealousy of
the power.</p>
<p>Each member of the audience of spirits had their mouths agape
and eyes wide. They felt pride in being allowed to witness the
casting of Phoenix Body.</p>
<p>Phoenix King had spent many years in the first and second spirit
bases. He had never lost once, and he was a supremely powerful
spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at him and merely swung his fist.</p>
<p>Phoenix King threw a fist of his own in retaliation. The gold
flames that surged around his fist turned into the shape of a
fire-born phoenix, and it carried the knuckles forward with
tremendous force.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist collided with the phoenix and broke it. His fist
did not stop there, however, and onwards it went. His fist surged
through the air and walloped Phoenix King.</p>
<p>The bird and the flames that surrounded Phoenix King were
shattered by the mystic power that fueled Han Sen’s fist.</p>
<p>But in the next second, the golden flames tightened around
Phoenix King’s body and were renewed like the summoning of fiery
armor. He was undamaged, as if he had not suffered the power of
that punch.</p>
<p>“Phoenix King is good, but there’s no denying how powerful The
King is, too. Did you see his phoenix-shape shatter?” Heavenly
Empress commented.</p>
<p>The King of Day was happy, and he said, “Ha, even The King’s
power is null against Phoenix King. The King is done for this
time.”</p>
<p>Flower Empress wore a complicated look, and clearly waged an
internal battle of conflicting opinions. She wanted The King to
lose, but not grievously. She almost wanted him to win.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not relent in his attacks. Fist after fist hammered
against Phoenix King’s body, and while each time the fires were
quelled, they’d be reborn to protect their caster before another
fist could land.</p>
<p>No matter how much power Han Sen put into his attacks, Phoenix
King shrugged each of them off. Still, no damage was dealt to the
Phoenix Body.</p>
<p>Phoenix King merely stood there, not even attempting to dodge
Han Sen’s attacks. He looked at his opponent with disdain, as punch
after punch was thrown against him.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. You cannot harm me. Suicide now, and save us all
the trouble and wait,” Phoenix coldly said.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled at Phoenix in return, saying, “I’ll admit I’m
impressed. That’s a fire element skill, right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t compare the grace of my Phoenix Body with that of
ordinary fire. Mine is a holy flame, it is pure and it is
ultimate.” Phoenix’s face was stuffed with gross pride as he
spoke.</p>
<p>The spirits that watched the fight looked on him in admiration.
They were in awe of Phoenix Body’s might.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “You make it sound unbeatable, but we
all know everything has its weakness. Fire is fire, and fire
doesn’t get along with water too well.”</p>
<p>“You don’t control the powers of water, boy,” Phoenix said with
a mocking tone.</p>
<p>The water element was still harmless against Phoenix King.
Ordinary watery attacks were not able to suppress the flames of the
phoenix.</p>
<p>The King of Day joined-in on the mocking and said, “Cut the
crap! Even if you did wield water elemental powers, they would do
nothing. Stop wasting our time.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored The King of Day and continued to focus on
Phoenix King. He said, “Who told you I’m not attuned with the
element of water?”</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out his arm and opened the palm of his hand.
Frosty air was summoned to encompass it, and it grew stronger and
stronger into a fierce blizzard, until it eventually consumed
him.</p>
<p>“I thought he was physical-only?” Everyone was shocked at this
revelation, unable to believe Han Sen was using the power of
ice.</p>
<p>“Was he hiding his true power, after all this time? I mean, he
was already beating each and every one of us he faced.” Even The
King of Day was taken aback.</p>
<p>“No. This is not his true power; it actually seems weaker,”
Heavenly Empress stated.</p>
<p>“You mean to say that power doesn’t actually belong to him?”
Flower Empress asked.</p>
<p>Phoenix King looked on Han Sen with disdain, saying, “This power
does not belong to you. You cannot make it effective! Not even this
power can bring me harm.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then are you willing to accept one of these punches?”
Han Sen did not wait for a response, and simply threw a fist out
towards Phoenix King.</p>
<p>The icy powers were learnt from Little Fairy in the Second God’s
Sanctuary. He had only opened its first gene lock, so it was indeed
weaker than what it could have been. It was visibly so, in the eyes
of others.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Little Fairy’s powers were special, but he planned
on doing more than just using her powers. He had more than a few
aces up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Almost at the same moment, Han Sen simulated Little Silver’s
power. The frosty air crackled with the charge of brutal
electricity, not too unlike the Water-Thunder skill he had just
learnt.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist was shrouded in biting clouds; the same clouds
that masked much of his body.</p>
<p>Phoenix King’s power and speed were not as good as Han Sen’s, so
the spirit’s Phoenix Flame attack could not hurt him.</p>
<p>They had been at a stalemate, in which Han Sen could not be
damaged and Han Sen could not damage the spirit with his holy
light. Thus far, Phoenix King had only been so cocky and boisterous
because of the Phoenix Body talent he possessed. He had an
indestructible body, and he wanted people to know that.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist collided with Phoenix King’s fire-wreathed
body.</p>
