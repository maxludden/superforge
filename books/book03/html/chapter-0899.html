<h2>Taming the Wind Beast</h2>
<h3>Chapter 899</h3>

<p>Han Sen came up with an idea of what to do. People often got
close with creatures by pretending to be them. After doing so for a
while, they would often end up adopting their smell. This lent them
credibility with the animal, and helped the animal to acknowledge
them as one of its own.</p>
<p>This method wouldn’t work on the wind beast, but Han Sen had a
better idea on how to make the wolf think he was the same type of
creature. What’s more, Han Sen was the only person who could use
this method.</p>
<p>With dongxuan aura, he simulated the wolf’s energy flow so that
they would be the same. Then, Han Sen inched closer to the wolf.
Much to his delight, the wolf’s hostility seemed to have
subsided.</p>
<p>This brought Han Sen much joy, and after realizing the success
of this method, he made sure to simulate the wolf’s energy flow
each day. Although it was still alert to Han Sen, given what he had
done to it, the wolf’s concern grew less each day.</p>
<p>A month later, the wind beast was no longer hostile. Even
without the coins, he would not attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>When Han Sen did not simulate the energy flow, the wind wolf did
not attack him then, either.</p>
<p>But it only accepted Han Sen. Every time the wind beast saw Qu
Lanxi or Chu Ming, it showed great interest in attacking them. So,
Han Sen built a little house for the wind beast to live in.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued practicing his dongxuan aura, taming the
creature more and more each day. He hoped to one day hunt alongside
it in Thorn Forest, and hoped that day would come soon.</p>
<p>The waterdrops he collected were almost all used up, and it
wouldn’t be long before he’d used them all. He needed to find more
geno plants soon, otherwise, his Blood-Pine would stop growing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the second month, the wind beast had learnt to
adhere to Han Sen’s commands. And by listening to Han Sen, it would
not attack other people.</p>
<p>“You really tamed it? You really tamed the wind beast?” Chu Ming
said to Han Sen as he looked at wind beast. He couldn’t believe
it.</p>
<p>“Yeah. How lucky am I, eh?” Han Sen was feeling pretty smug,
especially since he had trumped a spirit and become the only person
capable of taming such a ferocious beast.</p>
<p>“How? How in the sanctuaries did you do that?” Qu Lanxi asked
with much shock, as she too stared at the wind beast. It was an
ordinary beast that had unlocked four gene locks. It was as
powerful as Qing Ming Knight himself.</p>
<p>Yu Yan Knight had tried to tame it for the longest time, using
everything he knew. They found it difficult to comprehend how Han
Sen had managed to do it in only two months.</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s all down to talent, really.” Han Sen had no
genuine excuse, but no matter what, he wasn’t going to tell them
about his ability to simulate energy flows.</p>
<p>“I am bringing Little Wind to Thorn Forest with me, so I’ll be
gone for the next couple of days. Don’t fret for my well-being.”
Han Sen could not wait to enter that knotted domain.</p>
<p>The waterdrops had almost all run out, after all. The
Blood-Vine’s waterdrops had been rationed, and its speed of growth
had slowed down considerably.</p>
<p>“You may have Little Wind by your side, but you yourself are
still fairly weak. Isn’t it a little risky for you to go to Thorn
Forest right now?” Chu Ming expressed concern.</p>
<p>“It may be risky, but I have no other choice. With the spirit
ruling us, such drastic times call for drastic measures,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“I’m going with you,” Qu Lanxi suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Lanxi!” Chu Ming and Han Sen exclaimed in shock, both at the
same time.</p>
<p>“Let me scout the vicinity out first. If I can confirm it to be
a safe enough area for us to venture there together, I will bring
you there,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi said, “Then you will be risking it all, all by
yourself. How can we sit idly by, while you risk life and limb for
us? I can’t let you go there alone, it wouldn’t be right.”</p>
<p>“Then let us all go there together!” Chu Ming said, firming his
jaw.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi shook her head and said, “No, you should stay here and
take care of the garden. If we emerge from Thorn Forest without the
rewards we seek, this will be our backup.”</p>
<p>Chu Ming looked as if he wanted to say something more, but she
cut off whatever he was about to say. “My powers are best put to
use in Thorn Forest. Don’t complain or try to stop me; I am
going.”</p>
<p>Chu Ming’s mouth just hung open, and he did not say anything.
Although he did not express it, he seemed to agree with what she
had said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious as to what power she was referring to. He
only knew Chu Ming had certain fire abilities, but Qu Lanxi was
still a bit of an enigma to him.</p>
<p>Regardless of what powers she had, though, she had only opened
her first gene lock. Han Sen didn’t believe she could help out
much, in their time there. He would have bid for her to remain at
the house, but she was too stubborn, and he knew it would be futile
to protest her accompaniment.</p>
<p>It was far more difficult for humans to open gene locks than it
was for creatures. Surpasser humans traditionally only had a
fitness level of three hundred. Unless you were super talented,
opening a second gene lock would be next to impossible.</p>
<p>According to the Alliance’s research, the ordinary fitness of a
human allowed for only one opened gene lock for every three hundred
fitness.</p>
<p>That meant humans required a fitness of six hundred to open
their second gene lock.</p>
<p>But for surpassers, reaching a fitness level of six hundred
wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>One hundred normal geno points could increase a person’s fitness
by one hundred. One hundred ordinary geno points could increase a
person’s fitness by two hundred.</p>
<p>That meant a surpasser would have to max out both their normal
geno points and ordinary geno points to reach a fitness level of
six hundred and open their second gene lock.</p>
<p>If they were lucky, they could gain mutant geno points and
sacred-blood geno points. If they did, opening gene locks would be
easier.</p>
<p>One hundred mutant geno points could supply a person four
hundred additional levels of fitness. Maxing out sacred-blood geno
points increased a person’s fitness by eight hundred. As for super
geno points? No one knew.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi and Chu Ming had only maxed out their normal geno
points. They did not have many ordinary geno points, and so it
didn’t seem likely they had opened their second gene locks.</p>
<p>Han Sen had an advantage over them. His dongxuan aura had
already almost reached the second tier, and it wouldn’t be long
before he could unlock it.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I may have only opened my first gene lock, but I
won’t slow you down. I’ll prove more useful than you might expect,”
Qu Lanxi said.</p>
<p>“Do you mind telling me what powers you have?” They were about
to venture into a realm where the possibility of death resided
behind every corner; he had no choice but to ask.</p>
<p>“Scent. My power is that of scent,” Qu Lanxi said.</p>
<p>“Scent? What kind of power is that?” Han Sen looked shocked,
having never heard of this before.</p>
