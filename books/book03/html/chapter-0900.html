<h2>Flaming Porcupine</h2>
<h3>Chapter 900</h3>

<p>“I can mask our scent, robbing the creatures that could locate
us through our scent of their abilities to find us. Furthermore, I
can detect the faint traces and scents of those that have gone
before us. I can read the area,” Qu Lanxi explained to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. Her abilities did not lend themselves to
combat proficiency, but they would be extremely useful, all the
same.</p>
<p>She would undoubtedly prove valuable on the trip he was
planning. There was no discernible reason for Han Sen to deny her
presence, following this revelation. So, he planned to go with
her.</p>
<p>The ability to erase one’s scent was an incredible talent to
possess; otherwise, creatures could find, stalk, and attack you
with greater ease.</p>
<p>The next day, Han Sen took Qu Lanxi with him to the forest. Han
Sen was a little anxious, almost flat-out worried, about venturing
there. He wasn’t powerful enough to compete with what was said to
lurk beneath the knotted boughs and tangled roots of that domain.
The entire place was veiled with mystery and tales of anguish.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the wind beast at his side, Han Sen wouldn’t
even have dreamed of going there at his current stage of
development.</p>
<p>The duo had now now walked half a kilometer beyond the edge of
the forest. At this stage of their journey, Han Sen discovered his
first wild geno plant. When Qu Lanxi wasn’t looking, he absorbed
the plant.</p>
<p>With the wind wolf leading their way, Han Sen managed to absorb
a dozen such plants. They made for quite the prize.</p>
<p>They were only at the edge of the forest, yet the grass was
overgrown and impeded their travel. The foliage was thick and
coarse, and the trees grew tall and menacing.</p>
<p>It was said that further-into the forest, the thorns of the
forest’s namesake would reveal themselves. Spiked vines and woods
would choke all paths, and the creatures would be far more numerous
and threatening. They weren’t in too deep yet, so there was no
immediate danger.</p>
<p>But suddenly, Little Wind stopped. It began to growl, in a
signal of warning.</p>
<p>Han Sen comforted the beast and used his dongxuan aura to scan
the vicinity. His ability had its limits, however, and so he
couldn’t detect whatever Little Wind was trying to draw his
attention to. It wasn’t too close.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi’s eyes burned like molten silver, though. She looked
around and said, “I can detect the remnants of a scent, left by a
creature around eight hours ago. There were two of them, as a
matter of fact.”</p>
<p>“Can you discern which creature came by?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, no. I have never smelled such a scent before, so
I don’t know what could have left it,” Qu Lanxi answered.</p>
<p>Little Wind stayed alert, however, and its fur straightened and
stood up on end. Han Sen knew that a dangerous creature had to be
around somewhere, so he brought his companions with him to hide in
the midst of a few bushes.</p>
<p>As they did this, Qu Lanxi used her scent-masking ability.
Unless the creatures saw them directly, they’d be difficult to
detect.</p>
<p>After a short wait, the brush on the edge of a glade began to
rustle. A metallic red porcupine revealed itself.</p>
<p>“And so, we have already come across our first ordinary
creature. I can only wonder how many gene locks it has opened.” Han
Sen scanned the porcupine, and noticed its lifeforce was almost as
strong as that of Little Wind.</p>
<p>The porcupine came out of the bushes and went towards a tree.
Then, it began to burrow beneath it. It unearthed some subterranean
fungi and started eating them ravenously.</p>
<p>“Wait here. We’re off to go kill it.” Han Sen was excited to see
a lonely, ordinary creature.</p>
<p>“Be careful, okay?” Qu Lanxi was nervous, and cared for Han
Sen’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>Han Sen allowed Little Wind to wait where he was, and snuck
behind the porcupine by himself. His basics hadn’t left him yet,
and so he used one of his assassination talents to approach
undetected. When he was three meters away, the porcupine was still
enjoying its meal, blissfully unaware of its nearing aggressor.</p>
<p>When he was two meters away, Han Sen suddenly fired a coin onto
the porcupine.</p>
<p>The porcupine instantly became enraged. It turned around and
looked at Han Sen with fiery eyes, and its spikes straightened out
with a desire to kill. Like a projectile, one of the spikes was
fired straight at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast dongxuan aura and evaded the spike successfully—it
was going for his face.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The spike drove through a tree, then bounced off of a second
tree and fell down to the ground.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the Third God’s Sanctuary was stronger than
the vegetation of the Second God’s Sanctuary. In order to pierce
through a tree, the force of the spike was horrible.</p>
<p>The porcupine ran towards Han Sen with the speed of a sportscar.
If Han Sen was unfortunate enough to be caught in the roll of that
porcupine’s spikes, he’d be very dead.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a formation, and with an analysis of the
environment, circled the porcupine.</p>
<p>Little Wind came charging forward, a blistering gust of wind
whipping from its mouth. Its gaping maw suddenly became a cannon,
one that was primed and ready to fire at the porcupine.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The cannonball of wind could only be cast if the creature had
successfully opened its fourth gene lock. The air cannon’s
ammunition was like a bomb, and hit the porcupine with tremendous
force. Many of the spikes were ripped away by the wind, peeling the
skin as they went. The porcupine was bleeding.</p>
<p>The porcupine spared no time to tend to its wounds, so it just
looked at Little Wind and screamed at it. The spikes of its back
suddenly burst into flames, and like bullets, rapidly fired towards
the wolf.</p>
<p>Little Wind did not move away to avoid the incoming projectiles,
however. It stood its ground and howled to create a flurry of wind
that blew away all the spikes. Not a single scratch was dealt to
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen fired another coin at the porcupine, and since it was
distracted by Little Wind, it did not dodge. Its speed was reduced
immediately, hindered by the crushing weight each coin dealt.</p>
<p>Little Wind opened its mouth and fired his air cannon again, and
after the porcupine had been slowed down by the coins that kept
hitting it, it was unable to evade that, either.</p>
<p>Through the cooperative efforts of Han Sen and Little Wind, the
porcupine was rendered paralyzed. It could not move. Little Wind
fired a few more cannonballs of wind, and for the finisher, Han Sen
brought down his Sonic-Thunder Punch on the porcupine’s head.</p>
