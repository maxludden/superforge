<h2>Naive Spirit Brother</h2>
<h3>Chapter 913</h3>

<p>Flame Giant’s behavior was quite amusing, at first. But now, it
had grown annoying. Ignoring him, Han Sen decided to fly his island
to others in order to challenge their residing spirits and obtain
more spirit geno points.</p>
<p>Many islands, however, did not contain spirits. Han Sen had to
fly around for quite a while, observing empty islands with no
spirits on them. When he did find a spirit, he was dismayed to
learn that they had no rank, and he therefore couldn’t challenge
them.</p>
<p>Flame Giant was not keen to lose the spirit of his affection,
however, and so he followed Han Sen like a puppy. As they traveled,
he would frequently announce to the islands around them, “Hail to
The King! The King has come; submit an offering of geno points to
him.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, thinking Flame Giant’s behavior was both
pointless and annoying. If the spirits did not invite him to
battle, he couldn’t fight them even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>But what happened next shocked Han Sen. The first spirit they
came to, upon hearing Han Sen was the The King, knelt. And just as
Flame Giant did earlier, he showed great reverence and adoration
for Han Sen who was before him.</p>
<p>He invited Han Sen to challenge, and when the fight started, he
did nothing. He stood there and offered his own defeat without
contest. It almost made Han Sen feel rather bad.</p>
<p>“You have to take my geno points, my king.” The spirit’s tone of
voice was so firm and resolute, it sounded as if it was a genuine
honor to provide Han Sen his geno points.</p>
<p>“If you want to give me your points that badly, I will take them
then.” Han Sen then punched the spirit to death, as a blue light
penetrated his body.</p>
<p>“SquireWater Gene +1; Rank Unchanged.”</p>
<p>Spirits seemed fanatical before a king spirit, and when they
moved on from that island, Flame Giant did not rest his trumpeting
of Han Sen’s coming. Far across that strange realm, spirits gladly
offered up their geno points.</p>
<p>“I wonder how they’d feel if they knew I was a human?” Han Sen
wondered to himself.</p>
<p>But over the course of that day, Han Sen’s spirit geno points
were increasing rapidly. And that meant all of his elemental
proficiencies were improving.</p>
<p>“This is way too awesome!” As Han Sen watched his spirit gene
tally increase one by one, he hoped this could keep going until it
reached the figure of one hundred and he maxed it out
completely.</p>
<p>Obtaining spirit geno points in the sanctuary, by ordinary
means, was incredibly difficult. Right now, Han Sen only had to
stand in place and wait for spirits to practically deliver them to
him on a platter.</p>
<p>He stayed there for a long time, but he began to feel tired
after a while, so he returned to the spirit hall. His super spirit
mode deactivated and his body entered a state of pain.</p>
<p>In the spirit base, he could keep his super spirit mode activate
for the entire duration he was there, but back in the sanctuaries,
he could still only use it for three seconds.</p>
<p>When his super king spirit mode ended, his spirit stone
disappeared, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a look at his geno points, and he could not stop
smiling.</p>
<p>Han Sen tested whether or not he had to be in super king spirit
mode to create a spirit stone in the spirit hall again, and it
worked.</p>
<p>When outside the spirit hall, no such thing occurred. When his
super king spirit mode ran out in the hall, his spirit stone would
go with it.</p>
<p>With the spirit base, though, Han Sen’s workload in the Third
God’s Sanctuary was significantly lessened. Once he rested up, he
planned to go back to the spirit hall, transform, and return to the
spirit base and continue earning geno points. And after settling on
this regime, Flame Giant’s deduction was correct; Han Sen’s name
did indeed become heard of, far and wide.</p>
<p>Everyone in the first spirit base soon heard about the existence
of a king spirit called The King, and it wasn’t long before it was
whispered between the spirits out in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>But when many king spirits heard of this person, all they could
do was frown.</p>
<p>A natural king spirit was given a title by God, and for one to
be simply called The King, it didn’t sound legitimate. It was most
certainly not a name in the same vein as they were traditionally
given, and if it wasn’t a name given by God, there was only one
possibility.</p>
<p>Two king spirits must have produced an offspring. If The King
was born from the copulation of two king spirits, then it was only
natural the baby would not have a name given by God.</p>
<p>Many king spirits believed The King was a king spirit that had
been born.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been born, then he wouldn’t have entered the first
spirit base. A natural king spirit always had an extremely high
level, and they would never have to go through the first spirit
base.</p>
<p>All the king spirits then wondered who that person might have
been. Whoever it was, they believed him to be cocky, and they most
assuredly wanted to teach the spirit a lesson or two in how to
behave.</p>
<p>But most of the king spirits had opened many of their gene
locks, and as a result, they could not backtrack through their
levels of ascension and challenge The King.</p>
<p>That being said, there were other king spirits still in the
first spirit base, and they too were made angry upon hearing the
name of The King. Driven mad, they all vowed to kick his bacon.</p>
<p>Han Sen was oblivious to these rumblings though, and so he just
relished his time in the limelight, reveling in the love and
adoration he was being shown. When he returned, the spirits
continued to allow themselves to be defeated.</p>
<p>Flame Giant followed Han Sen around like a shadow, and soon, his
presence grew on him. Han Sen felt as if he had a humble servant at
his disposal, and so he felt like royalty.</p>
<p>“These spirits are so simple-minded,” Han Sen sighed in his
heart.</p>
<p>As he searched for a new target, someone drove an island towards
him at an alarming speed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen this happen many times already, and it was
usually a case of another spirit, dying to offer themselves up.
Expecting this, he decided to recline against his statue and wait
for the person to get there.</p>
<p>As it neared, Flame Giant did what he always did. He shouted
aloud, “Hail to The King! The King has come; submit an offering
of…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his speech, Flame Giant froze and fell to
the ground, saying, “Greetings, Thunderdevil King.”</p>
<p>The statue that belonged to this spirit was about a hundred
meters high, and its owner exuded a horrifying feeling. As he
looked at Han Sen, a purple light flashed and flickered in his
eyes.</p>
<p>All the spirits around Han Sen knelt before him.</p>
<p>Immediately, Han Sen knew he’d encountered someone he could
consider a big cheese. When he looked at the statue’s number, he
noticed it was a simple seven. Very few were stronger than him.</p>
