<p>“This is…” Old Huang and everyone there looked at the
Dragon-Blood Snake in wonder. They thought it was some small,
average pet beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen let the pet do the explaining for him, by having it
unleash its gene locks.</p>
<p>When the first gene lock opened, the Dragon-Blood Snake’s body
grew to the size of a tiger.</p>
<p>When the second gene lock opened, the Dragon-Blood Snake’s body
grew to the size of a bull.</p>
<p>When the third gene lock opened, the Dragon-Blood Snake’s body
grew to the size of a golem.</p>
<p>When the fourth gene lock opened, the Dragon-Blood Snake’s body
grew to the size of a giant beast.</p>
<p>When the fifth gene lock opened, the Dragon-Blood Snake’s body
grew to the size of a dinosaur.</p>
<p>“A pet beast soul with five of its gene locks opened?!” The
plaza gathering had quickly become an audience, and they were each
amazed by the mutant pet.</p>
<p>Then, the Dragon-Blood Snake hissed and grew in size one more
time. Its red-scales glistened as it became a terrifying beast of
gigantic proportions. It looked ready to murder any that offended
it.</p>
<p>“Six gene locks? The best possible mutant pet one can claim?!”
Someone in the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>“Old Huang, with this snake… Do you think we stand a chance of
repelling those who seek to remove you from your home?” Han Sen
posed the question.</p>
<p>“That just may be possible.” Although he tried to hide it, his
loosely bottled excitement began to overflow.</p>
<p>Although the spirit shelter that opposed them had many
creatures, it was very unlikely there’d be a creature amongst them
with an open gene lock tally anywhere close to the snake’s.</p>
<p>Mutant creatures could open six gene locks at the most, but that
did not mean it was achievable for all mutant creatures.</p>
<p>And now, it wasn’t only Old Huang who got excited, as hope of a
future in their shelter returned to the crowd.</p>
<p>“This mutant creature can at least kite three creatures for us,
and with us there, valiantly fighting alongside it, we may just
pull through!”</p>
<p>“Yes; let’s fight and prove to that spirit we’re not to be
messed with.”</p>
<p>“We’re not leaving this place; f*ck those spirits!”</p>
<p>Aside from a few of the elders, everyone who saw the snake had a
change of heart they were keen to vocally express.</p>
<p>Old Huang told everyone to calm down soon after, however, and
then told Han Sen, “I would like to ask you a few questions, Han
Sen. And I would like you to answer my questions seriously and
truthfully. This is a matter of life and death.”</p>
<p>“I will gladly answer your questions,” Han Sen said in
response.</p>
<p>“Where did you come here from? Did you travel here from another
shelter?” Old Huang asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Old Huang also nodded. Then he asked, “If we
succeed, will you remain with us?”</p>
<p>Everyone understood what Old Huang was implying.</p>
<p>Even if they could withstand the attack, Han Sen’s absence after
that would mean they’d have no more manpower if something sought to
retaliate. They would still be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Fighting now would be pointless if it meant they’d only fall in
the future.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Han Sen, hoping he would choose to stay.</p>
<p>“I will leave,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>Everyone looked disappointed. It felt as if their new-found hope
had been dashed across the rocks.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your honesty.” Old Huang did not hold it against
Han Sen and understood why he’d leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a famous person of much renown. He had a
Dragon-Blood Snake with six of its gene locks open. He was destined
for a place greater than the little shelter he had stumbled upon.
He was bound for someplace far grander, for sure.</p>
<p>“I have not finished. I said I will leave, but only under these
two conditions; firstly, we claim that royal shelter. Secondly, if
we fail, I leave the snake behind,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Everyone looked surprised, and in response, Old Huang asked, “Do
you speak the truth?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe it, I can give you the snake now.” Han Sen
was not afraid of any potential theft, and didn’t think they’d
refuse to return it. Had they sought to, there was nowhere they
could run off to. They were in the middle of the woods with a small
army of creatures preparing to wipe them off the face of the
sanctuary. To do so would be futile.</p>
<p>If the people did not stand and fight for their shelter, they’d
most likely run off into the forest. And gauging the strength they
possessed, Han Sen believed they did not have the mettle to survive
in that domain.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the end result if they chose to flee, so he felt
compelled to help them.</p>
<p>Han Sen would use this opportunity to raise his mutant geno
point tally, too. It was far more difficult to do when flying solo,
after all.</p>
<p>The people there weren’t that strong, but many could challenge
and rival mutant creatures in strength.</p>
<p>If Han Sen could use this opportunity to obtain a royal shelter,
it would be a terrific result, as well.</p>
<p>“Little Han, you are the president’s son-in-law, so of course we
believe you.” Old Huang was not stupid, and he most certainly would
not have kept the snake.</p>
<p>Now, following Han Sen’s promise, everyone readied themselves
for a fight and geared up in the best armaments they possessed.</p>
<p>“So, which shelter seeks to destroy you? And what is its
master?” Han Sen hadn’t been told the name of the shelter that
sought to conquer them, so he asked for elucidation.</p>
<p>“It’s Thorn Shelter, and its master is Thorn Baron. She is a
royal spirit, and she is wickedly powerful,” Old Huang said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised to receive this answer, and so he said,
“Ah, then we are in the regions that belong to Thorn Shelter?”</p>
<p>Han Sen became the de facto leader of the shelter for the time
being, and others relied upon him to establish and organize their
defenses and tactics for the coming battle. He was capable, when it
came to leading others; he might not have had what it took to
command large armies, but a group of about thirty people was within
his comfort zone.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to use his formations to effectively coordinate
the others.</p>
<p>At first, others did not trust Han Sen, but after some more
practice with the formations, they listened and paid greater heed.
They soon realized the true talent he had, and so they were all
able to work together in greater cohesion and synergy.</p>
<p>Three days later, the spirit army had yet to arrive. Han Sen
traveled to a nearby knoll, to see if he could spy any
movement.</p>
