<p>Qu Lanxi and Chu Ming were engaged in merry conversation as they
walked, but that soon came to an end when they entered the field
and caught sight of their Ink-Sword Tree.</p>
<p>They had spent the last three years cultivating it, and in a few
more days, they’d have been able to harvest the thirty-four
ordinary gene weapons. But now, the tree had suddenly died.</p>
<p>It had once borne an abundance of emerald leaves, but now only a
few yellow leaves remained stubbornly clinging to its withered
branches. The ink swords that once inhabited the tree had all
disappeared, too. Mounds of dead leaves and rusted blades were all
that remained, scattered about.</p>
<p>“How did that happen?!” Chu Ming ran in front of the Ink-Sword
Tree, digging through the leaves like mad. He grabbed one of the
rusted swords that had broken in half, following its fall.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi’s face was robbed of all its color. The last three
years of her effort had been squandered overnight. She wouldn’t
receive any of the fruits of her labor, so her heart and mood were
swiftly crushed.</p>
<p>“Someone is here! And he looks injured.” Qu Lanxi ran in front
of the tree, looking at Han Sen as she came.</p>
<p>“A person?” Chu Ming was vacant-minded when he asked, unsure of
how to respond to the tree’s death. He looked over to where Qu
Lanxi was pointing, and saw a man lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Chu Ming quickly ran over to him, grabbed him by the collar and
shouted with great anger, “Did you destroy our Ink-Sword
Tree?!”</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>When Han Sen was grabbed and shaken by the angry shouting man,
his organs were injured. He tried to speak, but could only spill
blood from his mouth.</p>
<p>“Did you do it? Answer me! Did you ruin our tree?!” Chu Ming
continued to shout, shaking Han Sen. The tree’s death had really
thrown him for a loop.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? Don’t you see how injured he is? What, do you
want to kill him?!” Qu Lanxi pulled Chu Ming away from Han Sen, and
then knelt down to inspect him.</p>
<p>“Lanxi, this man has just randomly appeared in our garden on the
same day our tree happens to be ruined. Put two and two together,
would you? He is obviously responsible for this!” Chu Ming was
consumed with madness.</p>
<p>“Chill out. Ask him politely first. He’s human; a friend, at
that. I don’t think he’d try to harm us on purpose.” Qu Lanxi said
as she checked out Han Sen.</p>
<p>“But…” Chu Ming tried to say something, but fell short.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi shook her head and said, “Ask him later. Right now, he
is far too injured. Let’s help him recover first; you can ask all
the questions you desire later.”</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi then summoned a turtle and told Chu Ming to help lift
Han Sen and place him on the turtle’s back. After that, they would
depart the garden.</p>
<p>Chu Ming was struggling to accept the death of the tree, and he
was fuming mad at the likely culprit. Still, he was willing to
oblige her request, and he lifted Han Sen onto the turtle. Then,
they returned to a wooden cabin that was not too far from the
tree.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi brought over some medicine and applied it to Han Sen’s
body. The medicine was intended for fixing simple things.</p>
<p>“He’s too injured. We need a doctor.” Qu Lanxi frowned.</p>
<p>“Doctor? This yahoo might have killed our Ink-Sword Tree! Who
cares if he’s injured? Why should we fix him on our penny? We spent
everything we had on that tree, and toiled to nurture it for three
years, with the dream that we’d live a better life once its fruit
matured. But now? It’s all gone. Where am I supposed to get that
money now, huh?” Chu Ming was furious.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi understood where he was coming from, but she was
conflicted with the desire to help the injured man. She didn’t know
how to respond.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your concern, but I’ll be fine in a few days.”
After the rest, Han Sen was feeling a little bit better, and his
voice had now returned to him.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you can talk now? That’s great news. Hey, tell me
something here; did you destroy my tree? And if you did, why?” Chu
Ming was keen to begin his interrogation.</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt him.” Qu Lanxi stopped Chu Ming, and then looked at
Han Sen and asked, “Who are you, injured one? And why were you in
our garden?”</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed and said, “My name is San Mu. I was attacked by a
creature and ran this way. I saw the tree fall victim to that
putrid beast, and I believe that is what caused it to die. It is my
fault, though; do not worry, I will accept full responsibility and
be sure to pay you back in full.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, you have wealth? And you’re willing to pay us back? Well,
alright then. One ink sword’s price is equal to that of a portion
of ordinary creature flesh. We had thirty-four swords in total, so
give me the flesh of thirty-four ordinary creatures. Do that, and
I’ll let you off the hook so you can sod off back to where you came
from,” Chu Ming said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, a San always pays his debts. As soon as I’m back
on my feet, I’ll get to work on paying you back.” After a brief
pause, Han Sen continued to say, “Is there a shelter nearby, in
which I could teleport back to the Alliance?”</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra could fix him, but it was too slow. If he
could return to the Alliance, he could heal at a much quicker
rate.</p>
<p>When Chu Ming heard Han Sen was willing to pay him back, his
mood had considerably brightened. He said, “You are joking? Haha!
What a joker. The spirit won’t let us go back.”</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi looked at Han Sen and asked, “San Mu, which shelter do
you come from? And which creature did you encounter?”</p>
<p>“Pah! Where else could he have come from, girl? He most likely
came from the Thorn Forest; what other place has sordid creatures
in these parts, eh?” Chu Ming interjected.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed in relief. He believed Chu Ming to be the biggest
idiot he had met in a long time. With that information, making a
story wouldn’t be so hard.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are right. But I haven’t been in the Third God’s
Sanctuary long. I am unfamiliar with this area.” Han Sen suddenly
coughed up some blood.</p>
<p>“Oy! Don’t die yet. You owe us money, remember?” Chu Ming was a
little repulsed.</p>
<p>Chu Ming then thought something had to be amiss. He stared at
Han Sen and said, “Wait, if you only just entered the Third God’s
Forest, where are you going to find us ordinary flesh?”</p>
<p>“Well, can I pay you back in the Alliance?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“We can’t leave this place, so what would be the point?” Chu
Ming suddenly felt the clouds of doom return to fog the clarity of
his mind and said, “Oh, no. No. Nooo! This guy can’t pay us. He
can’t pay us!”</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi sighed and then said, “Well, let’s just focus on fixing
him first.”</p>
<p>“No, you *sshole! Give me my tree back!” Chu Ming’s mind
returned to the three years he spent carefully tending to the tree.
He looked like a broken man.</p>
<p>Qu Lanxi stopped him and said, “What would be the point in
killing him? When he has healed, perhaps he can pay us back some
other way.”</p>
<p>“Geez, calm down, you two. I will pay you back.” Han Sen
couldn’t blame them for their reactions, and he could tell they
must have endured a difficult life where they were.</p>
<p>Having a three-year dream taken away from you was something no
one could take very well, so Han Sen could understand their
anger.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was confident he could get better, and once his
health returned, paying them back would not be too difficult. All
he was unsure about was how to adequately return the favor they did
by saving his life, despite the trouble he had caused them.</p>
