<p>When Han Sen returned to the oceanside, Queen was using her
sword to skewer and cook fish meat. Although the fire was only
fuelled by vines and sticks, it seemed decent enough to last.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a few other swords propped up beside the fire as
well, each packed with meat. The slices of fish were gold, and the
oil sizzled on them in a tantalizingly. Han Sen had to ask, “Is
this for me?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, are they for you? I am planning to eat them
once they are all done,” Queen responded.</p>
<p>“Can I have some?” Han Sen asked politely.</p>
<p>“If you want; suit yourself.” Queen did not look at Han Sen
once, and continued to stare at the meat in her hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. He picked up some meat and took a bite.
Unfortunately, he should have waited, for his mouth burnt with the
heat. Still, this fresh fish tasted divine compared to the raw fish
they had been eating previously.</p>
<p>“Where is your fox?” Queen watched Han Sen eat like a madman
and, feeling more relaxed, posed the question.</p>
<p>“I took it back.” Han Sen blinked as he told her.</p>
<p>“Really?” Queen looked at Han Sen, not believing him. “Summon
him so we can all eat together.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. It is just a pet; ignore the creature.” Han
Sen thought Queen had learnt something else about the silver fox
when it healed her, but he wasn’t willing to admit it.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Queen didn’t enquire any further and simply continued
cooking her meat.</p>
<p>Han Sen ate eight slices of meat. With a bloated belly, he fell
backwards into the sand. After a large exhale of content, he called
out, “Awesome!”</p>
<p>Queen ate a few, too. But when she was done, she returned her
beast soul sword and started walking off towards the hills.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Han Sen sat up and asked, worrying over
whether or not Queen would find out about the silver fox and
lotus.</p>
<p>“I’m just going for a walk,” Queen replied, already walking off
to the hills.</p>
<p>“I’ll come with you!” Han Sen jumped up with a fright and
thought to himself, “I really can’t hide the silver fox’s reason
for not coming back.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be difficult for Queen to discover where the lotus
and the silver fox were. After ascending a small hill, she caught
sight of them both from afar. She turned around and looked at Han
Sen. With a cocky smile, she turned back and began walking towards
the fox.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Queen pointed towards the lotus as she neared
the silver fox.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but the silver fox refused to leave after finding
it,” Han Sen explained. Queen took a closer look at the lotus and
began to rest near it without responding.</p>
<p>The next day, Queen asked Han Sen, “Are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“If the silver fox isn’t leaving, then neither am I. Do you want
to leave first?” Han Sen asked, blinking.</p>
<p>“If we meet again, we will split it in half.” Queen looked at
Han Sen, but it didn’t look like she wanted to leave.</p>
<p>“What half? It is a pet. You want to fight for food with a pet?”
Han Sen’s heart was saying no and he was only pretending.</p>
<p>“If he eats it, I don’t want it anymore. If you take it, I will
accept half,” Queen said.</p>
<p>“Why would I want it? This is for the silver fox. I am not a
pet; I don’t need it,” Han Sen told her, sharply. He was starting
to feel a little annoyed.</p>
<p>Queen didn’t say much, and she remained near the silver fox,
guarding the lotus.</p>
<p>“The silver fox was guarding it, which made me think I had a
chance. But now there are two people guarding it.” Han Sen thought
to himself. He was also starting to believe that the silver fox was
a girl. Otherwise, why would it be behaving like Queen was? That
was the only explanation for how selfish it was being.</p>
<p>Han Sen never thought about the possibility that he was more
selfish than the silver fox and Queen combined.</p>
<p>They stayed on the island for four days. The snow-white flowers
started to wilt, but they did so slowly. Only two petals fell off a
day. SInce there were so many, heaven only knew how long it would
take for the entire thing to wilt.</p>
<p>The lotus seeds on the inside were growing bigger, as well. They
looked like blood crystals, and they continued to grow fuller. They
emitted a pleasant fragrance, and smelling it brought comfort and
relaxation to their minds.</p>
<p>“That must be some good stuff, but how can I take all the seeds
without Queen and the silver fox noticing?” Han Sen watched the
lotus intently each day, all the while fostering a plan to take it
from the others.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not sure if he could beat them both; otherwise, he’d
just grab it.</p>
<p>Half a month later, the petals had all come off. The lotus
itself was now like a plate. The blood crystal seeds were so round
and full, they looked like rubies the size of a pigeon’s egg.</p>
<p>Han Sen had yet to come up with an idea that would allow him to
claim ownership of the seeds, but all of a sudden, he heard the
shriek of a bird. He saw a green and blueish-colored bird that
didn’t look too far removed from a peacock. With no idea where it
had come from, Han Sen saw it fly madly around the sky, cawing as
loudly as it could. It also seemed to be afraid of the three of
them, which stayed its desire to come down.</p>
<p>The silver fox now looked nervous. It stood up and looked at the
peacock in the sky as if it were an enemy.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Queen were shocked. They understood that it was most
likely a super creature, seeing as it paid little heed to the
silver fox’s presence. This made their faces bleak.</p>
<p>The peacock continued to circle them in the sky, refusing to
leave. But neither did it want to come down. It seemed as if it was
waiting for the seeds to ripen, just like they were.</p>
<p>“Where did that bird come from? Why would it be out here at
sea?” Han Sen thought only the silver fox and Queen were competing
with him for the seeds. If things had remained that way, at least
he had a fair chance of obtaining a few of them.</p>
<p>But now with a super creature in the vicinity, who knew what
might happen?</p>
<p>Perhaps even the combination of Han Sen and the silver fox
wouldn’t be enough to fight the super creature.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was feeling depressed amidst these thoughts,
suddenly heard a sound at the seashore. Looking out to the ocean,
he watched the waters boil. A lobster with a purple shell that was
a dozen meters long emerged. It remained afloat for a brief while,
summoning up tall waves.</p>
<p>It then moved on to circle the island, without getting too
close.</p>
<p>“Crap! Another one. How many creatures want these seeds?”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt frustrated. He didn’t know when and where another
super creature might arise, but fortunately, no more decided to
make an appearance. Aside from the peacock and lobster, there was
no sign of another one coming to vie for their seeds.</p>
<p>With one of them taking the sea and one of them taking the sky,
it would be impossible for him to escape now.</p>
<p>“Let’s fall back. If we get surrounded, there is nothing we can
do to fight them,” Queen calmly said.</p>
<p>“Silver fox, come!” Han Sen shouted at the silver fox, with a
tone of gravity. He was afraid if the silver fox stayed here to
guard, he would quickly be overwhelmed by the two super creatures.
Even though it was a super creature itself, its strength had
limits.</p>
