<p>When Han Sen returned, he asked around. The general consensus
was that no one really knew what Dong Lin was doing by allowing his
participation.</p>
<p>“Is Dong Lin really going to be this nice?” Han Sen struggled to
believe they would.</p>
<p>“No matter which way you look at it, and provided it isn’t a
trap, then they are being nice. Otherwise, they simply wouldn’t let
you participate in the pet fights,” Ji Yanran said.</p>
<p>“Do you think there is an ulterior motive to this kindness of
theirs? Is it a conspiracy?” Han Sen looked at Ji Yanran with
concern.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but the match has been arranged to take place in
the central galaxy. It won’t be hosted in Dong Lin itself, so there
is nothing the Qi family can do.” Ji Yanran wasn’t really sure what
to make of it, either.</p>
<p>If there was a conspiracy, there was no way they would dare do
something aggressive towards Han Sen in the Alliance. That was,
unless they had lost their minds and gone completely insane.</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t care about the fact that he was the
president’s son-in-law, getting the Luo family mad would lead to
the Dong Lin company being destroyed in a single day.</p>
<p>“Are you going to go?” Ji Yanran looked at Han Sen and
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Why would I turn down some free goodies? If the
matches really are taking place in the central galaxy instead of
Dong Lin, then there is nothing to be afraid of.” Han Sen
laughed.</p>
<p>“Well, be careful. That man in Dong Ling is not soft,” Ji Yanran
reminded him.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Han Sen nodded, but his mind was already adrift. He was
pondering how he might split up the prize medicine he’d win. He
needed some more Geno Creation Pills, as the silver fox had eaten
them all. Therefore, it was about time he restocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen booked a holiday to the central galaxy and went to visit
his mother and father-in-law. He had dinner with Ji Ruozhen, and
after they finished, they had a discussion about the pet
matches.</p>
<p>Ji Ruozhen guessed Dong Lin meant no harm and were being
sincere, hence why they were hosting the event elsewhere. It was a
place they did not have exclusive control of.</p>
<p>“Maybe the Qi family would like a favor off you,” Ji Ruozhen
said. Then, he continued, “But that is only a guess. Regardless of
how things may seem, exercise caution and be careful when you go
there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gestured in agreement, and Ji Ruozhen continued his
dialogue. “The match starts tomorrow. This will be your first time
in the central galaxy, yes? Ji Qing will be there, so allow her to
be your tour guide.”</p>
<p>“Wait, the Ji Qing who slew a super creature?” Han Sen was
surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, and she wants to see you. She has wanted to for a while,
but she has been unable to see you due to your commitments to the
army. Now seems a fitting time.” Ji Ruozhen paused for a brief
moment, then went on to say, “But this girl is really quite
arrogant. If she offends you in any way, don’t take it to
heart.”</p>
<p>Han Sen confirmed his understanding. Even if she was arrogant
and offensive, Han Sen wouldn’t bother picking a fight with a
little girl.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen saw Ji Qing, he was wrong. She was not a young
person, as he suspected. She looked more mature than Ji Yanran, and
she was beautiful and charming.</p>
<p>“Little Qing, treat Han Sen well. This is his first time in the
central galaxy, so make sure to hit the hotspots and show him
around.” Ji Ruozhen smiled warmly at Ji Qing as he bid the
request.</p>
<p>“Do not worry, Uncle. I will treat him well.” Ji Qing smiled
back.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, let’s go.” Ji Qing walked in front of Han Sen
and smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her out and was led to an aircraft. She hopped
into the pilot’s seat and asked him to step in.</p>
<p>“Little Qing, are you driving this?” Han Sen thought a renowned
member of the family such as her would have bodyguards by her side,
or at least a chauffeur for a pilot.</p>
<p>“Who else?” Ji Qing asked Han Sen as she started up the
engine.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d have a bodyguard or something,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“This is the central galaxy, and there are robotic spies
everywhere you look. They have guns that can nail targets a great
distance away, with an accuracy metric of millimeters. If anyone
posed a threat, they’d hit the ground dead within ten seconds.” Ji
Qing smiled and launched the aircraft.</p>
<p>“Is there anywhere specific you’d like to go?” Ji Qing asked Han
Sen, as she flew the craft.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time here, so I don’t know what’s on the menu.
Why don’t you decide on where we should go? And once we’re done,
take me back,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I can’t do that. Uncle told me to treat you well, so how about
I take you someplace fun?” Ji Qing had an enigmatic smile as she
turned the aircraft in another direction and accelerated.</p>
<p>When he saw her smile, Han Sen knew it wouldn’t be long before
he found himself in trouble that night. She was obviously cooking
up a devious scheme.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not mind too much, and so he placed his gaze on
what he could see out the windows. The starscapes in the central
galaxy were different, and incredibly beautiful. This was his first
time seeing such vistas, and so the sights were particularly
special to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed at things he did not know about and asked about
them. Ji Qing answered everything but felt a little
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ji Qing thought herself to be the first person to slay a super
creature and obtain a Life Geno Essence, and she believed Han Sen
to be the second. But now, whenever people discussed super
creatures and Life Geno Essences, they thought about Han Sen. It
seemed as if everyone had forgotten she was the first, which made
her a little upset.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she had heard many people in her own family gush
praise and compliments towards Han Sen. It made her a little
envious, hence her eagerness to meet the thunder-thief. She wished
to see how smart he was.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was as smart as everyone was saying, she would have
felt better about things. But right now, Han Sen was behaving like
a curious child. He didn’t look half as powerful as people were
saying. She felt it was unfair to have her reputation and limelight
stolen by a guy such as him.</p>
<p>Of course, she knew she couldn’t judge someone through this
alone. Therefore, she had prepared something to gauge Han Sen’s
true power.</p>
<p>She wasn’t going to fight Han Sen herself, as she wasn’t even an
evolver yet. She knew Han Sen had recently beat Yu Qielan, but she
believed she was only a few levels below Han Sen. If she became an
evolver, she believed she’d be stronger than him. For him to beat
Yu Qielan was nothing.</p>
<p>But right now, Ji Qing had prepared something a lot more fun for
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Thinking of that, she couldn’t keep the weird smile from
creeping across her face. Her eyes squinted queerly.</p>
<p>Soon after, the aircraft landed atop a large skyscraper.</p>
