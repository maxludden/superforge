<h2>Beat Me and You Can Fight Dollar</h2>
<h3>Chapter 825</h3>

<p>The four of them returned to the plaza in a glum mood. Although
they did not really know Huang Xiao, they felt awful upon learning
what had happened to him.</p>
<p>“Please, fulfill your obligation and bring me Dollar. He is your
strongest young one, after all.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, upon his return, heard Yu Qielan speaking to the
receptionist.</p>
<p>“Fuck! If I was a surpasser, I’d kick his ass so hard!” Tang
Zhenliu said, angrily. He wished he was a surpasser, for in his
present state, he could hardly lay a finger on Yu Qielan.</p>
<p>With Shura Change and Blood Injection, Yu Qielan was already
able to beat a surpasser that was a celestial being. The hidden
power he possessed was something not even Huang Xiao had the
ability to overcome.</p>
<p>Lin Feng was calm and did not say anything more. The people who
knew him well, however, could tell he was suppressing a great fire
of anger inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly stood up and walked towards the stage. He was
fuming mad, and although he did not know Huang Xiao, he despised Yu
Qielan enough to know what he had to do. Furthermore, he had
repeatedly asked for a fight against Dollar.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed in his heart and thought to himself, “You want
to fight Dollar, do you? As you wish. Prepare to get spent.”</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what are you doing?!” Seeing Han Sen approach the
stage, Ji Yanran became incredibly worried.</p>
<p>“Old Han, do not be reckless! We can kill him together, once we
become surpassers!” Tang Zhenliu called out.</p>
<p>“It’s only a royal shura. There’s no need for me to wait that
long,” Han Sen said in response, as his fingers glided across Ji
Yanran’s face. He then told her, “Sit right there and wait for me
to kill this asshole.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen continued his approach to the stage.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu still wanted to prevent him from doing this, and Ji
Yanran’s worry was not alleviated.</p>
<p>“If he wants to go that much, he must be confident,” Lin Feng
calmly said, stopping the two from any further attempts to change
Han Sen’s mind.</p>
<p>As Han Sen neared the stage, Yu Qielan was still requesting that
someone find Dollar so that they might fight.</p>
<p>“Yu Qielan, right? Do you have to fight Dollar to feel good
about yourself?” Han Sen said, as he ascended the stage and looked
directly at his soon-to-be enemy.</p>
<p>Everyone’s attention now turned to silently focus on Han Sen,
unsure what he was planning to do.</p>
<p>“Aside from Dollar, what other challenger can I fight who is
worth my time?” Yu Qielan proudly stated.</p>
<p>There were others aside from Huang Xiao that were willing to
fight him, but Yu Qielan declined them all.</p>
<p>“Okay, then. You can fight him. But first, you must beat me,”
Han Sen calmly said.</p>
<p>“You? And who are you exactly, chump? I tire of you humans
attempting to stall my true desire. How long do you expect me to
fight scrawny worthless beings before I can go up against Dollar?”
Yu Qielan looked at Han Sen with disdain.</p>
<p>“I lost to Dollar once. Dollar took me out in one-and-a-half
punches. If you beat me, I can call upon Dollar to come over here
and whip you like a dog. How does that sound?” Han Sen looked at Yu
Qielan.</p>
<p>“One-and-a-half punches, huh? Is this guy for real?” Yu Qielan
ignored Han Sen and spoke to the receptionist directly.</p>
<p>“Of course, he is my fiancé! He only ever speaks the truth.” Ji
Yanran stood up and said.</p>
<p>“President Ji’s daughter? Fine, I’ll believe you once more.” Yu
Qielan looked at Ji Yanran and then returned his gaze to Han Sen.
He continued by saying, “If I win, and I am still unable to see
Dollar, then tonight’s fighting is over. I have no interest in
fighting noobs any longer.”</p>
<p>Han Sen then coldly said, “Humanity is graced with a desire to
uphold their word. Furthermore, we are polite. You allowed Huang
Xiao to strike first in the last match, so allow me to return the
gesture. Yu Qielan, I want you to make the first attack.”</p>
<p>“Good. If you can withstand one-and-a-half Dollar punches, we
can quickly determine whether or not you can withstand
one-point-zero of my punches.” Yu Qielan did not waste any time and
immediately swung his fist.</p>
<p>As he swung, he used Shura Change and the wretched
power-boosting method of Blood Injection. He planned to
one-hit-kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had started this match, so he couldn’t allow himself to
immediately get punched and defeated.</p>
<p>If the demigod stepped in now, it would be humiliating not only
for him, but for humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>Such a tale would be laughed about by the shura for many more
generations. It would be a jest, the story of a proud human that
sought to start a fight but was knocked out by a single punch in a
single second.</p>
<p>The demigod was ambivalent, and wasn’t too sure what to think.
They couldn’t rightly save him, but they did not want him to be
killed. As such, they were unsure about what to do.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is still an evolver. Is he going to be okay?” A
middle-aged man frowned while watching the video.</p>
<p>“Unless he is close to the rank of Celestial Being, even if he
was from the Luo family and had learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra, I
do not believe he can beat the shura. And I say this in the
knowledge that the Falsified-Sky Sutra is an evil and murderous
talent. It is truly wicked, but without the necessary power, it
won’t yield the results he desires. He will die.” The old man
looked glum as he spoke. He hated Yu Qielan’s behavior, and despite
his dire prediction, he wanted Han Sen to win.</p>
<p>But the power gulf was very wide, and for Han Sen to win, it
would require nothing short of a miracle. That was why even this
old man’s predictions were miserable.</p>
<p>On another planet, Luo Haitang watched the fight through a video
stream while Luo Li made tea for him.</p>
<p>Luo Yin had not found Han Sen, but Luo Haitang believed Han Sen
carried the blood and genetic qualities of the Luo family. As such,
he didn’t think Han Sen had what it took to deny the allure of
learning the Falsified-Sky Sutra.</p>
<p>“Show me how far your practice of the Falsified-Sky Sutra has
come along.” Luo Haitang looked at Han Sen through the video stream
intently, earnestly hoping he would retaliate with the deadly
skill.</p>
<p>Ji Yanwu and Ji Ruozhen were watching the scene, as well, and
they looked nervous. Although they had faith in the Falsified-Sky
Sutra, they knew Yu Qielan had Blood Injection, and they believed
the shura was devastatingly more powerful.</p>
<p>The Ning family, the Qin family, the Wang family, the Dong Lin
and Zhao families were all watching the same match. They wanted to
see what path Han Sen had decided to follow. They wondered if he’d
be more like Luo Haitang, doing so in a bid to impress
everyone.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran and her friends were extremely anxious. They knew Han
Sen was strong, but they were still worried. The power Yu Qielan
possessed exceeded the possible power of an evolver by a great
extent.</p>
<p>As everyone watched with bated breath, Han Sen did not choose to
dodge the punch. Instead, he swung a fist of his own.</p>
<p>Han Sen aimed for Yu Qielan’s head, electing to risk his life to
deliver damage just as Huang Xiao had.</p>
