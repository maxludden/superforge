<h2>I’ll Buy It</h2>
<h3>Chapter 653</h3>

<p>It was a black T-rex beast soul. Its name was “Rex Spike.” It
was a heavy metal weapon that was about two meters long.</p>
<p>From the booklet provided, the weapon looked like a giant
umbrella that was folded. The end was sharp and it had a hilt at
the bottom.</p>
<p>It was a violent and visceral heavy metal weapon. It was two
meters long and the handle was fifty centimeters long. The front
was sharp and serrated, and from afar, one would guess it was a
strange greatsword or medieval lance, but not quite. It was weird,
yes, but it looked like a cruel and merciless weapon.</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Han Sen wanted to purchase that
weapon. He liked it a lot, due to it being both heavy and long.
Going up against a super creature with something like this, with a
bit more range, was far better than using a puny dagger.</p>
<p>It was a black T-rex beast soul, but he could not tell if it was
associated with the element of fire. To Han Sen, though, what he
saw was enough to prompt him to buy it at once.</p>
<p>The beast soul was cheaper than the other sacred-blood beast
souls available, too. That was primarily due to the fact that this
weapon type wasn’t all that popular. He could use it as a lance,
but the handle was too short. That was okay, though, because most
lance skills could not be cast with Rex Spike, anyway.</p>
<p>He could use it like a sword, but the blade did not look like a
traditional one, which would prevent him from casting sword skills
with it. Additionally, the weapon was so heavy, ordinary evolvers
would not even be able to lift it. Due to these issues, the price
had been reduced and Han Sen was more than happy to buy it at the
price listed, without needing to haggle.</p>
<p>After all, it was rare to see T-rex beast souls of a weapon
type. It was a heavy weapon, too, which was something that would be
useful for Han Sen.</p>
<p>If he’d had a super Rex Spike when he went to hunt the
Fire-Scale T-rex, he wouldn’t have had as much trouble as he
did.</p>
<p>After buying the Rex Spike, Han Sen no longer had any need to
peruse the markets. He left and went to find a place he could stay.
When he was in his room, he observed the Rex Spike and gem beast
soul intently.</p>
<p>“They are both rex-type. Aside from the fact that the Rex Spike
has no wings, the similarities in design and appearance are
striking. Although it may not have a fire-element, the success rate
should still be high. Right?” Han Sen gritted his teeth while he
mulled over the question. He did not want to overthink things, so
he immediately attempted to combine the gem beast soul with the Rex
Spike.</p>
<p>“God, Buddha, Goddess, Mary, Jesus, and Mohammad, bless me with
your divinity! I only have this one super gem beast soul.
Throughout the entirety of my life, this is the only one I have
ever managed to get. So, please, help me!” Han Sen’s heart prayed
intently to every god and religious deity he could think of.</p>
<p>Inside the gem, he watched the image of the mini Fire-Scale
T-rex be attracted and absorbed into an image of a black T-rex.
Then, the black T-rex roared to the sky as its body underwent a
transformation of some kind.</p>
<p>The black scales of the beast became dark red. The body began to
smoke and the talons increased in sharpness and thickness. Its head
also grew in size. Overall, the T-rex looked to be considerably
stronger.</p>
<p>“Roar!”</p>
<p>The T-rex let out a horrible roar as a geyser of flame shot out
of its mouth. Then, it took off in flight.</p>
<p>It was just a virtual image, coming from the Sea of Soul. It did
not spit out real fire, because if it did, the entire house would
have been little more than smoldering cinders by that point.</p>
<p>“Rex Spike has successfully combined with Fire-Scale T-rex
Gemstone. The evolution has provided you a Flaming Rex Spike super
beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen almost jumped up in happiness. He quickly summoned the
Flaming Rex Spike and immediately saw that it had increased in
length. It was now certainly longer than two meters. It was colored
a dark red and encircled in an aura of flame. The weapon now looked
even more wretched and cruel, like some violent beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung it twice. He randomly hit something, which spawned
a beautiful array of sparks.</p>
<p>Han Sen really liked it. It was a super heavy weapon and its
presence was intimidating. In the future, he would have no problem
tearing the bodies of smaller monsters apart.</p>
<p>“If I shoved this big guy up the asshole of a super creature,
they’d feel awesome.”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen fed a black crystal to the Flaming
Rex Spike. He wanted to make it as strong as possible and try to
push it up to a berserk super beast soul. If he did that, it would
be even easier for him to kill a super creature.</p>
<p>After the flaming rex swallowed the black crystal, a strange
spirit exited its body and encompassed it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never evolved a super beast soul before, so he was
not sure how long this process would take.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not evolve the Deadeye Peacock yet because he had
been using it often and he was not sure how long the evolution
process would take. Therefore, he did not feed it a black
crystal.</p>
<p>Now he was willing to let the Flaming Rex Spike evolve first,
since he still had the peacock crossbow.</p>
<p>Han Sen also wanted to find a hyper geno art that was suitable
for his future use of the Flaming Rex Spike, while it continued to
evolve.</p>
<p>The weapon could not be used as a sword or a lance; therefore,
it was difficult to find a hyper geno art that suited it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was overjoyed at the successful combination. He decided
to walk around with Zero for a while longer, buying her some new
clothes and snacks as they went.</p>
<p>The silver fox was lying on Han Sen’s shoulder while Zero
cuddled the pet Meowth. The contrast of black and white pets
side-by-side was a charming sight.</p>
<p>“Those pets are so beautiful. Honey, look!” A woman with big
boobs pointed at Han Sen in delightful surprise.</p>
<p>“I will buy it.” The man near her was really calm, and when he
softly spoke the sentence, the woman became ecstatic.</p>
<p>“Oh, honey! You are so good.” The woman clutched the man’s arms
and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Friend, how much for these pets?” The man walked before Han Sen
with a prideful stride.</p>
<p>“Which one are you buying?” Han Sen asked, blinking.</p>
<p>“I would like them both.” The man looked at the woman near him.
He puffed his chest and spoke with a raised voice, as if to signify
the wealth he possessed.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, pet beast souls weren’t very expensive. The
expensive variants were the high-class pet beast souls that were
able to do combat. He saw that Han Sen’s pets were so small and
cute, and naturally assumed they couldn’t do combat. It was because
of this that he didn’t think they would cost much.</p>
<p>“If you want them both, I’ll give you thirty percent off. At the
low price of seven billion!” Han Sen was in a good mood, so he was
willing to take the time to joke with the pompous fellow.</p>
<p>A big place like the Devil Shelter sold sacred-blood beast souls
for one hundred to two hundred million. If it was just a
sacred-blood pet, it’d be much cheaper, around the dozen million
range.</p>
<p>“Seven billion? You think that’s a super pet or something?” The
man scoffed, and it was obvious he was aware of the existence of
super beast souls.</p>
<p>“You are right,” Han Sen said in his heart. But what his mouth
actually said was, “Although this is not a super pet, it has been
with me for a very long time. I like it a lot. Unless you cough up
the seven billion, I won’t sell.”</p>
<p>The man madly pointed at Han Sen with his finger. He then said
something that shocked Han Sen, “Fine! I’ll buy them for seven
billion.”</p>
