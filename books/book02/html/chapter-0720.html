<h2>Stolen Egg</h2>
<h3>Chapter 720</h3>

<p>Although the super creature was on the precipice of death, it
had managed to lash out enough to deal damage to numerous members
of the Zhao family. But now, the damage it had incurred was too
great, and it would soon fall for the last time.</p>
<p>Zhao Heng was incredibly excited. He commanded his people to
attack the super creature by saying, “Come on! It’s going to die
soon!”</p>
<p>Out of the eight family members, three had been killed. The rest
had incurred at least one trauma or injury, but the thought of
felling a super creature rallied their courage to continue their
fight.</p>
<p>“Let me kill it!” Zhao Haiyang peered at the monster that could
hardly stand and spoke aloud with great excitement.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Zhao Heng wouldn’t disagree. Out of the eight who had
come, Zhao Heng was the eldest, and Zhao Haiyang was a direct
descendant of his.</p>
<p>But before Zhao Haiyang delivered his attack, the super creature
that looked grievously injured was rejuvenated. It pounced on
another family member and took off running into the forest.</p>
<p>Zhao Heng and Zhao Haiyang looked shocked. They did not expect
the super creature to run away, now of all times.</p>
<p>Earlier, the super creature—despite being at an obvious
disadvantage—did not run. Now, it was dying and could barely stand.
Where had the vigor come from?</p>
<p>“Go, chase it! Do not allow it to escape.” Zhao Heng reacted
first, immediately commanding the others to take off after it.</p>
<p>But suddenly, they heard the sound of rock breaking. This was a
surprise to all of them. They turned around to take a look, and the
little hill that was the source of the blood spring exploded
outwards. The spring was no longer a crack in the earth, as a giant
red centipede writhed out amidst a cloud of dust and spewed
rubble.</p>
<p>A dark-red body that was thicker than the carriage of a train
loomed out. A single segment of the centipede was twenty meters
long, and its legs wriggled ceaselessly, carrying it towards the
fighters.</p>
<p>A second later, two of the remaining Zhao family were spiked to
death under the centipede’s wretched legs. The rest of them were
almost frightened to death, and their thought of pursuing the
escaped super creature quickly evaporated. Running away themselves,
they shouted, “Han Sen! Use your pet to restrain it!”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me? You want me to send my pet to its demise,
against a monster such as that?” Han Sen called back, as he and Qin
Xuan had already turned to leave.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do not forget the deal we made,” Zhao Haiyang reminded
him.</p>
<p>“Our deal consisted of me helping you slay the other super
creature; I have done my part. This wasn’t a part of it, so it is
no concern of mine,” Han Sen was far ahead of the others, yelling
back as he ran alongside Qin Xuan.</p>
<p>Zhao Haiyang was furious. The blood centipede was a goliath, and
it terrified them all. This was surely a foe no human could hope to
compete with. A second later, the creature’s mandibles grabbed
another Zhao family member and sloppily devoured him.</p>
<p>There were only three people of the Zhao family left now, but
the blood centipede did not continue to pursue them. Instead, it
took off in the direction the other super creature had gone.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw it, his heart jumped. The super creature had
been attracted away by Wang Yuhang, but now the blood centipede
had, as well. Things were taking a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>“How can Wang Yuhang be so unlucky? There is always some
misfortune waiting to befall him.” Han Sen was planning to go after
Wang Yuhang, but then stopped and went towards the blood spring
instead.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Qin Xuan asked, from behind.</p>
<p>“I’m just going to take a look, you get away first,” Han Sen
said, as he ran back.</p>
<p>When Zhao Heng saw Han Sen run back, he was amazed—but they
didn’t dare follow. They watched Han Sen run back all the way to
the blood spring, unable to comprehend what his intention might
have been.</p>
<p>But to them, right then, they thought it better if Han Sen were
to get himself killed. The Zhao family had sacrificed many people
this day, all to no avail. The creature they sought to kill had
gotten away, and all they had incurred were great losses as a
result.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care what the Zhao family thought of him. He
reached the broken rocks of the spring and jumped beyond.</p>
<p>Earlier, when he turned on the Dongxuan Sutra, he had detected
the presence of a life force inside it. He already knew there was
something in there. And now, while the blood centipede was away, he
thought it would be okay to take a proper look at whatever lay
inside.</p>
<p>Beyond the broken stones was a tunnel that led into a cave.
Inside the cave rested a blood-red egg. It was like a football, but
it was completely red. The strong life force Han Sen had detected
came from the egg.</p>
<p>Han Sen was overjoyed at the discovery. He had eaten the devil
ant king egg not too long ago, so he knew that this had to be some
good stuff, too. There was no life geno essence inside, and it
could be eaten to immediately receive super geno points. Its
consumption was a much easier process than absorbing a life geno
essence.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not expected the centipede to create an egg, but
regardless, he leapt over and quickly pocketed it, before turning
around to exit.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still wondering how he might hope to save Wang
Yuhang when suddenly, he heard a sharp, monstrous, shrieking sound
emitted from the forest. In the distance, he noticed many of the
ancient forest’s trees getting toppled in a wave that moved towards
Han Sen, and he figured that the blood centipede had sensed its
baby being stolen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not linger, and quickly ran in the direction Zhao
Heng had been running. He was much faster than Zhao Haiyang, and
quickly managed to catch up with him.</p>
<p>Zhao Haiyang looked back with surprise. Han Sen was directly
behind him, but behind him, the giant centipede also came. The
giant, slithering body was uprooting trees and spoiling the earth
as it rampaged towards them. It was like a crazed dragon.</p>
<p>“What have you done?! Why did you bring it back this way?” Zhao
Heng enquired, in evident anger.</p>
<p>“Me? Oh, I didn’t do anything,” Han Sen said, as he continued
running forward and leaving them behind.</p>
<p>Zhao Heng cursed Han Sen, praying the worst death would strike
him and strike him soon. Han Sen had attracted the monster their
way, but he was now leaving them behind like bait. They wished they
could kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was far ahead of them now, due to his speed. The blood
centipede, however, looked likely to catch up with the Zhao family
members.</p>
<p>Han Sen caught up with Qin Xuan who was still firmly ahead,
leading the escape. When he turned to look back, he noticed another
person of the Zhao family had fallen victim to the vile creature
that chased them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Han Sen grabbed onto Qin Xuan’s waist, summoned his
wings, and flew to the sky.</p>
<p>But then he heard the blood centipede roar. It was a hundred
meters long when looking down, and Hen Saw watched it spread
transparent blood-wings. It took off into the skies towards
them.</p>
<p>“Bollocks!” Han Sen thought he could fly away with relative
ease. He didn’t expect the monstrous foe to possess wings of its
own, and it flew with such great haste. It was much faster than the
berserk sacred wings.</p>
<p>“You run that way.” Han Sen gritted his teeth and returned to
the tangled forest floor. He put Qin Xuan down and ran in another
direction, attempting to draw the centipede away.</p>
