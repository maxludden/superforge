<p>Han Sen looked at the man with uncertain eyes, not sure whether
he was being serious or if he was merely joining in with the jest.
Seven billion was not a small amount, and generally, even the
richest of people never carried such money around with them.</p>
<p>“For that price, are you certain?” Han Sen, still looking, asked
the man.</p>
<p>“Of course I am,” the man responded, with absolute
confidence.</p>
<p>“Give me the money and I’ll sell them to you,” Han Sen said,
smiling.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I have seven billion in my pockets, at this
very moment? Give me your communication number and when I return to
the Alliance I will contact you and wire you the money,” the man
said.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Han Sen did not give the man his communication number,
just his virtual community account number on Skynet, as a way for
the man to find him.</p>
<p>Then, both of them exited the shelter together. Back in the
Alliance, they both logged into the virtual community and went to
meet each other.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe there was such a loser out there with
that much money. He found it staggering when the man immediately
came and saw him in-game.</p>
<p>“Friend, might I have a word with you?” The guy had a peculiar
face as he approached.</p>
<p>“What? You don’t want to buy them anymore?” Han Sen was cracking
up with laughter.</p>
<p>“No. Is that what you really think? I have a different
proposition, that’s all. How about if I give you fifty million, you
lend me the pets for no more than three days? I will return them to
you in three days, without a single hair on their furry coats
having been brought harm.” The man smiled.</p>
<p>“Fifty million is petty pocket change. This sort of exchange
would require at least one hundred million. But I can only loan you
the black cat. The white pet is not up for grabs, by any means.”
Han Sen immediately knew what the man was implying, so he tried his
best not to laugh.</p>
<p>“I accept that. But, when we return to the shelter, you’ll have
to play along,” the man told Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen then agreed. Without wasting any time, the man sent Han
Sen one hundred million and said, “I’ll buy you dinner.”</p>
<p>“Sure. We can have dinner, but you have to promise me you’ll
take care of the pet. I’ve had it for a very long time and I’m
awfully fond of it,” Han Sen told him.</p>
<p>“Friend, if you don’t believe that I, Lin Mei, will take good
care of it, then believe in Lin Feng. He is my little brother. We
have a contract together, so fear not.” Lin Mei patted his
puffed-up chest.</p>
<p>“Lin Feng? Who?” Han Sen acted as if he didn’t know the person,
with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know who I am?” Lin Mei was genuinely
surprised. But after a while, he smiled and said, “Well, it’s fine
if you don’t know me. Just know that I am a trustable fellow,
okay?”</p>
<p>“Do you know Tang Zhenliu?” Han Sen had to ask, as the person
before him really did look like Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“Of course I know him. He’s my little brother’s best buddy; they
even wear identical, matching pants together! They’re inseparable.
Do you know him, too?” Lin Mei asked in return.</p>
<p>“Then we aren’t strangers. I am a good friend of Tang Zhenliu.”
In Han Sen’s heart, however, he thought, “I can’t believe Lin Feng
has a brother like this? I’m not sure if they’re real brothers,
though. Or just cousins.”</p>
<p>“Ah, isn’t that remarkable? Well, if that’s the case, how about
you offer me a discount, on the account we have such ties?”</p>
<p>“No. Relations are relations, business is business,” Han Sen
immediately rejected.</p>
<p>They then discussed the details of their arrangements for the
remainder of their time in the virtual community. After that, they
returned to the shelter.</p>
<p>They both went to meet each other back where they first left
off. When Lin Mei arrived, he was holding his big-boobied
ladyfriend and had a displeased look. They approached Han Sen and
Lin Mei said, “Hey, that’s not very fair. You said two for seven
billion! Now you’re increasing the price even more?”</p>
<p>“I am too fond of them to part with them so easily. If you’re
still determined to buy them, the black one can be bought for seven
billion. The little white fellow is not for sale.”</p>
<p>“Well, that matters very little to me. Money runs like tap water
for me. Very well, I will accept the black one for seven billion. I
will buy the white one for seven billion, as well. The only thing
that concerns me is the happiness and contentment of my wife. I
will spend as much as I must, to keep her smiling.”</p>
<p>“Oh, darling! You are so wonderful!” The woman fawned and kissed
Lin Mei.</p>
<p>“I already told you; only the black one is for sale. This little
white ruffian is mine alone.” Han Sen, in his little show, was
adamant about only going for the sale of Meowth. Eventually, Lin
Mei conceded and purchased it. The woman, while holding Meowth in
her hands, was beaming with joy and didn’t complain at all.</p>
<p>Ever since, a yarn was spun from the Devil’s Mountain. It was a
tale that recited the desperate lengths a little man would go to
please a woman. This sorry man was said to have bought a useless
pet cat for the whopping sum of seven billion.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, did you really sell that pet for the sum of seven
billion?” Wang Yuhang’s mouth was wide open with disbelief as he
looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“He said he was from the Lin family. His name was Lin Mei; he
said he was the big brother of Lin Feng. If you don’t know him,
then he must be a liar,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Lin Mei? That womanizer? It had crossed my mind as to which
wretch could be a sorry enough loser to pay such a sum. It was him,
eh?” Wang Yuhang now understood.</p>
<p>“The Lin family really has someone like that in their midst?”
Han Sen was surprised to learn that Lin Mei was a genuine member of
the Lin family, as he half-suspected he hadn’t been truthful about
his identity.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang nodded and said, “He is real, all right. He is Lin
Feng’s cousin. He should be much older than him and of a comparable
age to Lin Weiwei. Before Lin Weiwei became famous, this Lin Mei
was renowned as a genius of sorts. It was short-lived, and a credit
that only applied during his teenage years. Before long, he became
addicted to the carnal pleasures of women and soon after, he was
widely referred to as the greatest loser of the Lin family. His
father, however, funds his every desire and as a result, Lin Mei is
very rich. The figure of seven billion is little to him. I don’t
stay current with what he gets up to anymore and he rarely shows up
at familial events, anyway. It was nice to get a quick sneak-peek
today.”</p>
<p>“A loser, huh?” Han Sen lifted his lips but didn’t say any
more.</p>
<p>As they continued walking down the street, a commotion of some
sort seemed to be occurring further down. Many evolvers were
running down towards the gate of the shelter.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang quickly started asking about what was going on, to
which someone responded a powerful creature had emerged from the
Devil’s Mountain and brought ruin to three different shelters. Now,
it had come here. Lu Hui had issued a command, instigating his men
to man rally for combat and halt the advance of the creature.</p>
<p>Quickly, many evolvers amassed and marched in unison beyond the
walls of the shelter, out to the trail the monster rampaged
along.</p>
<p>Lu Hui had already gotten there with his own little regiment,
but they hadn’t started their attack yet.</p>
<p>“If Lu Hui takes this threat so seriously, surely it must be a
super creature,” Han Sen thought. Then, he turned to Wang Yuhang
and told him, “We should go check it out, too.”</p>
<p>They exited town and when they reached the plains of battle,
countless evolvers were gathering. There were also other people in
their midst, who seemed to have arrived just so they could enjoy
the coming spectacle and watch the battle with glee.</p>
<p>After walking a dozen miles, they heard the trumpeting of a loud
elephant. Han Sen said to himself, “Is that the White-Bone Elephant
from the Devil’s Mountain?”</p>
<p>The same thought coursed through Wang Yuhang’s mind. They both
turned to look at each other, with a look fright on their faces.
The White-Bone Elephant was far too terrifying a foe, and in one
mouthful, it had gobbled up a berserk sacred-blood creature. It was
undoubtedly a monster from the upper echelon of super creatures.
With its hulking size, stopping its approach would be no small
feat.</p>
<p>They walked forward for another few miles before they saw it. A
White-Bone Elephant was hastily marching down the trail, producing
tremors with each step. The humans around it were like ants.</p>
