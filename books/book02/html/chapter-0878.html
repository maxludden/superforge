<p>“Mister Han, the thunderbull is there atop the peak. We saw it!”
Zhao Xuebin happily exclaimed to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The others excitedly chimed in, saying, “Mister Han, the bull is
there on the peak. Please, go and slay it!”</p>
<p>“You really saw the thunderbull?” Han Sen eyed Zhao Xuebin
curiously.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mister Han! Please hurry, do not let it get away,” Zhao
Xuebin hastily responded.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. He knew they hadn’t seen the
thunderbull, for they did not have what it took to scale the peak.
If they had seen the thunderbull, they would have also mentioned
the three-tailed fox and the thunder flower.</p>
<p>They were purposely lying to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Knowing this, Han Sen still smiled and said, “I understand how
you feel, but let’s be honest; there is no bull up there. For me to
go back up there would be nothing more than a waste of time.”</p>
<p>“Mister Han, we really saw the bull!” Zhao Xuebin was still
determined to make Han Sen believe they had seen the bull.</p>
<p>They each pleaded for Han Sen to go up and slay it, but Han Sen
knew what they were planning.</p>
<p>If there was a bull up there, and Han Sen did not kill it, they
could claim Han Sen violated the contract, and they would not have
to pay Han Sen with the vials of Angel Gene Fluid.</p>
<p>If this matter was taken to court, they wouldn’t be able prove a
thing, but that wouldn’t matter. Even if their claims were thrown
out the airlock, it would still be enough to tarnish Han Sen’s
reputation.</p>
<p>“Now, are you sure you saw the bull?” Han Sen asked with a
smile.</p>
<p>“It is up there! We weren’t mistaken,” Zhao Xuebin said.</p>
<p>“And you’re sure it’s the thunderbull?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, unmistakably,” Zhao Xuebin quickly answered.</p>
<p>“And there was nothing else?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Nope, nothing. Just the bull.” Zhao Xuebin believed Han Sen was
testing his claim.</p>
<p>“Then I will go and slay it.” Han Sen promptly stood up and
started walking off towards the peak again. Zero and the silver fox
went with him.</p>
<p>When Han Sen arrived at the peak, the three-tailed fox and the
bull were still there, locked in their staring competition. Han Sen
summoned Little Angel and commanded to both her and the silver fox,
“Kill the bull first, guys.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen’s combined force of sonic and thunder powers
coursed this body to gather in his fists. When primed, he took aim
at the bull.</p>
<p>The Little Angel flew up high with eyes aflame of a green fire
and swung her greatsword towards the bull.</p>
<p>Death Knell also went airborne, ready to trap the bull in its
tolling maw. Meanwhile, the Spirit Owl hooted menacingly on its way
towards its given target.</p>
<p>The silver fox gleamed with silver electricity, transforming
into a thunderfox. It leapt towards the bull fiercely.</p>
<p>When the bull took notice of the large host of super creatures
bearing down on it, it looked ready to scream in fright.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Sonic-Thunder Punch exploded, drowning out all other sounds; the
desperate cry of the bull included. Following that force, it
couldn’t muster the composure necessary for another cry for a long
time to come.</p>
<p>Little Angel’s sword slashed across his neck, forming a deep
crevice from which blood cascaded.</p>
<p>Before it could make a sound, something muted the bull’s
voicebox. Han Sen’s Flaming Rex Spike had been shoved deep into its
throat, drilling with a mutilating force and a green flame.</p>
<p>The silver fox and the Spirit Owl now struck the thunderbull in
unison, delivering a multitude of deep lacerations across its
flesh, draining its blood. The thunderbull tried to gather
lightning to discharge and dispel its attackers, but beneath the
barrage of fierce hits, it couldn’t do a thing.</p>
<p>The next moment, Death Knell appeared on top of it. Although it
moved slowly, the thunderbull could not escape amidst the artillery
of assault it was incurring. The Death Knell successfully landed on
top of it.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>The Death Knell tolled for the injured bull, and in its
devastated state, it could not withstand the sound. Its face began
to bleed and its entire body began to dry, crack, and ooze.</p>
<p>When the bell arose, Little Angel delivered one final strike to
the thunderbull’s head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Super Creature Thunder-Devil Bull Killed. No Beast Soul Gained.
The Flesh Of This Creature Is Edible, And You May Harvest Its Life
Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten
Super Geno Points Randomly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon witnessing the bull’s massacre, the three-tailed fox had
frozen. It initially believed it was only the two of them who were
vying for the fruit, and it didn’t expect so many horrible
creatures to suddenly appear and slay its sole competitor.</p>
<p>Super creatures were intelligent, and upon seeing its situation,
the three-tailed fox did not dare remain. It quickly fled the
mountaintop.</p>
<p>Han Sen commanded Little Angel to chase after it, but not kill
it. He wanted it to pursue Zhao Xuebin and his people down the
mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Zero followed after the fox, as well. The silver
fox, Death Knell, and Spirit Owl remained atop the mountain to
guard the flower and the dead bull’s corpse.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin heard the sounds of battle drifting down from the
peak, and with great glee, he said, “Han Sen was lying! The
thunderbull was indeed up there. Pah! It is lucky our little scheme
worked; he is too much of a noob to try to trick people like us.
You can’t con conmen!”</p>
<p>“I hope Han Sen and the bull both end up injured; if that
happens, we can kill them both at once,” Feng Lin excitedly
said.</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s happiness, a snow-white shadow began to
descend from the mountaintop, ready to sour their mood. They
initially believed it to be the bull coming down, but upon closer
inspection, they realized it was not the bull. It was a fox with
three tails.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Run! Run for your lives!” Zhao Xuebin’s face dropped
like a sack of rocks, and he quickly yelled for everyone to
flee.</p>
<p>Even if they used their Angel Gene Fluid, they couldn’t outrun
the fox. And not long after, the fox caught up with them. It swung
its three tails and wrapped them around one person, electrifying
him into charcoal.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Little Angel caught up and pulled the fox away from
the Angel Gene runaways. Zhao Xuebin and his people were currently
in terror. Not wanting to stay and fight, they kept on running.</p>
<p>The three-tailed fox was savagely attacked by the tag-team of
Han Sen and Little Angel, all the while they descended the
mountain.</p>
<p>Although the three-tailed fox was powerful, it didn’t stand a
chance against Han Sen and Little Angel. It wasn’t long before its
fur was painted red with blood; the foe would soon be
vanquished.</p>
<p>The fox acted as if it knew it was dying, and suddenly, it
started running back up the hill towards the peak instead.</p>
<p>“Is this thing crazy!? Why is it running back?” Han Sen asked
himself, in surprise.</p>
<p>“Mister Han, kill it!” Zhao Xuebin called back, as he watched
the fox ascend the mountain again.</p>
<p>Han Sen coldly replied, “I won’t kill it; this has nothing to do
with you. You wanted the thunderbull, right? All I saw up there was
this thunderous fox, and it is my prey.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen ignored the terrified collective and brought
Little Angel and Zero along with him in pursuit of the fox that was
headed back up the mountain.</p>
