<p>“I’m sorry, captain. I messed up,” Tie Yi said wryly to the
good-looking man sitting next to him, lying on the bed in the
hospital.</p>
<p>“Kitty cat, don’t feel sorry for yourself. A man can only grow
in mistakes. If a man had never made a mistake, it only means that
he is a dedicate flower that has never seen storms. You are still a
kitty cat right now, but after experiencing mistake after mistake,
you will become the true Tiger of Blueblood one day. Mistakes are
not bad for you. As long as you have not died yet, those mistakes
will nourish you eventually,” the good-looking man said with a
smile.</p>
<p>“Captain…” A hunk as strong as Tie Yi almost sobbed.</p>
<p>“To cry after being beaten is not Blueblood style.” The
good-looking man patted Tie Yi on the head lovingly.</p>
<p>Someone had seen the scene, he would definitely feel weird or
even amused.</p>
<p>The good-looking man seemed to be in his 20s, much younger than
Tie Yi. However, Tie Yi looked like a child in front of him.</p>
<p>However, as weird as it looked, there was a harmony to it.
Although it looked amusing, there was nothing to strange.</p>
<p>If someone knew the good-looking man, he would not feel weird
about it at all.</p>
<p>Lu Hui, the captain of Blueblood Reserve Force was only
twenty-seven years old but has the nickname Devil Captain.</p>
<p>No one knew how strong Lu Hui was. The Blueblood Reserve Force
members were like children in front of Lu Hui, including Tie
Yi.</p>
<p>The training schedule of Blueblood reserve force was most likely
made an executed by Lu Hui.</p>
<p>The nickname of Tie Yi, Tiger of Blueblood, was in fact from Lu
Hui. However, Lu Hui initially called Tie Yi “Kitty Cat of
Blueblood.” Except for Lu Hui, anyone who called Tie Yi that would
be beaten hard.</p>
<p>Then, the other members of the reserve force twisted the name
and called Tie Yi the young tiger, which later became Tiger of
Blueblood when spread wider.</p>
<p>“Get better and there are worse training waiting for you in the
future. Don’t think there is no consequence for your loss. After
you go back, your training will be doubled,” Lu Hui said
lightly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Captain, I will train harder. Next time, I will not lose
to that guy,” Tie Yi said, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>“He is no longer your opponent. However, it is a nice thought to
have. Keep it.” Lu Hui smiled and thought of Han Sen. Reflecting on
the details of Han Sen’s performance in the contest, Lu Hui curled
his lips into a strange smile.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to Daphne, he reported to Ji Yanran’s
office. Just when he entered the office, he smelled fragrance
before he saw his girlfriend throwing herself at him. She wrapped
her legs around his waist and held his faces with her hand, kissing
him passionately.</p>
<p>“My dear, you are so great. I love you so much.” Ji Yanran did
not expect Han Sen to beat Tie Yi and gain the post. She excitedly
offered her hottest lips, which Han Sen would never turn down. He
held her butts with his hands, admiring how plump and bouncy they
were.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran who was shy in general but seemed to be in a great
mood this time. She even unbuttoned Han Sen’s shirt and kissed down
his neck.</p>
<p>When Han Sen went out of the office with limp legs, he could
still hear Ji Yanran’s tempting voice, “This is a special reward
for you.”</p>
<p>“I love this reward.” Han Sen walked as he hung a little song.
Before long, he suddenly felt a chill.</p>
<p>Han Sen shivered and looked ahead. A woman in military uniform
was standing opposite him, looking at Han Sen coldly as if he were
an animal.</p>
<p>The looks on the woman’s face made Han Sen feel she was not
looking at a man, or even a human. In her eyes, Han Sen was no
different from a cat or dog.</p>
<p>If Wendy could be described as a cold soldier, then this woman
just seemed like a bloodthirsty killer.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had never seen this woman before, he had this
impression already at the first site. He could not tell why, but he
thought this woman was so scary that he would rather beat ten men
like Tie Yi before pissing her off.</p>
<p>The woman walked straight past Han Sen and surprisingly, knocked
on Ji Yanran’s door.</p>
<p>Who is that woman? How come I have never seen her before? Han
Sen suddenly had a thought. At this time, the most plausible
explanation for the woman who was not from Daphne to visit Ji
Yanran was that the woman was the other guard.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen did not know what the identity of the woman
was, he could sense that the woman was much stronger than him with
his keen perception.</p>
<p>Han Sen even suspected that the woman was a surpasser, otherwise
it was unlikely that she gave him a sense of suppression.</p>
<p>Very soon, Han Sen’s guess was corroborated. And night, Ji
Yanran was chatting with Han Sen using comlink lying on her
bed.</p>
<p>“That woman is your other guard?” Han Sen still remembered that
woman and asked casually.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is Colonel Annie. She is my new guard. Do not try to
flirt with her. She is a surpasser. If you piss her off, I could
not stop her,” Ji Yanran said, smiling.</p>
<p>“My dear wife, what is it that your family do? They’re able to
get you a surpasser as guard?” Han Sen couldn’t help asking.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never asked about Ji Yanran’s family, but he was so
surprised this time.</p>
<p>Even those captains of interstellar warships will not be so
extravagant that they used surpassers as their guards.</p>
<p>“Have you been following the news recently?” Ji Yanran did not
answer but asked.</p>
<p>“Not a lot, but I know something.” Han Sen would read the news
from time to time in case that he knew too little about the
society.</p>
<p>“Have you seen any news related to the Jis?” Ji Yanran asked
with a smile.</p>
<p>“News about the Jis?” Han Sen thought about it and suddenly
stared his eyes wide. “You mean the one who entered the election
recently…”</p>
<p>The next morning, Han Sen got up and teleported into God’s
Sanctuary. This time, he did not rush to go hunting. He decided to
go to the market of the Starwheel Shelter to buy some mutant beast
souls.</p>
<p>Even if mutant beast souls were not that helpful to him, he
could easily elevate them into berserk mutant beast souls with the
black crystal to make a lot of money. Such a good deal was not to
be missed.</p>
