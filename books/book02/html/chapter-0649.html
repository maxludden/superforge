<p>Unfortunately for Han Sen, it was a common occurrence that what
he was most afraid of was exactly what he’d end up suffering. Han
Sen began climbing the mountain, and his greatest fear was
realized; Wang Yuhang was also there, killing monsters.</p>
<p>When Wang Yuhang saw Han Sen, he was delightfully surprised. He
finished off the creature he was engaged in combat with and
enthusiastically ran towards Han Sen. He asked aloud, “Brother Han,
have you come looking for me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure.” Han Sen didn’t really know how to respond,
thinking of how unlucky – and how unlikely – he was to meet Wang
Yuhang here, of all places.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, have you heard of what’s afoot in the Alliance?
It’s major, from what I hear.” Wang Yuhang’s voice had dropped low,
as if he was whispering a secret.</p>
<p>“What big thing, Little Uncle?” Han Sen was never really
concerned when it came to events in the Alliance, but he asked
anyway.</p>
<p>“Only a few of the high-class Alliance members know about this,
right now. It’s currently on the down-low, but I fear it’s only a
matter of time before it gets announced.” Wang Yuhang paused for a
bit, inched closer to Han Sen’s ear, and said, “Someone has managed
to slay that creature in the First Shelter.”</p>
<p>“What creature?” Han Sen’s body shook.</p>
<p>“That creature that is above the class of a sacred-blood
creature. It turns out, they’re actually called ‘super creatures’
and it has shaken the high-class members of the Alliance to the
very bone!” Wang Yuhang spoke aloud, with envy.</p>
<p>After Han Sen heard what he had to say, he felt some relief.
Since there were more and more elites in the First Shelter, it was
only a matter of time before they could kill super creatures. The
existence of super creatures becoming well-known by humans would be
a relief for Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Who killed the super creature and how?” Han Sen asked Wang
Yuhang.</p>
<p>“It was a woman called Ji Qing from the Ji family. In a way, you
are her brother-in-law, but she is not a daughter of Ji Ruozhen.
She is only a cousin to your family, but she is far more talented
than Ji Ruozhen’s daughter. She has already been titled the first
genius of the Alliance and a star of hope for the future.” Wang
Yuhang trailed off for a second with a smile. Then, he shook his
head and continued by saying, “But they didn’t manage to kill a
super creature merely because Ji Ruozhen was so strong, but members
of the Wang, Lin, and Xue families helped out, as well. They also
hired many elites; three hundred, as a matter of fact! They were
elites who have not yet evolved but have maxed out their genes.
They aided in injuring the super creature for her, and many people
are reported to have died.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame such a feat is even more difficult to achieve in
the Second Shelter. The Second Shelter excludes surpassers, so once
we hit that level, we have to immediately leave this place.
Otherwise, our bodies will be dealt irreversible damage. It’s a
shame none of these events take place in the Second Shelter, I know
I’d join in, if such a thing were to happen!” Wang Yuhang sighed
and said.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked confused and asked, “All those people gave their
best to kill that super creature and many people gave their lives.
Were there any goodies? Why does that Ji Qing hog all the
glory?”</p>
<p>“She was the one who found an injured super creature and she was
the one who dealt the final blow. The others were just hired help –
sellswords and the like – who were paid beforehand. They got what
they were promised.” After saying this, Wang Yuhang lowered his
voice to tell Han Sen, “Plus, Ji Ruozhen basically confirmed he is
going to be the leader of the Alliance. No one will offend the Ji
family over the killing of a super creature. And if they can kill
one once, they’re sure to be able to do it again. With our
association to the Ji family, where we help her and she helps us,
fighting over such a kill would be pointless.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He knew it was difficult to kickstart anything
in this world. After killing the first, it was incredibly likely
more and more would start to die. It was only a matter of time
before someone maxed out all their super geno points. As time went
on, the snowball effect was inevitable.</p>
<p>“Did Ji Qing get a super beast soul?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, an armor variant. If she hadn’t, she wouldn’t be called
the star of hope for the future of the Alliance. With that sort of
armor, the First Shelter will become Ji Qing’s stomping ground.”
Wang Yuhang then looked into Han Sen’s eyes and continued by
saying, “Oh, yeah. Anyway, let’s get back to business. Why have you
come searching for me?”</p>
<p>“I’m going into the mountains to hunt a berserk sacred-blood
creature. If you aren’t busy, you can tag along.” This was the only
thing Han Sen could say, really.</p>
<p>“Brilliant! Slaying berserk sacred-blood creatures is my
favorite pastime!” Wang Yuhang was giddy like a child and looked
genuinely ecstatic to be able to come.</p>
<p>They both followed the ridge of the mountain. Han Sen ascended
the place carefully, in fear of any threats that may have been
lurking beneath the snow he treaded upon. He did so because he
hadn’t forgotten about the super creature turtles he had once
spotted, when they emerged from a small cave for a feast of red
mushrooms. If they were still around, and he somehow alerted them,
Han Sen didn’t think he’d be able to take on nine super creatures
all at once.</p>
<p>Before long, Han Sen safely arrived at the last place he had
seen the Red-Scale Dragon. Surprisingly, it had been a journey free
from any trouble.</p>
<p>The Red-Scale Dragon had not vacated the area, and he spotted it
resting in the valley.</p>
<p>The Red-Scale Dragon looked slightly different than the first
time he saw it. Its red scales were already crystallized. When
watching it from afar, it looked like a giant statue encrusted with
rubies. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>“That is one big chap.” Wang Yuhang saw the Red-Scale Dragon too
and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. He looked at Wang Yuhang and told him, “Little
Uncle, I’m afraid I am going to have to request your assistance
once more. If you would be so kind, I would like you to attract the
fiend while I kill it. As payment, I’ll let you keep half of its
flesh.”</p>
<p>“Accepted!” Wang Yuhang nodded, summoned a beast soul, and ran
screaming towards the red dragon.</p>
<p>He didn’t run too far, however. He stopped a good distance from
it, scrambled for some rocks beneath the snow, and lobbed them at
the creature. The Red-Scale Dragon saw its harasser and quickly
took off after him, seething with rage.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang led the Red-Scale Dragon up and down the slopes of
the mountain. Han Sen summoned his peacock crossbow and loaded up
his seven remaining bolts.</p>
<p>The Red-Scale Dragon was most certainly in berserk mode and a
result, its scales were currently much tougher than the scales of
an average sacred-blood creature. If he used the raven bolts to
pierce the scales, Han Sen feared they wouldn’t do much damage to
the creature. It was of a monstrous size, after all.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen prepared to repeat the tactic that had allowed him
to bring down the T-rex. He took aim at the red dragon’s eye. Since
the red dragon was not a super creature, unlike his previous foe,
Han Sen believed firing his crossbow at its eye was sure to have
peg a bolt directly through its brain.</p>
<p>Finding a sound location on the mountain’s peak to take his
shot, Han Sen waited for Wang Yuhang to draw the red dragon a
little closer before he attacked.</p>
<p>As the red dragon was led in a circle around the peak, Wang
Yuhang reappeared yelling.</p>
<p>“Run!” Wang Yuhang was screaming, flailing his arms like a
madman towards Han Sen as he ran. Something was most certainly
wrong.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart began to race as he pondered what might have
gone awry. He thought to himself, “What’s happening? Surely nothing
terrible has happened once again, has it?”</p>
