<h2>The Gourd’s Show of Strength</h2>
<h3>Chapter 858</h3>

<p>The earth was quaking as Moment Shelter rose up alongside the
Purple Mountain. Beneath the sundered mountain, gargantuan jade
roots were exposed.</p>
<p>The corpses of all the super creatures, and their Life Geno
Essences included, were each consumed by the tree.</p>
<p>Its branches spiralled out and up into the air. Eventually, they
reached what appeared to be an invisible ceiling, and above them,
cracks suddenly started to appear in the sky. They spread out in
the tangled manner of a spider web, suggesting the very skies were
about to collapse.</p>
<p>A new lifeforce energy came from beyond those cracks, and it was
quickly absorbed by the tree. Following its consumption, the tree’s
body became greener than ever.</p>
<p>Although the Gold-Jade Tree was primarily only able to grow
through Little White’s luck, the tree still lacked the amount of
nutrition it required. This was because it was still in Second
God’s Sanctuary. It found a way to make up for the lost energy by
absorbing it directly from Third God’s Sanctuary. Following this,
it started to grow again.</p>
<p>Moment Queen looked delighted and said, “Finally! Finally, I can
return to Third God’s Sanctuary once more. It is finally happening!
The *ssholes of that land better watch out, for I am back—with a
vengeance.”</p>
<p>Seeing the Jade-Gold Tree bring the shelter and the mountain
itself up high, Han Sen’s eyes couldn’t help but widen. He was
seeing something unbelievable.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s gourd shone gold, and it vibrated with a greater
ferocity. A black light began to seep and shine from its tip.</p>
<p>It was like a black hole, where a dimension at the gourd’s tip
had been distorted. Light and color were all being sucked into this
black hole.</p>
<p>“Has the gourd chosen to hatch now? Talk about bad timing!” If
whatever was inside the gourd was something good and beneficial, it
was likely that Moment Queen would opt to take it away and claim
ownership.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed Moment Queen looking at the gourd. She frowned
and asked him, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>She had followed Han Sen for a while and knew much about who he
was and what he possessed, but she believed the gourd he owned was
little more than a toy.</p>
<p>But the black hole at its tip seemed capable of bending
dimensions, and this made her frown.</p>
<p>“Nothing!” Han Sen wasn’t sure how to respond. He had owned this
gourd for the longest time, and he’d lambast the heavens for the
misfortune if it was stolen by Moment Queen now.</p>
<p>After Han Sen said this, he thought about putting the gourd
away. But the black hole on the gourd expanded, and it spit out a
strange manifestation of black light towards the Jade-Gold
Tree.</p>
<p>The tree was surrounded by this black light, and its energy was
being visibly drained from it. Like a physical river, the energy
followed the black light back to its source: the gourd.</p>
<p>The gourd was only the size of a person’s palm, so the quantity
of energy it was merrily absorbing was nigh unfathomable. The
lifeforce of the tree was clearly fading in response, and its
appearance was quickly robbed of its lustre. The Jade-Gold Tree was
wilting.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Han Sen asked, while holding the gourd in
surprise.</p>
<p>“Do you want to die?” When Moment Queen noticed that the
Jade-Gold Tree was dying and its efforts to break the sky were now
failing, she believed it to be the malevolent work of Han Sen. She
lunged forward to attack him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was prepared to evade, but before he did, the gourd
fired another beam of black light towards Moment Queen’s purple
shortsword.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>The purple shortsword was whipped out of her hands. As if caught
by a gravity well, the sword then started moving towards the gourd.
At the sight of this, Moment Queen’s face dropped aghast.</p>
<p>Although it was only a two foot long shortsword, the gourd was
only the size of a person’s palm. And yet, the shortsword was
sucked into this black hole, becoming trapped inside the gourd.</p>
<p>“What is this?!” Moment Queen looked at the gourd, failing to
believe one of her six Cog armaments had been taken by it.</p>
<p>The Jade-Gold Tree’s seed was forged by a king, and it possessed
many super genes inside it. It grew poorly in Second God’s
Sanctuary, and the items it grew weren’t as effective as the
genuine Super Gene ones. Still, the power these items possessed was
far greater than the power of any other obtainable items of Second
God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Coming into possession of such an item in the Second God’s
Shelter was an extremely rare opportunity, and already, the gourd
had snatched one of them away from her. Although it was quickly
smothered by her rage, Moment Queen was full of surprise.</p>
<p>At this sudden development, however, Han Sen was secretly
exuberant. He hadn’t expected the gourd to prove so invaluable,
particularly in his time of need. For one of those horrible Geno
Seed weapons to be so quickly consumed by it, he had the sneaking
suspicion things would soon turn in his favor.</p>
<p>“My baby gourd, suck her!” Han Sen wasn’t even sure if the gourd
would follow such a command, but regardless, he barked it out.</p>
<p>And then, the gourd did indeed listen. A black beam was fired
towards Moment Queen. She attempted to evade it, but she felt as if
she was being pulled back to it. Unable to free herself, her face
changed.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>It was Moment Queen’s little hammer, followed by the shield she
carried.</p>
<p>Within this strong well of suction, the six Cog armaments were
being sucked into the gourd one by one.</p>
<p>“Suck it! Suck it! Suck it!” Han Sen was incredibly excited. He
had believed himself to be a dead man, but when the gourd sprang to
life, things truly seemed to be working out in his favor.</p>
<p>Moment Queen wished to escape the suction but she could not
move. And amidst her hopeless bids to free herself from the
restraints of the gourd’s light, all of her new tree-born equipment
was pulled away. Regardless of what she did, the gear found a way
to squirm and slide its way out of her possession and towards the
gourd.</p>
<p>“Suck it hard!” Han Sen shouted at Moment Queen, as he lifted up
his gourd.</p>
<p>The black light continued to burst forth, and the purple crown
was the next to depart her brief ownership. The mist it once
expelled did nothing to keep it from being pulled into the whirling
black abyss stemming from the top of the gourd.</p>
<p>Moment Queen was shocked, having no clue what that gourd could
have possibly been. She had trouble fathoming the power it
possessed, for it to so easily trump and consume her armaments.</p>
<p>“How can Second God’s Sanctuary birth something such as this?”
Moment Queen asked in a tone of obvious desperation. The cockiness
she once exuded had all vanished.</p>
<p>“Kill her!” Han Sen lifted up the gourd and barked this one
final order in the direction of Moment Queen. As he did so, an
ear-to-ear smile materialized on his face, in merry delight of how
the tables had turned so suddenly.</p>
<p>The wings on her back were now ripped off, too. They were sucked
into the gourd.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the end. Moment Queen’s purple armor, the final
item, was ripped off her body. It became a formless purple light,
and in a blink, disappeared into the gourd’s trail of suction.</p>
<p>Moment Queen was now clothed only in her underwear.</p>
<p>“Little Moment, what were you saying?” Han Sen stared at her as
he held his gourd, and he spoke to her slowly.</p>
<p>“What is that thing?” Moment Queen’s spirit had been wholly
defeated. She looked at the gourd, struggling to believe that her
equipment had been taken away so easily.</p>
<p>Without the protection of her six Cog armaments, she could not
rebel against Han Sen and his contract.</p>
