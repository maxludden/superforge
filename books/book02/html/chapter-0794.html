<p>God’s Third Hand was a very famous player in the Hand of God
community circles.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, God’s Third Hand had managed to beat
out every other professional evolver Hand of God player, coming
first place in four of the annual Hand of God championships in the
process. His talent for the game resulted in others referring to
him as “God’s favorite child.”</p>
<p>In addition to his constant practice of the game, his legendary
status was achieved in a variety of different ways. And aside from
being naturally talented, he had a special hyper geno art that
aided his play.</p>
<p>Everyone knew his name in the Hand of God circles, but even he
had yet to beat super mode. His speed and reactions could not match
that of the AI, and it had been believed that evolvers were unable
to beat the master-level AI.</p>
<p>But now, all of a sudden, an unknown evolver had managed to beat
super mode. It was difficult for people to believe, and he did not
believe it, either.</p>
<p>He assumed whoever had won had managed to forge their identity,
and thus it was most likely a surpasser acting under the guise of
an evolver. That was how the cheater had managed to do it, he
believed.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand wasted no time in inviting Han Sen to match,
and he was keen to prove whether or not his theory was correct.</p>
<p>Han Sen had spent much time battling the AI to beat the hardest
difficulty. To keep going was pointless, but now that a real person
had invited him to play, his interest was reinvigorated. Thinking
it might be fun, he accepted the invite without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Win A Girlfriend and God’s Third Hand now compete.” The system
announced, as a special treatment for those who had achieved the
title Hand of God.</p>
<p>Hearing this news, everyone was shocked. They all quickly
scrambled to spectate the match.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand was very famous, and widely recognized as a
legendary professional with the game. Han Sen, who was unknown and
had just achieved the title Hand of God, was going to compete with
him. Intense matches such as this were rare, and only those widely
invested in the game could truly grasp how monumental an event such
as this really was.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know his one randomly accepted friend request
would result in this, and he at first thought God’s Third Hand was
just another average, run-of-the-mill player.</p>
<p>To be the very first person to send a request, you’d need to be
lightning-quick. So perhaps it made sense that God’s Third Hand had
gotten in first.</p>
<p>But even if Han Sen knew beforehand how strong he was, he
wouldn’t have cared too much.</p>
<p>The match started, and every eye in the audience turned to view
their hands. With bated breath, they tensely anticipated the
appearance of the first light to show.</p>
<p>Whoever hit a hundred lightspots first would be deemed the
victor. You could either grab the lights near you, or the ones
belonging to your opponent. Each lightspot was worth one point, and
one hundred was needed to win.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand watched Han Sen’s hands intently, eagerly
waiting to witness his speed. If he was too fast, then God’s Third
Hand would know he was just a cheap cheater.</p>
<p>Many people thought the same way as God’s Third Hand, too. After
all, he had been playing for many years, and not a single evolver
had yet to reach fifty-percent completion of super mode. And that
included God’s Third Hand.</p>
<p>Somehow, this previously unknown “Win A Girlfriend” entered the
scene and finished what was believed to be impossible. Few people
put stock in the validity of the win.</p>
<p>The first lightspot appeared, and everyone looked at Han Sen’s
hand. Much to the surprise of everyone, the hand moved relatively
slowly. The speed was remarkably average, when compared to most
high-level players. He couldn’t compete well in traditional
matchmade games if he genuinely played like that.</p>
<p>“Did he really beat super mode with such speed?” Everyone
thought to themselves.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand frowned, also thinking Han Sen’s move was slow.
But just as he went to reach his own lightspot, he noticed Han Sen
had already taken it.</p>
<p>1 : 0</p>
<p>“Whoa!” Seeing this, many people made a variety of different
noises indicating surprise.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand was faster, so how could Win A Girlfriend grab
the lightspot first? That confused many people.</p>
<p>Win A Girlfriend now moved to God’s Third Hand’s side, looking
as if he was about to steal his next lightspot.</p>
<p>God’s Third Hand’s face looked cold, and he did not believe his
opponent’s speed would be enough to beat him.</p>
<p>But this was exactly what he wanted. To fight him face to face
would expose his speed and reveal to everyone how much of a cheater
his rival was.</p>
<p>Over the next minute, however, God’s Third Hand felt as if he
had slipped into a sordid nightmare.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hands were not fast, and they were most certainly
slower than his own, but God’s Third Hand had not managed to grab a
single lightspot. It was so strange, it genuinely made him feel as
if he was having a bad dream.</p>
<p>No matter how hard he tried, no matter how much effort he put
into increasing his own speed, he couldn’t hit a single lightspot.
The audience was entirely quiet, as well, unable to believe what
they were seeing.</p>
<p>A legendary professional player did not have a single point.</p>
<p>It would have made sense if Han Sen’s hands were fast, but they
weren’t. In fact, he looked very relaxed.</p>
<p>But God’s Third Hand’s lightspots were all snatched by the
flimsy, casual hands. It made people feel pretty awkward on God’s
Third Hand’s behalf. And nobody could really understand what was
going on.</p>
<p>The true elites of Hand of God were even more shocked than the
rest of the audience.</p>
<p>They believed God’s Third Hand’s movements were seen by Han Sen
beforehand. It was like Han Sen treated God’s Third Hand like a
puppet on a string.</p>
<p>“This cannot be real!” Everyone started to think.</p>
<p>At the same time, they realized how scary this thought genuinely
was. The man was a legendary, professional player who had won
numerous contests. Yet now, he was getting wrecked by a person they
hadn’t seen before. Truly, this new contender was frighteningly
strong.</p>
<p>No one believed Han Sen was cheating now, either. Even if he was
playing against the AI, cheating would only enable him to react
faster. He couldn’t actively work to block an opponent from
grabbing a lightspot.</p>
<p>AI could not predict the decisions of a human, but even if you
did not directly compete with the AI, you could still manage to
grab lightspots for yourself.</p>
<p>For that slow speed to prohibit every approach by God’s Third
Hand was something not even the AI was able to do.</p>
<p>“It’s like he can control fate itself. This person is the real
Hand of God,” the audience thought to themselves.</p>
