<h2>Every Punch Is Strong</h2>
<h3>Chapter 714</h3>

<p>The Light Son of God was firing on all cylinders, trying to
catch Han Sen with his beams, but he couldn’t. No matter how fast
he fired, Han Sen seemed able to predict his every move, resulting
in a miss every time.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this was his opportunity. He knew he could keep
dodging the Light Son of God’s attacks, and all he would have to do
was touch him to claim victory.</p>
<p>The Light Son of God was ridiculously fast, and it was clear
that the spirit’s primary trait was indeed speed. But this came at
the cost of physical toughness; if the spirit was this quick, it
wouldn’t have the defense of a super creature.</p>
<p>He only wore a robe instead of armor, as well. This clue
suggested that the spirit did not depend on vitality.</p>
<p>“I just need to hit him. If I do that, I’ll have a chance. I am
only one step away from the Son of God’s reward! I have to risk it,
no matter what. What if I am given a super beast soul, or even a
super spirit?!” Han Sen gritted his teeth, dodging in a way to
position the Light Son of God exactly where he wanted him to
be.</p>
<p>“He can actually dodge the Light Son of God’s attacks like that?
This is amazing! But still, dodging alone cannot secure victory.
His attacks are too slow; he might not be able to hit the Light Son
of God.” Hua Ping was full of both excitement and worry.</p>
<p>He had watched many Second God’s Sanctuary Divinity’s Bouts over
the years, and Dollar was the only evolver to come this far. He
really hoped Dollar could win, and thus claim the Light Son of
God’s position.</p>
<p>But there was still a gulf of power separating the two. Even
though Dollar could utilize his magic dodging moves to avoid the
Light Son of God’s attacks, the speed of Dollar’s enemy kept them
distanced from each other. He would most likely not be able to
touch the Light Son of God, and that was enough for the spirit to
maintain his throne.</p>
<p>Everyone knew Dollar had opened his gene lock to fight, which
meant his time was limited.</p>
<p>Ordinary evolvers, in a fight this long, would already have
exhausted their strength and had their gene lock shut down.</p>
<p>Dollar was abnormal, it would seem. His fitness was much higher
than the average evolver, and it seemed as if he could last far
longer with an active gene lock.</p>
<p>But it was not infinite, and no one knew exactly when it might
fail.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen’s ability to hold on this long was not solely
down to his fitness; it was because he had Long Live and Jade-Sun
Force. Energy replenished constantly, giving him what he needed to
hold on.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was still bound by his evolver status, and while he
could indeed last a long time, he could not last forever. He would
still have to beat the Light Son of God, sooner rather than
later.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes were so calm, and his body was so composed.
Slowly, bit-by-bit, he was threading the subtle movements to lead
the Light Son of God into exactly the right position.</p>
<p>The Light Son of God, by this point, was madly attacking Han Sen
like a rabid laser-dog. He hadn’t noticed up until now that he had
been driven to the edge of the arena.</p>
<p>The moment the Light Son of God backed into a corner, Han Sen
made his move. Although he wasn’t as fast as the Light Son of God,
he was quick enough that others could not even see his body.</p>
<p>Even the spirit himself was spooked and taken off-guard by the
sudden burst of speed from his opponent. He did not expect Han Sen
to possess a speed like that, and he had unwittingly let him get
close.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes burst into flames. His heart pounded like a
hammer, as his bones and flesh vibrated. A white light coursed
through his body to give him greater speed.</p>
<p>He simulated the Light Son of God’s own energy flow. His fitness
prohibited him from being as powerful as the Light Son of God
himself, but it was still effective. And this was a move that went
beyond the audience’s wildest expectations.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fitness was two hundred seventeen. The fitness of a
super creature was around three hundred. The difference between
them was 30%, so there was no chance the spirit could utterly,
completely dominate Han Sen.</p>
<p>“How can he be that fast?” Many people stood up in reaction to
Han Sen’s sudden, blazingly quick attack.</p>
<p>“With a speed like that, maybe he can…” Fang Mingquan’s
excitement was through the roof.</p>
<p>Hua Ping clenched his fist and stared at Han Sen’s next move
with unblinking eyes. If this speed did not allow Han Sen to close
the gap and touch the Light Son of God, there wouldn’t be another
chance.</p>
<p>A lot of people held their hands, in the hope that Han Sen could
now hit his fearsome foe.</p>
<p>The Light Son of God was already on the corner of the
battleground, and he had been spooked by Han Sen’s sudden change of
pace. When he realized what was going on, he quickly dodged Han
Sen’s attack and went right past him. He managed to slip away from
the corner.</p>
<p>The audience could not help but sigh. They felt sorry for Dollar
because, after all that, the Light Son of God had still managed to
dodge the attack that had so much build up. His enemy was still too
fast.</p>
<p>“If you want to compete with my speed, you have a long way to
go,” the Light Son of God said with a mocking smile and disdainful
look, as he passed Han Sen by.</p>
<p>“I do?” Han Sen stood where he was and coldly looked at the
Light Son of God who had gone right past him. He opened his hands
and tried to grab the Light Son of God.</p>
<p>“It is useless to compete with my speed; nothing in the Second
God’s Sanctuary rivals me. You pitiful humans will never be able to
achieve the same.” The Light Son of God sped up again and created a
gap between him and Han Sen once more. Han Sen’s hand had not been
able to even touch his clothes.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s hands trying to grab him, the Light Son of God
simply pulled away even further. The people who were watching were
starting to once again feel weak and without hope.</p>
<p>But then suddenly, the Light Son of God, who was quite far from
Han Sen, had his whole body sucked towards Han Sen like a magnet.
He was thrown through the air towards his human nemesis
upside-down. When the gap closed, Han Sen grabbed his head.</p>
<p>“Let’s try that again.” Han Sen raised his fist and brought a
punch down directly on the Light Son of God’s suddenly-distraught
face.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Light Son of God’s head suffered a terrible strike, which
sent it backward. A large red mark painted the center of his pretty
face, and his nose had been bent out of shape as it now oozed
blood.</p>
<p>After that heavy attack, the Light Son of God’s body did not
slip away as he intended it to. He was sucked back into Han Sen’s
hand.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen struck again, his fist unleashing
the Elephant-Disc Punch upon his foe’s face multiple times. Punch
after punch it raged, the skull of his enemy clanging like
metal.</p>
<p>Every punch was strong, and even the bones inside rattled and
collided against themselves.</p>
<p>The Light Son of God was in total shock. He tried to squirm his
way free, to resist and fall back, but he couldn’t. Some strange
force drew his body towards Han Sen; one he couldn’t escape. His
speed had slowed down, and in this frenetic panic Han Sen had
managed to catch up.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>The infernal fists crashed down on the Light Son of God’s face
like a landslide. The sound of each punch was an audible pleasure.
The boisterous Light Son of God was like anybody else now, with a
bruised face and bleeding nose.</p>
<p>The Light Son of God wanted to block the hits that kept
pummeling him, but the force continuously sapped him of his speed.
His moves were still being predicted, and Han Sen reacted
accordingly every time. Han Sen punched him every time he made half
a move. Being unable to dodge, all he could do was flail his
hopeless hands.</p>
