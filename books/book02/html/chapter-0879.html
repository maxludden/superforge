<p>After Han Sen chased the three-tailed fox back to the
mountaintop, the body of the bull had all disappeared. Not even the
Life Geno Essence remained. The silver fox was licking its lips
happily.</p>
<p>When the three-tailed fox reached the peak, it howled. It ran in
front of the silver fox and leaned down with its paws outstretched,
as if it was begging for mercy.</p>
<p>The silver fox observed the three-tailed fox’s bloodied tails
and then leapt on its head, as if it was going to tell Han Sen,
“This guy belongs to me now.”</p>
<p>“B*stard! You ate the thunderbull and didn’t even save me the
Life Geno Essence! Now you are giving yourself a companion?” Han
Sen looked disheartened.</p>
<p>The silver fox spat out silver lightning to heal the
three-tailed fox. The three-tailed fox trembled in fear, and in
response, the silver fox looked smug. It jumped into Han Sen’s arms
and then rubbed its head against his chest, as if it was trying to
tell him to forgive the three-tailed fox.</p>
<p>The three-tailed fox seemed intelligent, and it knelt in front
of Han Sen as if it wanted to obey him, too.</p>
<p>“I was going to feed it to you, anyway. Keep it and spare the
cannibalism, then.” Han Sen then pointed at the three-tailed fox
and said, “Your name is Three-Tail, you got it? Now, follow
me.”</p>
<p>The three-tailed fox was well-behaved, and it quickly followed
as ordered.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned his beast souls, and with the silver fox in his
arms and Zero behind him, they rode the three-tail fox down the
mountain.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin’s people were now in a state of boredom, waiting.
That soon changed when they saw the three-tail fox reappear,
heading right for them again.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, however, they noticed Han Sen and Zero
were riding it. Seeing that menacing fox to be now ridden calmly,
they were shocked.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t find the bull, but look! I found a fox. Thanks for
telling me to return to the peak; if you hadn’t, I wouldn’t have
gotten myself a new ride.” Han Sen reclined on the fox’s back and
smiled at them.</p>
<p>Their disbelief was marred by the ugly looks of anger. Their
excursion looked set to have them returning empty-handed, since
they had failed to slay their bull. Han Sen, on the other hand, was
going to walk away far wealthier.</p>
<p>“It’s a super creature… By the sanctuaries! How can it obey a
human?” Zhao Xuebin may have been angered, but he couldn’t help but
respect Han Sen for being able to tame a super creature like
so.</p>
<p>“Now that I have the three-tailed fox, I can offer you
protection from the lightning. I can lead you up to the peak, if
you’d like. Do you fancy going?” Han Sen gave the people his
barmiest smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” Zhao Xuebin was still not quite ready to throw in
the towel.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, then.” Han Sen rode the fox and led them up to the
mountaintop. He did not make them suffer this time, and their
travel was without hindrance.</p>
<p>Only the thunder flower remained, and all traces of the bull had
vanished. But seeing the thunder flower, Zhao Xuebin and his people
became greedy again.</p>
<p>“We came here in search of the thunderbull, but alas, we could
not find it. But this flower looks special. Do you think I can take
this flower as a souvenir and gift it to my supervisor? He might
like it.” Zhao Xuebin made his request.</p>
<p>“It is not owned by anyone, and it belongs to any who chooses to
take it,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin was surprised by Han Sen’s words, but he quickly
thought something was amiss. He had an unshakeable feeling that Han
Sen would never be so kind as to allow them to take something so
unique. But a treasure had indeed been put before him, and he would
do anything to own it.</p>
<p>He thought about it for a bit and then allowed Feng Lin to
collect it, not daring to go himself.</p>
<p>Feng Lin had similar thoughts to Zhao Xuebin, and was also
afraid to approach the flower. Still, he had no choice but to obey
the order he had been given. He approached the flower and then
touched it. Gold lightning burst forth from the bud and
electrocuted him.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin was shocked, in a different way. He smiled at Han
Sen and said, “Mister Han, the three-tailed fox you have can
command thunder. May we request that it collect the flower on our
behalf?”</p>
<p>“Manager Zhao, do you think such a thing is possible?” Han Sen
coldly said.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin said, “Our contract was to kill the bull, but the
bull is no longer here. Can we perhaps change the terms so it
references us collecting this flower, instead?”</p>
<p>“A contract is a contract; you can’t go changing it whenever you
please. I came here to hunt this phantom bull of yours, and I have
no concern for anything other than that.” Han Sen was familiar with
how obscene the Zhao family could be, so he wasn’t too surprised by
their absurd request.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin obviously wanted to say something, but Han Sen
turned around to leave.</p>
<p>The people quickly remembered that the three-tailed fox was
shielding them from the lightning. If they upset Han Sen, they
thought he could very well allow it to electrocute them.</p>
<p>Thinking of that, Zhao Xuebin kept his mouth closed and did not
say anything more.</p>
<p>Han Sen then led them down the mountain and returned to the
mountaintop by himself again, so he could wait for the fruit to
mature.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin knew Han Sen was returning for the sole purpose of
obtaining the flower for himself, but he also knew he was helpless
to stop him. They had no choice but to pack up and go home.</p>
<p>A day later, on the peak of Thunder Mountain, the fruit grew to
the size of a fist.</p>
<p>A lot of lightning continued striking the fruit, and there was a
notable increase in the strength of its pleasant fragrance with
each lightning strike. Countless booms of thunder rumbled over the
fruit over the course of a day, and before long, it shone gold like
a thunderbolt itself.</p>
<p>The final thunderbolt hit the fruit, and after it did, the dark
clouds of the sky dissipated. The wind and the rain stopped, and
the only elemental threat that remained was the golden thunderfruit
itself.</p>
<p>The silver fox leapt out of Han Sen’s arms but did not rush to
eat the fruit. It approached it, and then walked around it, as if
it was contemplating something.</p>
<p>After walking a few circles around it, the silver fox looked at
Han Sen and then looked back at the fruit. It opened its mouth and
swallowed it in one large mouthful.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The golden lightning exploded inside the silver fox’s tummy and
burned his entire body, making him look like burnt wood.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and almost wanted to rush to its aid. But
luckily, his dongxuan aura was able to detect its lifeforce was
actually getting stronger. He remained where he was and did not
approach.</p>
