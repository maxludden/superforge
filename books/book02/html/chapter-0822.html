<p>For a long time, the fitness of humans had been nowhere near the
heights of the shura. But humans strived to be better.</p>
<p>Generations after their first meeting, the gap in talent between
the two species was still unbridged. But then came the discovery of
the sanctuaries, and after this, humanity accelerated in strength
as if they were cheating. While it did not change the average
human, human elites were capable of becoming stronger than the
shura.</p>
<p>Kids and teenagers were still particularly vulnerable, being far
weaker than the shura.</p>
<p>Humanity had many goals, and the humans of this universe wanted
to develop their kids and teenagers until they were naturally
superior to those of the shura.</p>
<p>It was a common desire, shared by not only the average, working
citizen but by the high-ranking officers of the Alliance, as well.
The latter of which were actively working towards it.</p>
<p>Humans below the age of sixteen were unable to compete with the
shura. At around the age of twenty, people who were fortunate
enough could develop the necessary strength to battle them.</p>
<p>The shura that humans most sought to beat were the royal shura.
They were the cream of the crop, and felling an average shura
fighter paled in comparison to the strength required to take down a
royal shura.</p>
<p>The Alliance had high hopes for Huang Xiao. In combat, talent,
and luck, he was the best in his age bracket.</p>
<p>He was born a noble but possessed a natural talent. He was very
fortunate, also. He spawned in the grandest human shelters in the
First, Second, and Third God’s Sanctuaries. Through this luck, he
was able to grow up both safely and swiftly.</p>
<p>All of this crafted him into who he had become on this day, and
he had been personally picked by the Alliance as the one to beat
the royal shura Yu Qielan.</p>
<p>Many people from the Alliance believed Huang Xiao had what it
took to win this fight, and if he succeeded, it would bring great
joy to them.</p>
<p>The only negative was that Huang Xiao was one year older than
his opponent. Still, it was an acceptable difference.</p>
<p>Huang Xiao was not only lucky, however. He was smart, wise, and
composed. Even in the midst of the pressure such a situation could
pose, he remained absolutely calm. And even with the added
provocation of his foe, he did not display a glimmer of anger.</p>
<p>Han Sen waited for the match to begin. He wanted Huang Xiao to
win, as well. It was about asserting glory for his entire race, so
he did not particularly care for who the fighter was—he who would
take the mantle and responsibility of such a prestigious fight—as
long as they won.</p>
<p>“Shall we establish a wager?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man’s voice was heard. Han Sen and Ji Yanran turned
around with much surprise to the sight of Tang Zhenliu and Lin
Feng. It was Tang Zhenliu who spoke.</p>
<p>“And what shall we wager?” Han Sen asked, smiling.</p>
<p>“Let us make a bet on who will win this battle,” Tang Zhenliu
said. “I bet Huang Xiao wins.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a bet; it’s a scam,” Han Sen said with a wry
smile.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu laughed, then changed the subject. “Han Sen, there
is something I would like to discuss with you. I was wondering if
you might sell me a Life Geno Essence? And if you can’t, lend me
your super pet so that I might kill a super creature for myself.
The prices of such favors are for you to determine.”</p>
<p>“I have one Life Geno Essence I can sell you, but in the
sanctuaries, I am a long, long way from home. It will take me a
long time to return.” Han Sen did not decline, as first-generation
Life Geno Essences had no value to him.</p>
<p>That aside, when the shura liquid became public, the value of
life geno essences would drop as it became easier for others to
slay super creatures. Holding onto one now seemed pointless
considering what lay ahead.</p>
<p>“Really? Where are you?” Tang Zhenliu asked, visibly happy.</p>
<p>“Let’s watch the match first. We can talk more about this
later.” When Han Sen turned back to look at the stage, the fight
had already started.</p>
<p>The rules of this fight stated no one was allowed any form of
external support. The battle was to be fought mano a mano, with no
weapons or armor or anything else. Humans couldn’t use beast souls
either, so Huang Xiao swung his fist.</p>
<p>When Huang Xiao swung, Han Sen was surprised. He had only just
become a surpasser, but still, there was fierce weight and strength
driving the fist. Huang Xiao’s body glowed with gold like a buddha
in the gleaming light that radiated from his raging fist.</p>
<p>“The Huang family’s Golden Buddha may not be very well-known,
but it cannot be any worse than Platinum Body. It increases your
body’s vitality as well as its simple power. He seems calm and
composed using it. Perhaps it isn’t surprising; when he first
became a surpasser, no one could beat him while he used it,” Tang
Zhenliu explained.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Huang Xiao’s fist hit Yu Qielan. The royal shura did not dodge,
but accepted the hit instead.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at them with wide eyes, keen to learn the result
of the hit. Most people from the Alliance believed Huang Xiao had
the edge over his enemy.</p>
<p>After all, Huang Xiao’s fitness level was over three hundred.
This far exceeded Yu Qielan’s estimated fitness of two hundred and
sixty. By all rights, Huang Xiao should have had a clear advantage
over his foe.</p>
<p>The result, however, was a little shocking. Yu Qielan somehow
evened out the attack, and no damage was delivered to either
combatant. In quick retaliation, they both swung their fists.</p>
<p>No one expected the fight to be so tense, so shortly after
beginning. Yu Qielan and Huang Xiao stood on the spot, their fists
flying towards each other in a flurry. The sounds of whipped wind
and clubbed bones emanated harshly between the fighters.</p>
<p>“This is bad. It looks like our intel may have been incorrect.
It would seem Yu Qielan’s fitness is far higher than what we
originally believed it to be. He can compete against Huang Xiao
without being at a disadvantage. His fitness must be over three
hundred for sure. There is no way he can be suppressed or dominated
as we initially expected him to be.” Tang Zhenliu frowned.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, too. The vitality of a royal shura was
naturally very high; Huang Xiao could only keep up because of his
usage of Golden Buddha. Not even ordinary celestial beings were
naturally that strong.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Yu Qielan hadn’t learned any skills to
strengthen his body, which was fortunate. But it was frightening to
think his body’s vitality was on par with Huang Xiao’s, despite
being all-natural.</p>
<p>Everyone watched the match intently, all in support of Huang
Xiao. They earnestly hoped he would beat his foe.</p>
<p>“I really envy the body of a shura. If humans were like them,
our power in the sanctuary would be unrivalled.” An old man spoke
enviously as he watched a video stream of the fight.</p>
<p>“Teacher, do you believe Huang Xiao can win?” a middle-aged man
asked the old man.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to determine.” The old man sighed.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man knew the old man very well, but he knew
through his response that he actually did not believe in Huang
Xiao’s ability to triumph over the shura.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man proceeded to say, “If there is not much
difference between their fitness levels, he could still have a
chance.”</p>
<p>“Do not forget; the talents of a shura rest solely in combat,”
the old man slowly said.</p>
