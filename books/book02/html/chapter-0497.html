<p>“Zheng Yuze did well,” on the stands, the chief of the Southwest
Galaxy troops nodded and complimented.</p>
<p>“Chief, I don’t think he is the match of Tie Yi. Zheng Yuze had
the all he got in his strike, while Tie Yi was still conserving his
strength,” said the secretary.</p>
<p>The chief did not mind it. “How much resource did Blueblood
Special Force put into their tiger? And how much resource did Zheng
Yuze have? The fact that he has such performance is enough to prove
his excellence.”</p>
<p>“However, we would have no chance to get in touch with the Jis,”
whispered the secretary.</p>
<p>“We did not have a big chance to begin with.” the chief thought
about it and then asked, “How are the other two persons?”</p>
<p>“Major Wang Gang was also an elite from his department, but he
is not as good as Zheng Yuze. As for the person recommended by Ji
Yanran herself, I have looked him up as well.”</p>
<p>The secretary looked through his files on his comlink and said,
“Ji Yanran and Han Sen are schoolmates and a couple. Han Sen does
not have much of a background. Ji Yanran must have pulled some
strings for him to go to Daphne. He had been in Second God’s
Sanctuary less than a year. Being a sacred-blood evolver, he had a
great foundation. However, according to his registration, he is
currently located in a remote small shelter. There are only 2,000
to 3,000 people there, so it should be impossible for him to gain
geno points efficiently.”</p>
<p>“I think that Ji Yanran originally wanted for Han Sen to be her
guard, and only failed because of the pressure from the upper
level. So, among the candidates, Han Sen should be the least
competent,” the secretary summarized.</p>
<p>The chief nodded. “Unfortunately, he does not have much to
offer. If he does, would be a good option for him to stay around
one of the Jis.”</p>
<p>As they were speaking, it was Han Sen’s turn.</p>
<p>“Brother, no need to be nervous. Just do your best,” the young
soldier that had a conversation with Han Sen encouraged him.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Han Sen replied and marched toward the stength tester.
In front of the drum, Han Sen took a deep breath, his heart
thumping and his bones squeaking. His punch traveled through the
air and hit on the drum.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a loud noise that hurts people’s ears, the number on the
screen quickly changed and froze at 111.1111.</p>
<p>This number was so neat that it looked like it was faked.
Everyone was dazed.</p>
<p>Of course, it was not just because the number was needed, but
mainly because it was such a good score. Up until this moment, it
was the third best.</p>
<p>The soldiers started to applaud for Han Sen, because he was one
of the Southwest Galaxy.</p>
<p>“Dammit, what’s wrong with the score? It must mean I am going to
be single all my life,” Han Sen felt quite depressed. He uses his
best to see how much he could get and did not expect such a
number.</p>
<p>Despite the unlucky number, he was quite satisfied with his
score. With the score, he could be counted as an elite him on the
evolvers, not to mention the fact that he had great space.</p>
<p>“Well done, brother. Are all the cooks on your warship so good?”
When Han Sen returned to his seat, the young soldier gave him a
thumbs-up.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But we’re not cooks, we are cookhouse soldiers.”
Han Sen smiled and said.</p>
<p>Because of his punch, lots of contestants were impressed by Han
Sen, but Tie Yi did not even look at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Naturally, Tie Yi could tell that Han Sen had given all he got
with his punch and even tapped into his potentials using hyper geno
arts. Although his score was good, Tie Yi did not think much of
him.</p>
<p>“This Han Sen is not bad. He does know something,” the chief
said, slightly surprised.</p>
<p>The secretary wiped some cold sweat off his forehead. The
discrepancy between Han Sen’s performance and his investigation was
a negligence on his side. Although the chief did not say much, the
secretary understood very well that he should not have made such a
mistake and the chief would not tolerate such mistakes every
time.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry chief. I will reinvestigate right away,” the
secretary said hastily.</p>
<p>“No need. This is the best test. Let’s wait and see,” the chief
said quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Although the secretary continued to watch the game,
he still quickly looked at the information he found on Han Sen
again.</p>
<p>The chief could be merciful, but he had to be committed to his
duty. Otherwise, there was no need for him to stay on his position,
which was utterly dangerous.</p>
<p>After the strength test, Tie Yi, Zheng Yuze, and Han Sen became
top three. Wang Gang’s number was less than a hundred and ten,
posing no threat to any of them.</p>
<p>The second item was Sprint, to Han Sen’s surprise.</p>
<p>However, this device was tuned to level 10 with a gravity of a
hundred. Without a fitness level of over a hundred, it would be
impossible for someone to run inside, let alone pass all the metal
walls.</p>
<p>After the game began, soldiers entered the device. However, the
result was not great. Eight soldiers had failed at Sprint. None of
them finished even 1/3 of it.</p>
<p>The gravity of a hundred was simply too difficult. Even with the
fitness index of a hundred, one could easily get tired, so it was
hard for them to maintain the speed and reflex.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. This gravity setup was clearly too high. With
the fitness level around a hundred, it would be more sensible to
set it at eighty or ninety.</p>
<p>Even Han Sen himself could not help frowning seeing such a hard
test.</p>
<p>One soldier tried after another, but they all failed. After the
better half of the contestants had failed, it was eventually Tie
Yi’s turn.</p>
<p>Although many soldiers from Southwest Galaxy wished Tie Yi to
lose, they were soon disappointed.</p>
<p>Tie Yi’s muscular body jumped across the metal walls like a
robot that was never tired. It looked like he was not bound by
gravity at all. Without a single mistake, he kept the same speed
and rushed through wall after wall, which made Han Sen gasp with
admiration. Tie Yi was indeed an impressive figure. Great fitness,
sensitive senses, and a perfect judgment of the bigger picture. He
seemed that this incredibly difficult Sprint could not trap him at
all.</p>
<p>“He really is tough,” Han Sen said to himself.</p>
<p>In the end, Tie Yi finished Sprint perfectly. As if he had done
something trivial, he returned to his seat quietly and sat
down.</p>
<p>The soldiers of Southwest Galaxy all placed their hope on Zheng
Yuze who followed. Unfortunately, although Zheng Yuze did
everything he could, he fell after going through 70%, which made
many soldiers sigh in sadness.</p>
