<p>Han Sen was still troubled, thinking about how he might convince
Li Xing Lun and Brother Philip to attack the royal shelter. Right
now, Qi Xiuwen had volunteered to rally their support, saving Han
Sen some trouble.</p>
<p>Convincing Li Xing Lun and Brother Philip would not be easy.
They still had the problem of the Silver Ladybug to sort out, after
all. Without full support from both of them, taking on the royal
shelter would be impossible.</p>
<p>Back in the Alliance, the Daphne was still under repairs. It
made him wonder if he’d ever further his military career and take
on more missions.</p>
<p>A beetle was slowly climbing inside a cage Han Sen had made, so
he lay down and watched it for a while. He didn’t understand; was
it Cryster or merely Cryster technology?</p>
<p>If it was Cryster technology, Han Sen couldn’t see the point in
this weak thing. If it was Cryster life, and they were the ones who
created civilization, how could they not have intelligence?</p>
<p>Han Sen had read a lot of books regarding the Cryster, but he
could not find out anything about the beetle.</p>
<p>“Still looking? Did you find out where this thing comes from?”
Ji Yanran entered, lay down near Han Sen and observed the beetle on
the table.</p>
<p>“Nope. I have no idea.” Han Sen shook his head and turned around
to look at Ji Yanran. He smiled and said, “Captain Ji, how have you
spared some time to come see me?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t be mad, but I really have been awfully busy
lately. I know you are the best.” Ji Yanran reached her hand out to
touch Han Sen’s face and giggled. She then said, “Your skin becomes
the envy of every woman. Whatever pills you must be taking, please
share them with me.”</p>
<p>“There are no magic pills, sorry.” Han Sen moved her hand away
gently.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you. If you didn’t take pills, what about the
smell? You possess such a pleasant scent, but you also say you
don’t use perfume. Don’t tell me a stinky man can smell good.” Ji
Yanran’s face drew closer to Han Sen’s neck. She sniffed the
tantalizing scent with her nose, which refreshed her.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking of something to say, but all of a sudden,
he shivered. Ji Yanran brought out her tongue and licked his neck.
Holding his jaw in a flirty way, she said, “Pretty boy, you better
tell me. Don’t make me punish you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I’ll die before I tell you,” Han Sen responded.</p>
<p>“Then don’t take it out on me for being cruel to you.” Ji
Yanran’s mouth opened, and she gently dug her teeth into Han Sen’s
neck, leaving teeth marks. Then, she brought her face upwards,
sealing Han Sen’s lips with her own.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to visit the training room to work on his Dual
skill while he was still feeling good. Then, he went on Skynet and
entered the official battlegrounds.</p>
<p>It had been a while since he last logged on and this time, no
one was sending him invites requesting a duel. It looked as if
people had given up on him, which made sense, since it had been
several months since he last came online.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to matchmake, and he was quickly introduced to
an opponent. When that person saw Han Sen’s ID, he was extremely
happy. The first thing he did was send a group message to his
friends, telling them, “Guys, I matched with Murderer Dollar. Come
take a look!”</p>
<p>“Holy smokes! Is that legit?”</p>
<p>“Wang, you’re not lying, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m coming!”</p>
<p>“Is that really Dollar?”</p>
<p>Many people entered the lobby to watch. After seeing Han Sen’s
ID, they were all super excited, and everyone kept extending
invites to their own friends.</p>
<p>“Guys, come look! Dollar is back.”</p>
<p>“Dollar is getting ready to battle. Quick!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Word quickly spread, and the venue was packed to the brim with
people. Han Sen had hoped to have a quiet duel, seeing as it had
been so long. But after randomly matchmaking, a rabid audience had
turned out in droves before the countdown had even finished.</p>
<p>When the countdown was over, Han Sen and his opponent entered
the arena. The man who was to fight Han Sen said, “Dollar, although
I am fond of your battle style, I won’t go easy on you. I will do
my best to beat you, in a showing of the respect I have for
you.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Han Sen had no prepared response. This was only going to
be a virtual battle—did things have to be so prim and proper? Did
things have to be so wild?</p>
<p>After the man said this, he went to punch Han Sen. The fists
came at him thick and fast, with a fair amount of power packed into
each.</p>
<p>“Light Thrust Punch? Not bad.” Han Sen was quick to move and
dodge the attack, of course.</p>
<p>Light Thrust Punch was the weaker variant of Medium Thrust
Punch. Due to its lesser power, it was quicker, but it wasn’t as
fast as Spike Jab. When performed correctly, Light Thrust Punch
could be cast consecutively, locking an opponent into a position
where they could only defend and not attack. Its ability to
stun-lock was special in this regard.</p>
<p>“Haha! I got you good. That wasn’t Light Thrust Punch; it was
Mechanical Fist.” After this, the person’s whole body began to
move. All of a sudden, his body transformed into a lethal weapon.
His fists, legs, back, elbows, butt, feet and knees became horrible
weapons, attacking Han Sen simultaneously without reprieve.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised, not expecting to come across another
elite who knew how to use Mechanical Fist. Although it was the most
popular fist skill, it was incredibly difficult to learn and even
harder to master. You needed a very high amount of fitness and
practice points to use it, so the number of people that were able
to take advantage of the skill was quite low.</p>
<p>Mechanical Fist was all about turning your body into some sort
of a machine, using every part of your composition to fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen had once seen a video of an elite who was exceptional at
using Mechanical Fist, and could use only his hair to take out an
opponent of the same rank. It was a weird thing to see.</p>
<p>Earlier, Han Sen saw that his opponent’s ID was “Dancer.” He
thought he was going to use rather big, open skills to fight. He
did not expect him to use strange and delicate skills.</p>
<p>Dancer’s body showed no restraint as he continued to attack.
This strong move outperformed every other fist skill there was,
too.</p>
<p>When the fist moved, the elbow moved. When the elbow moved, the
shoulder moved. When the shoulder moved, the body moved. When the
Dancer got in range of Han Sen, he could keep attacking. Although
the attacks looked strange, they were performed with incredible
finesse.</p>
<p>With this creepy, raging attack, Han Sen could only fall back
and dodge Dancer’s assault.</p>
<p>“This is a powerful Mechanical Fist. Who is this Dancer? He is
very good. He even seems to be suppressing Dollar, robbing him of
his ability to fight back.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know him? Last time he came third in the Alliance’s
silver fist fight. His Mechanical Fist is pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Sacred-blood royals don’t have weak people. To be able to go up
against someone like Dollar, you’d have to be an elite.”</p>
<p>Dancer was being really cocky in his heart, as this was the
exact sort of reaction he had hoped to receive. If he could beat
Dollar, the fame of his name was sure to spread far and wide.</p>
<p>But Dancer did not want to be heard for the purpose of simple
vanity, it was for the betterment of his family’s training
business. They focused on training Mechanical Fist, and if he could
use this skill to beat Han Sen, they would receive a lot more
income.</p>
