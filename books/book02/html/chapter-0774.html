<p>Han Sen was preparing to go out when he received a message
saying he should expect another visitor.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard this, he frowned. Visitors weren’t permitted
there, so he thought it was strange to hear someone was coming to
see him.</p>
<p>“Who might it be, I wonder?” Han Sen had a few guesses, but he
couldn’t count on any.</p>
<p>Ordinary people were not allowed to enter the base, so he made
his way to the reception area. There, he saw a beautiful woman
sitting. He couldn’t tell her age, but he knew this was a woman he
had never seen before.</p>
<p>“You are Little Sen?” When the woman saw Han Sen, she greeted
him with great enthusiasm and a warm smile.</p>
<p>“I am Han Sen. Who are you?” Han Sen frowned when he heard the
woman call him “Little Sen.”</p>
<p>“I am your aunt.” The woman seemed surprised at Han Sen asking
this.</p>
<p>“Aunt?” Han Sen was shocked, never before hearing that he had
aunt.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Sister Lan tell you that she has a little sister? That
is heartbreaking for me to hear. I was just an orphan, picked and
raised by my grandfather. I treated your mother as a true sister. I
can hardly believe she never mentioned me before.” The woman looked
genuinely upset, almost as if tears were ready to burst from her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen frowned. Understanding her identity in
the family meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>His mother said she never wanted to get involved with the Luo
family. She wouldn’t even let Han Sen learn the Luo family’s skill.
Although she never explained why, Han Sen trusted her and the
reasons she must have had. As such, Han Sen never bothered trying
to contact the Luo family.</p>
<p>“You are so cold. It is no wonder you are Sister Lan’s son.” The
woman smiled, and the sadness in her eyes had vanished. The change
was sudden and quite jarring.</p>
<p>“If there is nothing else for you to say, then I’ll be leaving
now.” Han Sen turned around and prepared to make his exit.</p>
<p>But the woman’s hands were like lightning. She threw her finger
in Han Sen’s direction.</p>
<p>Before it reached Han Sen, he felt its great power suddenly
approaching his body. It was thinner than a needle and sharper than
a blade, and its power was so great it instantly broke Han Sen’s
combat suit.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, not expecting the woman to attack him here,
of all places. It was fortunate Han Sen reacted quickly. He fired
his Elephant-Disc Punch to collide with the incoming hit.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Han Sen took a few steps back and hit the wall. His finger was
cut so deep, the bone inside was on display.</p>
<p>“Eh? You didn’t learn Falsified-Sky Sutra?” The woman looked at
Han Sen with great surprise; if he had learnt it, he would have
been able to counter her attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen was about to get angry, but upon hearing what she asked
him, enquired, “What Falsified-Sky Sutra?”</p>
<p>Han Sen racked his mind as if to recall something. Then, he
asked, “Wait, are you the one who gave me that unknown hyper geno
art?”</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and said, “I sent it to you, but it was
a gift given to you by your great-grandfather. Why did you not take
the time to learn it?”</p>
<p>“I am not learning something from an unknown source,” Han Sen
coldly replied.</p>
<p>“Well, it is no longer an unknown source. I hope you take the
time to learn it in the near future.” The woman felt awkward,
coming here to test Han Sen’s progress with the skill. She had not
expected him to have not bothered with it, at all.</p>
<p>“If it’s from the Luo family, then that means I’ll definitely
not learn it,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>“Why?” The woman frowned, looking at Han Sen. His answer had
actually surprised her.</p>
<p>“Because my mother wants no involvement with your family. You
have received the answer to your question, now you can leave.” Han
Sen gave her a stern, cold look. If his mom did not want him to
engage with the Luo family just as she herself didn’t, then going
against her wishes was the last thing he would do. He didn’t want
to worry her.</p>
<p>And Han Sen didn’t think it was necessary to learn Falsified-Sky
Sutra, anyway. Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse were better than it,
after all.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea what you’re missing out on? There are only
five hyper geno arts that have ten gene locks available to open.
Falsified-Sky Sutra is one of them.” The woman stared at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“So what?” Han Sen asked her.</p>
<p>The woman laughed in response, saying, “It looks like you really
don’t have any idea what you’re missing out on. If you don’t
practice Falsified-Sky Sutra, then you aren’t a member of our
family. You don’t have the necessary qualifications to join
Godslayer Shelter.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Did you not get the memo? My surname is Han. And
Godslayer Shelter has nothing to do with me. I have no interest in
joining there. And to add to that, I don’t think Falsified-Sky
Sutra is all that impressive,” Han Sen told her coldly.</p>
<p>Hearing Han Sen’s last few words, the smile quickly vanished
from her face. With a chilling voice she said, “You are just like
Sister Lan. You are so selfish and conceited. You don’t care about
anyone else, do you? As your aunt, I should really teach you a
lesson.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea where you are?” Han Sen raised his
lips.</p>
<p>“Wherever I am is a place of my own,” Luo Li said. Then, she
moved her body to begin attacking Han Sen.</p>
<p>Her fingers were like razor blades, shredding the very air. An
invisible force was headed Han Sen’s way, moving at a blisteringly
quick pace.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw it coming, so he simulated the Bone-Elephant’s
energy flow. Elephants trumpeted inside him once more, and his body
turned the color of jade. He raised his fist and punched the
incoming force.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>It sounded like glass being shattered. Luo Li’s expression
turned to one of shock in response, not expecting Han Sen’s fist
skills to have develop so strongly. She never expected him to be
able to dwarf the power of the Falsified-Sky Sutra.</p>
<p>It was just a random punch of hers, but Han Sen had managed to
crush it. And this surprised her.</p>
<p>Luo Li was strangely confident in her Falsified-Sky Sutra,
however, and she wouldn’t allow Han Sen to resist her powers.</p>
<p>They were both evolvers. Luo Li did not believe herself to be
invincible, but she didn’t believe anyone could beat her if they
had not learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra.</p>
<p>In Luo Li’s eyes, she thought only Luo Lan had sufficient power
to beat her. She always considered her sister to be her greatest
opponent and greatest target. She could not allow herself to lose
against her son, and she would not allow herself to lose against
someone who had not even bothered to practice the Falsified-Sky
Sutra.</p>
<p>An invisible power burst forth from her. Her hair waved like a
madwoman’s, floating in the air. Her hands became like blades,
swinging towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>The invisible power was like an indestructible blade. It sliced
through the air as it traveled towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Luo Li’s hands did not stop moving, as if she were a frenzied
witch. Her hands became the invisible blades, attacking Han Sen
without a single glimmer of restraint.</p>
