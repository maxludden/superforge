<p>Han Sen did not say anything more, but he found the idea of
killing Huang Mian to be distasteful. It was just as Chen Ran
thought, though; Han Sen did want to use words to bring about an
end to the fight and conserve his energy. He didn’t want to reveal
his secret weapon to Chen Ran by using it on Huang Mian first,
either.</p>
<p>Han Sen had come to learn a lot about Chen Ran; he was a smart,
old fox. If Han Sen brought out his peacock crossbow to end the
fight against Huang Mian now, he’d be running off before the corpse
of his most ardent follower hit the ground.</p>
<p>The skills of the Chen family were no joke, and they were
amongst the best the Alliance had. Han Sen did not believe he had
what it took to keep the old fox where he was.</p>
<p>But the old fox had dared to come after him, and so, Han Sen
would not let him escape so easily.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized Huang Mian had made his decision and was not
willing to budge, regardless of the consequences. He had no choice
but to continue fighting.</p>
<p>Han Sen was aware of the old man’s true intentions, however. He
knew Chen Ran wanted Huang Mian to drain him of all his energy by
keeping his gene lock open. And so, when Chen Ran made his move,
he’d lack the energy required to fight back.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t concerned about this plan Chen Ran had
concocted, because he had learned the Third Mantra “Long Live” and
Jade-Sun Force. He could have his gene lock active for far longer
than usual. Even if he was too tired to open his gene lock against
Chen Ran, Han Sen would only have to summon his peacock crossbow,
take aim, and pull the trigger to blast him to smithereens.</p>
<p>If he could not use words to send Huang Mian away, he would
continue his current engagement and take the time to learn what he
could from him, from his posture with the sword to the details of
his sword skills.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s sword skills were powerful, but he was not
particularly great when it came to the acute wielding of the
weaponry. Now that he had seen what a true master could do with a
sword, he believed he had learnt a lot more.</p>
<p>Just by watching Huang Mian use a sword, he preferred to think
of this entire ordeal as an educational experience.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t allow his mind to be led astray by anything else.
He remained focused on the observation of his opponent’s movements
and thought about what he could learn and adopt. Through this
fight, he hoped he would be able to employ a thing or two of what
he had seen.</p>
<p>As Han Sen continued to fight against Huang Mian, Chen Ran was
firm in the belief that Han Sen did not have any more skills to use
or tricks up his sleeve.</p>
<p>If he had, how could he not have beaten Huang Mian by now? If he
continued going like this, even if he did manage to defeat Huang
Mian, he would be too worn out to resist capture.</p>
<p>Chen Ran was not in a rush, so he continued to watch. He wanted
to ensure Han Sen’s capture and was willing to wait as long as it
took.</p>
<p>One hour later, Huang Mian’s power was beginning to wind down.
With constant fighting, the time one could keep their gene lock
open was considerably shorter. This was happening to Huang Mian,
and he was struggling to maintain his composure.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not going to let this opportunity pass him by, so he
exerted more and more power into his attacks in order to strike
Huang Mian down.</p>
<p>Chen Ran noticed how Huang Mian was struggling to keep up, and
he had seen enough. He knew all about the power of Han Sen’s
fighting abilities, so he did not hesitate to summon clouds to
swirl around his body and bring out his Anser sword. Then, he leapt
into the fray to fight alongside Huang Mian.</p>
<p>The skills of the Chen family were powerful. Compared to Chen
Ran, Zhu Ting was just a rookie. Chen Ran was like some strange
bird, swerving from left to right in an unpredictable manner.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s two swords now had to block Huang Mian and Chen Ran’s
attacks simultaneously, which made him clumsy. Chen Ran’s movements
were too strange, and he didn’t even have to touch the floor. He
was flying, more often than not, and the entire spectacle didn’t
even seem human. He made many unexpected moves.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The silver snake sword clashed against the Anser sword, and it
was a strange sensation. Chen Ran’s sword felt like a cloud, and
Han Sen briefly thought his sword had hit a spring. After hitting
it, his sword bounced back strongly, which forced him to take a few
steps back.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you surrender now, I will spare your life. You are
friends with Zhu Ting, after all.” Chen Ran attacked as he tried to
talk Han Sen into submitting and to extinguish his will to continue
fighting.</p>
<p>“Old Chen, if you leave now, I will spare your life. You are
related to Zhu Ting, after all.” Han Sen was not mad, instead, he
smiled as he spoke.</p>
<p>“You are a stubborn boy.” Chen Ran’s eyes went cold and he
applied more strength to the fury of his Anser sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen was battling two opponents at once, and despite the
disadvantage, neither of them was able to deal any damage to him.
Han Sen’s body was unbelievably light and graceful, and it was
startling to see him remain calm under the attacks of two elites at
once.</p>
<p>“You really know Heavenly Go, don’t you? Did the Queen teach
you? How dare they break the oath that was sworn! It looks to me as
if Huangfu Xiong Cheng doesn’t want to live,” Chen Ran shouted.</p>
<p>“Even if the Queen did teach me Heavenly Go, what does it have
to do with you? This skill is a legacy of the Huangfu family. They
can teach whomever they please; there is no need for them to adhere
to your petty, mistaken whims,” Han Sen sternly rebutted.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Heavenly Go had something to do with the Chen
family; otherwise, why would Chen Ran care so dearly? For this, Han
San wanted to push it. Han Sen had always wondered why the Queen
was the only who had been able to learn it. No matter how difficult
the skill was to learn, there were many students in the Ares
Martial Hall. It would be impossible for them not to select another
student to learn Heavenly Go.</p>
<p>“Huh, Huangfu family is teaching Heavenly Go? If it still
belonged to the Chen family, none would be able to dodge our Seven
Twist,” Chen Ran said.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows Heavenly Go belongs to the Huangfu family. Since
when did it become a skill of the Chen family? Come on! Don’t
bullshit me,” Han Sen said, in an attempt to further aggravate Chen
Ran.</p>
<p>An old fox like Chen Ran knew what Han Sen was trying to do, but
he coldly said, “You don’t have to try to push me. After I capture
you, I am going ask Huangfu Xiong Cheng himself. Then I can see
what reason he has for not giving me back my Heavenly Go.”</p>
<p>After that, the clouds blazed out of Chen Ran wildly. The
attacks of the Anser sword came faster and faster. He wasn’t aiming
for Han Sen’s weak spots, either; he was going for his limbs in an
attempt to disable him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to deal with Huang Mian’s attacks, but as for
the old fox, he really was displaying the power of someone who had
lived in the Second Shelter for over a hundred years. His fitness
was so powerful and the progress of his gene lock was
incredible.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hands became numb every time his swords went up
against Chen Ran’s. His chest rumbled, as if he was going to spill
blood.</p>
<p>“What an asshole. He is so powerful and only conspires to hurt
others,” Han Sen swore in his heart.</p>
<p>But now that Han Sen thought about it, Chen Ran wasn’t too
dissimilar to who he himself was. This realization quelled his
swearing.</p>
<p>“Old Chen, you can leave now. Cease your attacks immediately. If
you don’t, don’t blame me for what happens next.”</p>
<p>“Assuming you don’t mind, I’d like to see what happens next.”
Chen Ran coldly laughed. He believed Han Sen had reached the end of
his tether, and his gene lock was on the verge of exhausting him
fully.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind.” Han Sen took a step back and summoned his
peacock crossbow. He pulled a raven feather out of his quiver and
loaded it, as quick as he could.</p>
