<p>Han Sen couldn’t think of a solution to the predicament he was
in, so he thought about sending his mother a message. He had hoped
to maybe receive some help from his mother, and perhaps get a
glimpse of the true extent of her power.</p>
<p>“Figure it out yourself.” The text reply was those four simple
words.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and gave a wry smile. His hopes were
quickly dashed, so he gave up on the idea of consulting his mother
on this. Now, he knew he had to sort it out himself.</p>
<p>“I doubt I can outrun it. It really seems the only way out of
this is to kill the thing. But the fairy’s body is so strong that
not even my Elephant-Rex Strike was able to damage it. How on earth
can I kill something that strong?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was still in the midst of these thoughts, his
communicator rang. There was a message.</p>
<p>The message came from a number that was unknown to him.
Alongside the text there was a video, and it was showcasing a hyper
geno art.</p>
<p>But this hyper geno art did not have any instructions, and its
ending was cut-off. Even its title wasn’t there. That being said,
the explanation was very detailed.</p>
<p>“Wrong number, maybe?” Han Sen took a peek and was quickly
attracted by its contents. Giving it a proper read, he was shocked
at what it contained.</p>
<p>If this hyper geno art was genuine, it supposed that you could
unleash your elemental powers before achieving the rank of a
celestial being. Such a power would unleash massive damage.</p>
<p>“A hyper geno art of this magnitude was sent to the wrong
number? That’s a little hard to believe. There has to be more to
this than meets the eye.” Han Sen thought, so he decided to reply
to the message. “Hello. How are you? I think you sent this to the
wrong person.”</p>
<p>If the person really did send it to an incorrect address, it
would be easy for them to learn who the recipient was. It would be
impossible for Han Sen to hide or deny the fact he had received the
message, so there was no point in lying.</p>
<p>“No. I was correct,” the person quickly replied.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. He frowned and sent another message. “You
know who I am?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” The person on the other end sent those two measly
words.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why are you providing me with this hyper geno
art?” Han Sen was intrigued, and so he responded with haste.</p>
<p>“You deserve it. If there is anything you do not understand
during its training, feel free to message me.” It wasn’t the answer
Han Sen wanted, but at least the person on the other end was now
typing complete, lengthy sentences.</p>
<p>Han Sen sent another message, but he received no response.</p>
<p>“What does a ‘bright day’ mean?” Han Sen read the hyper geno
art, selected the two words and messaged the person on the other
end.</p>
<p>To this, the person on the other end instantly replied and
explained its meaning.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked again, but like before, this
question went unanswered. It was fairly obvious by now that this
person was only willing to talk about the hyper geno art. Anything
else was met with silence.</p>
<p>But Han Sen himself now went quiet. The hyper geno art appeared
strange, and it was delivered by a person who seemed quite fishy.
Anyone would have exercised caution if they were in Han Sen’s boots
right then.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over the hyper geno art quite a few times and
came to understand that it was indeed quite a powerful skill. The
details were very well-explained, so it didn’t seem possible for it
to be a knock-off. Han Sen believed it to be the real deal.</p>
<p>If he successfully learnt this hyper geno art, it might be what
was needed for the little angel to wipe out the little fairy. The
only problem was the way in which it had been delivered. It came
into his possession quite strangely, and Han Sen wasn’t sure why
anyone would be willing to send him such a special hyper geno art
willy-nilly. Han Sen wondered what the person sought to achieve, by
giving it to him.</p>
<p>At this time, on another planet, a middle-aged man had a cruel
expression on his face. He sat inside a pavilion, drinking tea. All
the while, he watched fish swim about in a pond.</p>
<p>In the center of the pavilion was a stone table, and sitting
near it was a beautiful woman. She was engaged with a laptop. She
put it down and said with a smile, “Do you think that guy will go
ahead and learn it?”</p>
<p>“He has to.” The man did not move his head or avert his gaze
from the fish.</p>
<p>“What if he doesn’t?” The beautiful woman asked, with some
excitement over the entire affair.</p>
<p>“He will. He may not be Luo in name, but he still shares our
blood. He is carrying our genes and so, he will learn it,” the man
explained, without lifting his head. His voice was calm and
composed, and it oozed confidence.</p>
<p>“But his body’s blood isn’t solely from the Luo family.” The
beautiful woman squinted her eyes and continued by saying, “Lady
Lan has been gone for many years. She tried everything she could to
get away from us. Why bother them now?”</p>
<p>“This is the fate of the Luo family; it is not something we can
escape.” The man’s eyes looked strange.</p>
<p>“If, I was just saying ‘if,’ he did not learn it.” The woman
increased her tone of voice deliberately.</p>
<p>The man now slowly turned around. He stared at the woman for a
while and then said, “He will learn it. No ifs, no buts. If he does
not learn it, then that means he is not one of ours.”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman was silenced and she did not say anything
else. She maintained the silence between them in the pavilion, and
simply listened to the gentle wind that caressed them both.</p>
<p>On Planet Roca, Luo Sulan placed her hands on her cheeks and
daydreamed in front of her desk. She sighed and thought, “I can
only suppose they are aware of Han Sen’s existence by now. The
Falsified-Sky Sutra is in Han Sen’s hands by now, most probably.
Can he resist the temptation of its learning? It is difficult to
say.”</p>
<p>Inside the base headquarters, Han Sen turned his communicator
off and stopped reading the hyper geno art.</p>
<p>The Falsified-Sky Sutra was not enough to draw Han Sen in yet,
as Dongxuan Sutra was not inferior to it. The skill was presented
to him out of nowhere, and he was still not sure who had given it
to him and for what purpose. He wasn’t quite willing to accept a
skill he had no prior knowledge about.</p>
<p>And he still had Blood-Pulse to learn in the near future, too.
That wasn’t any worse than the Falsified-Sky Sutra, either.</p>
<p>This was one aspect of his personality that Luo Sulan made sure
to train into Han Sen as he grew up. There were some self-serving
modifications, however.</p>
<p>Luo Sulan formulated a base for Han Sen’s personality, and it
was only after he had been living in the shelter that it started to
complete. It even had his own style.</p>
<p>Even Luo Sulan thought Han Sen could not resist the temptation
of learning the skill. But what neither she nor the mysterious
figures knew, was that Han Sen had the Dongxuan Sutra. He was far
more powerful than they both believed him to be, and as such, the
Falsified-Sky Sutra meant little to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen logged into the Skynet and entered the Saint Hall
community. He purchased the skill “Sonic-Thunder Punch.” He had
finally come up with a way to kill the fairy.</p>
