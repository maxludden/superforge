<h2>Shocking the Alliance</h2>
<h3>Chapter 674</h3>

<p>Even though members of the Ji family did not believe it was
true, many others had come to ask them about Han Sen’s obtaining a
Life Geno essence. Many officers and organizations from all across
the Alliance came to ask them, all due to the belief that Han Sen
was a part of the Ji family.</p>
<p>Being in such a spotlight forced the Ji family to take the topic
seriously. Words of the deed also reached the very top of the
family, Ji Ruozhen.</p>
<p>“My baby girl, it looks as if you’ve found quite the man.” Ji
Ruozhen had a wry smile, as he perused the information concerning
Han Sen. He picked up his communicator and gave Ji Yanran a
call.</p>
<p>“Dad, you will be the president soon. How can you find time to
give your lonely daughter a call?” Ji Yanran said, with a sulky
voice.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Ji Ruozhen had been running for an
election to be president of the Alliance and because of this, his
care and concern for familial matters had lagged. His time for Ji
Yanran was one such consequence, but despite her sourness over the
slight neglection, she knew how busy such important matters made
him.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that; I’m only part of the election.” Ji Ruozhen gave
a warm smile, then continued to say, “Your father has been really
busy recently, but the reason I have come looking for you right now
is a matter that concerns my future son-in-law.”</p>
<p>“Why? What has happened with Han Sen? Has something gone wrong?”
Ji Yanran’s face changed.</p>
<p>“Something has happened, yes; and it’s quite the shocker,” Ji
Ruozhen stopped smiling to say these words with modest
seriousness.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Ji Yanran quickly asked.</p>
<p>“He might have killed a super creature in the Second God’s
Sanctuary. Could you aid me in asking around and evaluating the
authenticity of this tale, and…” Ji Ruozhen would not beat around
the bush when it came to communicating with his daughter. He knew
her well, and she preferred being told things straight—no matter
how favorable or unfavorable the subject of discussion was.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran showed a look of both shock and joy. She knew her
boyfriend was good, but if he had achieved such a dizzying feat,
that was way better than any of her previously lofty
expectations.</p>
<p>Because Ji Yanran wasn’t very talented in fighting, she didn’t
care much for the fighting world or society. She didn’t stay in the
loop much, but as with everyone else, she knew a lot about Ji Qing
and the aid she received in her own felling of a super creature.
The finances involved were high, particularly so for a single
kill.</p>
<p>But for Han Sen to silently slay a super creature of his own
volition, with little to no support, was remarkable and
shocking.</p>
<p>The Second God’s Sanctuary’s super creatures were much harder
than the ones that populated the First God’s Sanctuary, so it was
difficult for others to wrap their heads around how Han Sen could
have accomplished such a task.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran then sought to give Han Sen a call but found that his
line was busy; he was in a call with someone else.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran hung up her communicator and did not push further. She
knew it was only a matter of time before Han Sen would come looking
for her. She was sure of it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to the Alliance, his communicator was
ringing non-stop. When Han Sen took a look, there were countless
missed calls. The person calling him right now was Qin Xuan.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up his device and answered it. Qin Xuan’s image
leapt out, immediately saying, “I know you are busy right now but I
have to ask you this on behalf of my supervisor; did you really
kill a super creature? And if you did, are you looking to sell the
Life Geno essence?”</p>
<p>“I did kill a super creature, yes. It was a Giant Frosty Bear.
And no, I have no plans of selling the Life Geno essence. If I ever
change my mind and have a look at flipping it, I’ll call you up
first,” Han Sen said, smiling.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan presented Han Sen with a complicated look. She had
watched Han Sen grow up and always admired him, thinking he’d one
day become someone quite special. That being said, she never
dreamed Han Sen would be the first person to slay a super creature
in the Second God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Countless other factions had vied to slay the first super
creature, but none had managed it. Even right now, during the Ji
family’s most successful era, they had to pay a great sum of money
to hunt and kill a super creature in the First God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had killed a super creature in the Second God’s
Sanctuary quietly, with no fanfare or support. Such a trial would
have been unfathomably difficult in the First God’s Sanctuary, but
far more so in the Second God’s Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Everyone believed Han Sen belonged to the Ji family, but Qin
Xuan knew that Han Sen didn’t. She didn’t think the Ji family gave
him much help, if at all. He most likely slew the beast through the
power of his own strength and abilities.</p>
<p>It reminded her of the little boy who entered the shelter, back
in the day. Right now, that little boy had ascended the social
ladder and performed wondrous deeds that even the most
financially-superfluous nobles could not dream of achieving. This
thought made Qin Xuan feel strange, which was why she had a
complicated expression.</p>
<p>“Sure. Contact me if you change your mind, then. You must be
busy right now, so I shan’t bother you further,” Qin Xuan told Han
Sen, with a smile.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Captain. Talk again soon,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen hung up the communicator and then turned it off
completely. There were too many people trying to get in touch with
him. Half of these were people he did not even know, so he couldn’t
be bothered to answer the communicator every time it rang.</p>
<p>Han Sen left his room to visit Ji Yanran’s office. Now that the
whole world seemed to know what he had done, he felt she deserved a
more thorough explanation.</p>
<p>As he was standing near her office’s door, Han Sen saw Annie.
The way she looked at him this day was not the same as it used to
be; it was not cold, and it looked as if there was something on her
mind that she wished to tell him.</p>
<p>Annie was much stronger than Han Sen, as the two were not of the
same level. But now, Annie did not dare underestimate Han Sen.</p>
<p>She had heard the news of Han Sen’s achievement, in which he had
killed a super creature. Anyone who had performed a task as great
as that should be respected.</p>
<p>Han Sen did what he did without the support of other factions,
yet people believed he had the backing of the Ji family. Annie knew
the truth; she knew that the Ji family had not helped him in any
way and that he had never asked for any help, either.</p>
<p>The only help Han Sen had ever received from the Ji family was
when Ji Yanran exerted the influence of her position to obtain
Daphne for him. It was because of this that Annie had always
believed Han Sen to be a loser, leeching on the Ji family.</p>
<p>But ever since that one time, Han Sen had not used Ji Yanran or
her position as a way to receive anything. He killed a super
creature solo, which was staggering.</p>
<p>Annie knew how difficult it was to achieve half of what he had
done, and that was with support. Han Sen had achieved this all
without support and done something she had believed to be
impossible. He shocked not only her, but everyone else in the
Alliance as well.</p>
<p>Now Annie could no longer deem the name “Han Sen” synonymous
with the word “loser.” Han Sen was always so relaxed, calm, and
gentle with Ji Yanran. She thought it was just an act to attract Ji
Yanran, but all of her perceptions on his personality had been
altered. She felt as if she did not understand him anymore.</p>
