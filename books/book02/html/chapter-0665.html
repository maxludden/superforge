<p>When Han Sen saw the pegasi king arrive, the first thing he
thought to do was run. He stretched his legs and took off, but it
was to no avail. He wasn’t half as quick as the pegasi king, and it
caught up in no time at all. It landed in front of him.</p>
<p>The red pony leapt off the pegasi king’s back and happily ran up
to Han Sen. With its head, it rubbed him as best it could. Then, it
spit something out of its mouth onto the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look and realized that it was a fist-sized
dark purple crystal. The red pony used its head to nudge it closer
to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Is that… for me?” Han Sen, looking at the crystal, wasn’t quite
sure what to believe. He never thought something like this would
happen to him in this world.</p>
<p>Upon looking at it, Han Sen realized that it was a Life Geno
essence. It was most likely from the subterranean monster that the
pegasi and wolves had just killed. The fact that the red pony had
brought it to Han Sen was incredible. Han Sen was feeling as if he
had accidentally stumbled across a lottery ticket that paid out
five million dollars.</p>
<p>The red pony did not understand what Han Sen had asked it. When
he didn’t pick it up, the red pony grabbed it with its mouth and
spit it into Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>“You are too kind to me. There was no need for you to give this
to me,” Han Sen told it, but it was a different story in his heart.
Inside, he was alight with excitement as he held the crystal
tightly in his hands.</p>
<p>The red pony rubbed Han Sen’s leg until the pegasi king neighed
for it to return. Then, it did. The red pony leapt back up onto the
pegasi king’s back, looked at Han Sen, and made a noise. It must
have meant goodbye.</p>
<p>The pegasi king flapped its glorious wings and shot off into the
sky, disappearing in but a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Good things can just spring upon you. I thought my time out
here would have been a waste. I couldn’t have been more wrong; what
a delightful surprise!” Han Sen held the dark purple crystal in his
hand. There was nothing special about it, and it most certainly
wasn’t like the Life Geno essence of the Fire-Scale T-rex that
burnt so hot that no one could even touch it.</p>
<p>“I should be able to eat this Life Geno essence, no problem.”
Han Sen licked it. It did not melt as it had in the First God’s
Sanctuary, however. The dark purple crystal was like a real
crystal. It was hard.</p>
<p>“That’s strange; why can’t I eat it? Is this not a Life Geno
essence?” Han Sen licked it a few more times, but nothing
happened.</p>
<p>No matter which way he considered it, it had to be a Life Geno
essence.</p>
<p>“It looks like if you want to eat a Life Geno essence in the
Second God’s Sanctuary, you’ve got to do something special.” Han
Sen did not dare swallow the crystal whole.</p>
<p>Clearly, randomly swallowing a crystal wouldn’t be the solution.
If neither the pegasi king nor wolf king wanted it, there had to be
something up with the Life Geno essence. As such, Han Sen didn’t
dare eat it just yet, on account of his suspicion.</p>
<p>Han Sen already had a few guesses, but he wasn’t too sure. He’d
have to wait a while longer before proving whether or not his ideas
were correct.</p>
<p>He put away the Life Geno essence and continued his journey. He
resolved to return to Devil’s Shelter to see if there was any
news.</p>
<p>He heard Lu Hui had made a deal with the master that resided in
the north. They were cooperating to slay the wolf king. Han Sen
could only send prayers their way, for if the pegasi king aided the
wolves in their time of need, neither human party would return.</p>
<p>Han Sen had witnessed the powers of the wolf and pegasi kings.
Han Sen noticed that although he had the Flaming Rex Spike, if he
wanted to kill a super creature like the wolf king, doing it solo
would be no small feat.</p>
<p>Their fitness far exceeded ordinary humans. Due to its speed,
Han Sen did not think he’d ever have a chance of striking the wolf
king with the Flaming Rex Spike. And the wolf king’s power was
medium-low, on the scale of super creatures.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’ll still be needing help to make tackling super
creatures efficient,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Although he could not find help at the drop of the hat, the
least he could do was improve his own power. The Toxic-Dragon Drill
was clearly not strong enough to suit his needs, so he decided to
modify it and bring it up to par with an S-class skill. If he did
that, it’d be far more useful in his fights against super
creatures.</p>
<p>The best way to modify a hyper geno art was through combat, so
Han Sen used the scanner to scan the Flaming Rex Spike. He
simulated it in the virtual community, planning to practice it in
the virtual training camp and modify it there.</p>
<p>Han Sen logged into the virtual military training camp and
looked at his friends list. Xian Fei was not online, so he decided
to matchmake.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng had been on a roll lately, and he had just taken
first place in the Military Fellowship Tournament. Although it was
only for the league that used spears, he was still satisfied with
the result.</p>
<p>Even if it was just a single award, it wasn’t something easily
obtainable. Hui Haifeng had practiced his spear skills for a great
number of years. It was nice to see it pay off, somewhat.</p>
<p>He logged into the virtual training camp, preparing to practice
his melee skills. He hoped that in the next tournament, his ranking
could be even higher.</p>
<p>Quickly, Hui Haifeng found an opponent through matchmaking. It
was a person called “Little Soldier on the Battleship” and their
ranking seemed to be normal.</p>
<p>After entering the arena, Hui Haifeng was taken aback. The
weapon his opponent was using was very strange. It was two meter
long, giant sharp weapon.</p>
<p>It looked like a big folder umbrella. The metal folds looked
lethal, and the weapon itself was quite scary.</p>
<p>“What kind of strange weapon is this? It looks like a greatsword
and a medieval lance combined. But it looks so much cooler than
they could ever look. How do you even use that thing?” Hui Haifeng
eyed it with curious wonder.</p>
<p>Although lances could be used with one hand, that was best saved
for riders. Riders would use the speed and power of their mounts to
create powerful impacts. Battling on foot like this, with a weapon
held in one hand, did not seem particularly useful.</p>
<p>As a spear-elite, he thought the weapon was a little too big, as
well. It was definitely not a weapon that could be used effectively
as a spear. But neither could it be used as a sword. With its
cylindrical body, few skills could be cast efficiently with it.</p>
<p>The weapon interested Hui Haifeng greatly. He was looking
forward to seeing what skills could be performed with such a
weapon.</p>
<p>Hui Haifeng, who had come here with empty hands, now summoned a
big spear. It was two meters long and as thick as an arm. The point
itself was one foot long and made of steel. The spear was called
the “Champion Spear.”</p>
<p>Many people were able to use a Champion Spear, but few could
master it. Because the Champion Spear lacked the mobility of a
lance, its effectiveness was placed in the power behind it. People
who lacked the necessary strength or momentum could not use it as
well.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed his opponent was using a Champion Spear, and at
this, he looked happy. This was because the thrusting skill of his
Flaming Rex Spike was derived from that same weapon.</p>
