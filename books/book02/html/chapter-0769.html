<p>“Will you follow me along the path of evolution?” the man said
with a cold tone of voice, looking at the rhino.</p>
<p>“Roof!” the rhino responded to the man. Then, it began flying
towards the metal door. Hovering beside the man, it turned around
to look at the desert as if it was going to miss the place.</p>
<p>The man had a smile, and then he brought the rhino to leave. He
casually looked around and seemed surprised. Just as he was
preparing to lead the rhino through the door, he scanned the
creatures on the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen could suddenly feel that the man’s eyes were aimed at
him, and there was no chance of him being mistaken about that.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Why would I even bother looking at him? This man is
bringing whoever he wants. Even super creatures would not dare look
at him. It seems all I ever do is look for trouble!” Han Sen wanted
to slap himself.</p>
<p>Earlier, things seemed to be proceeding without trouble for him.
But Han Sen realized his foolishness in looking the man’s way, and
now, the mysterious man had him in his sights.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt incredibly nervous. If he could have run away, he
would have done so in a heartbeat. But he wasn’t the only one still
pinned down to the ground, as the fairy, black-flame phoenix, and
green kirin were, too. Han Sen’s chance of escape was slimmer than
ever.</p>
<p>After seeing Han Sen where he lay, the man looked upon him with
interest. With a finger, he pointed at him.</p>
<p>A black laser beam fell on Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Is this it? Am I going to die?” Han Sen used all his
strength to try to dodge out of the way, but try as he might, he
could not move an inch.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The beam of light struck Han Sen’s head, and his heart felt cold
for a second.</p>
<p>“It’s karma. I’ve been smacking people’s heads all my life. Now,
it is my turn to be smacked in the head. Maybe I deserve this, but
if I don’t have a head, will anyone be able to recognize who I am
when my body is discovered? That’s to assume my body will remain
intact; with all these creatures around, I’ll be chow in no-time. I
doubt even my bones will remain. Can I not even tell my family
goodbye?” Han Sen felt so sad in his heart.</p>
<p>But it was then like nothing happened. The beam of light did not
crush his skull, as expected. He felt no pain at all. It was as if
the beam of light was nothing but an illusion.</p>
<p>“You are my man.” The man lifted his lips as he spoke, then
turned around and departed beyond the metal door.</p>
<p>The holy rhino followed him inside, and then the door shut. As
slowly as it first appeared, it now disappeared into
nothingness.</p>
<p>Han Sen was finally able to move, and the first thing he did was
quickly touch his head. Much to his relief, his head was firm,
warm, and whole. He was super pleased, and so he thought, “My head
is still here. Yay! I am not dead.”</p>
<p>But a second later, he spared no time for celebration. He
summoned his Golden Roarer, and with the fairy alongside, rode over
to the sand crater.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Han Sen who went there, either. All the
creatures, black-flame phoenix and green kirin included, raced
forward. There were some bones and flesh that had been left behind
by the rhino. It was the meat of a top super creature, and clearly
the aim of everyone’s desire.</p>
<p>The black-flame phoenix and green kirin sprinted there, firing
flame and thunder as they went. Any creature that attempted to
steal from them, they killed mercilessly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had the little angel and fairy to protect him, however.
And quickly, he leapt towards the mound of flesh. He summoned his
Death Knell and lobbed it into the blood.</p>
<p>An idea then sprang upon Han Sen, and he chucked the gourd in
there, too. Although he didn’t know whether or not it would have an
effect, this was a remarkably unique opportunity, and he didn’t
want to let this chance pass him by.</p>
<p>The black-flame phoenix and green kirin jumped towards the meat
and began devouring it as best they could. Although they ate like
mad, they still managed to incinerate anything that came close.</p>
<p>The fairy took the time to grab a bite to eat, too. Her little
mouth worked incredibly quickly to gobble down decent chunks of
meat.</p>
<p>The little angel had her fair share, as well. So, Han Sen then
summoned Meowth and let it dine on some.</p>
<p>Han Sen was currently regretting his decision to leave the
silver fox behind. If that little silver black hole was here, it
would be in ecstasy at the prospect of all this food.</p>
<p>The rhino was incredibly large. Even though those two monsters
were slaughtering creatures, others were able to join in and eat
from afar.</p>
<p>Han Sen lay on the ground to have a sip of the blood, but after
giving it a taste, quickly spat it all out. The blood was like
acid, and it almost melted his entire mouth and tongue.</p>
<p>“What is this? Can only creatures consume this?” Han Sen was
disheartened, seeing all the other creatures jovially eat to their
heart’s content.</p>
<p>The little angel had no problem, either. It was only Han Sen who
was not able to take part in eating the rhino’s remains. Han Sen
did not want to give up so easily, however. Instead of trying to
drink the blood, he grabbed a chunk of meat and bit into it. It
tasted like lime, and it burnt his mouth fiercely. Quickly, he spat
it all out.</p>
<p>“Holy smokes! What is happening?” Han Sen’s heart was incredibly
sad, and his inability to eat the meat drove him nuts.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen remembered a tear had fallen from the rhino.
The tear seemed as if it had solidified, and he wondered if it was
still there.</p>
<p>From what Han Sen could recall, it fell into the pool of blood.
He snuck over to where he had seen it fall and rummaged around for
it. If it did not melt, then it had to still be there.</p>
<p>After a while, his hands touched something circular. With a
quick rebound of joy and excitement, he pulled it up.</p>
<p>It was indeed the rhino’s teardrop. It was transparent, and
about the size of a fist. Although it came out of the blood, it
hadn’t been stained by it. Strange, considering Han Sen’s hand was
all mucky with the blood it had been submerged in. It was fortunate
he was wearing beast soul armor, too. If he wasn’t, he imagined his
skin would have all melted away by now.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the tear and felt a lot of energy coursing around
inside it. The item itself felt incredibly holy. Merely holding it
soothed his being, as if being in its proximity cleansed him.</p>
<p>“Now this is some good stuff.” Han Sen was ecstatic, and he
carefully pocketed the tear.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out a bag and placed some meat inside it, so he
could offer it to the silver fox when he returned. He couldn’t let
the silver fox—the creature that loved to eat so much—go without
this sort of food.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen also harbored the desire to see the silver
fox grow up a little faster. An adult silver fox was sure to be
incredibly powerful, and if it never grew up, his investment in the
little creature would have been a waste.</p>
