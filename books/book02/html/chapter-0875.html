<h2>Why Has the Lightning Not Harmed You Once?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 875</h3>

<p>It took them half a day’s travel, all in all, to reach the foot
of Thunder Mountain.</p>
<p>Every inch closer that they traveled, the dread that the
treacherous mountain instilled increased. Lightning continued to
flash in the skies, striking the peak a number of times. Each flash
sent a number of broken rocks plummeting to the earth below.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why are there no creatures around? This is strange.” Lui
Gui frowned.</p>
<p>“It is strange. The last time we came here, there were many
other creatures. But this time, we haven’t seen a single one.” Zhao
Xuebin was confused, as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen jovially thought to himself, “Duh, that’s because of the
silver fox. With this cute little blighter by my side, creatures
pestering my travel are a thing of the past!”</p>
<p>“It’s better without them, isn’t it? We can freely slay the
Thunderbull.” When Han Sen said this, he immediately began riding
Golden Growler up the mountainside.</p>
<p>“In that case, we are depending on you,” Zhao Xuebin politely
said to Han Sen. After Han Sen took off, Zhao Xuebin turned around
and said to his men, “Be careful; the Thunderbull may appear at any
second. Maintain vigilance.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” They all answered in unison. Slowly but surely, they
ascended the mountain in Han Sen’s dusty wake.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lightning continued to strike, and not once was there a lull in
its rhythmic impacts. The thunder repeatedly struck the rocks of
the mountain, emitting wild showers of sparks.</p>
<p>Han Sen was ahead, but it wasn’t long before he slowed down. The
environment was fairly bad and unsuitable for haste. If this was
the Thunderbull’s home turf, he knew he’d have to be more careful,
as he’d be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The silver fox maintained its excitement by standing on Golden
Growler’s head, staring at the peak in the distance.</p>
<p>It took them an hour of travel to reach the midway point of the
mountain, but still, they had yet to come across the Thunderbull
they were hunting.</p>
<p>“Manager Zhao, perhaps that bull is gone,” Han Sen suggested to
Zhao Xuebin.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin wore a look of confusion, and he said, “Whenever we
used to come here, it would quickly approach our intrusion at the
foot of the mountain. Even if it was on the peak, it should have
descended upon us long ago. Today’s absence of the beast is
strange, indeed.”</p>
<p>“Did the Thunderbull really leave this place?” Lui Gui asked,
with concern.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep going; don’t drop your guard, though, just in case.”
Zhao Xuebin frowned.</p>
<p>They had been meaning to slay this Thunderbull for quite some
time. They had failed a number of times and lost many people in
their previous attempts. The bull could cast fierce attacks,
including AOE strikes; this was why they had to approach Han Sen
and request his aid. They were at their wits end.</p>
<p>If the bull had truly gone, then it would be a great loss for
them. The contract stated that if the bull had vacated the area,
then Han Sen was eligible to keep half of the proposed vials of
Angel Gene Fluid.</p>
<p>With great worry, they continued their ascent to the peak. All
the while, the thunder became worse and worse. Suddenly a bolt of
lightning struck a rock that was only a few meters away from Han
Sen.</p>
<p>But the rock seemed indestructible, and it had not been harmed
by the lightning. It was still perfectly smooth, and not a single
blemish had been brought to it.</p>
<p>As they went higher, the frequency of the lightning increased.
After another hour’s travel, one bolt struck a man called Feng Lin.
He was struck while on his mount, and he was almost killed
outright. Heavily injured, the hair of his head had mostly been
burnt away. He was shocked.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the strike wasn’t too strong, and the man managed
to stand up after it occurred, much to the surprise of
everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone took extra care after that, summoning shields and
protective armaments for defense against any more renegade bolts of
lightning that sought to strike them.</p>
<p>It was fortunate they did this, as well, due to the increased
frequency of thunder and lightning. As they ascended, everyone
suffered at least one lightning strike. Others were unfortunate
enough to receive more than one.</p>
<p>Only Han Sen and his companions did not get shocked, despite how
large of a target the Golden Growler was. Strangely, the lightning
ignored them for the duration of their travel.</p>
<p>Han Sen acknowledged this was the work of the silver fox. Little
Silver, the thunder master, could bend the will of lightning to
avoid itself and its companions.</p>
<p>Han Sen hugged the silver fox and quietly said, “Little Silver,
could you draw more of the lightning over to them?”</p>
<p>The silver fox looked at Han Sen and tilted its head, signifying
its understanding of Han Sen’s request. Then, a glint of evil
birthed in its eyes.</p>
<p>The silver fox jumped back away from Han Sen’s chest, returning
to Golden Growler’s head. It looked at the thunder streaking across
the sky.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A lightning bolt struck perfectly atop Lui Gui’s head. It
shattered his armor and knocked him from his ride. He convulsed on
the muddy ground, twitching in agony.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped to check on his wellbeing. Fortunately for
them, they had all unlocked their genes locks and were able to
withstand such hits.</p>
<p>“Manager Zhao, the frequency of lightning increases as we
ascend. It is likely we will all be injured before we reach the
top, and if the bull does reside there, our ability to fight will
be gone,” Lui Gui said.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin looked at the lightning in the sky, but he knew that
if they turned back now, they’d be handing over the Angel Gene
Fluid to Han Sen for free.</p>
<p>Then again, they could end up injured or even worse, if they
maintained their current course, just as Lui Gui said.</p>
<p>Zhao Xuebin gave his conundrum some thought but settled on
saying, "We are not far from the peak. If we get there and do not
find the bull, we will return immediately.</p>
<p>After he said that, everyone mounted their rides again and
continued up the treacherous slopes of the mountain.</p>
<p>Following this, more and more lightning continued to strike,
accurately hitting each of the Angel Gene members and injuring
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked ahead to the peak. He could not see anything
there yet, but he began to sense a powerful lifeforce stemming from
there. He knew something had to be up there, he was just unsure
whether or not it was the Thunderbull he had pledged to kill.</p>
<p>Regardless of what it was, however, Han Sen did not think the
others could make it.</p>
<p>The silver fox’s eyes flashed with silver, in a connection with
the lightning that streamed across the skies. Every time a new bolt
appeared, his eyes flashed silver and a scream would erupt from
behind.</p>
<p>“This is strange; why has the lightning not harmed you once?”
They were starting to suspect something was wrong, and after Lui
Gui was struck again, he couldn’t hold himself from confronting Han
Sen.</p>
