<p>“What is your name?” Han Sen looked at the babyfaced man.</p>
<p>“Luo Yin,” the babyfaced man answered quickly; he didn’t seem
cold or ireserved.</p>
<p>“Why have you gotten into a fight with the people from Angel
Gene?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Because I despise trouble.” Luo Yin shrugged.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “If you are afraid of getting into
trouble, you may have to study what is needed to avoid it. Hunting
down members of Angel Gene is not how you stay out of trouble.”</p>
<p>“I am not a smart person, so studying does not come easy.” Luo
Yin sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the man was rather interesting, but he had yet
to receive any concrete information from him. The guy was not just
funny, as there was a depth to his character. He was not as simple
as he was letting on.</p>
<p>“You really are Dollar?” Luo Yin asked.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“It is a shame I have sustained such wounds. If I was in better
condition, I would enjoy sparring with you,” Luo Yin said.</p>
<p>“You seem to have forgotten that you owe me one life.” Han Sen
looked at Luo Yin.</p>
<p>“I have not said anything to contradict my prior pledge. If we
fight, and I beat you, but at the same time do not kill you,
consider that a cash-in on the life I owe you,” Luo Yin said, with
surprising seriousness.</p>
<p>“And what if you lose?” Han Sen was really interested in Luo
Yin.</p>
<p>“You can either kill me or spare me. If you spare my life, I
will owe you two,” Luo Yin answered the question directly, and did
not even pause for a brief moment before responding.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head, and with a wry smile said, “What are you
doing here?”</p>
<p>“I have come here to fight someone I cannot kill,” Luo Yin
replied.</p>
<p>“You are an interesting fellow. If you cannot kill the person
you seek to fight, why bother fighting him at all? You expect and
accept loss?” Han Sen thought the person he had met was someone of
great depth, and his persona was colored and textured with many
layers of thoughtful contemplation.</p>
<p>“I do not like killing people. To fight someone and lose may not
be all that bad,” Luo Yin said.</p>
<p>“In that case, good luck.” Although Han Sen considered the man
with great interest, he did not want to engage in a pointless
conversation such as this. He wanted information, and he wouldn’t
get any if he carried on like this.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood up and prepared to leave. But Luo Yin, trembling,
stood up and looked to follow.</p>
<p>“Why are you following me?” Han Sen asked, as a queer tone
coated his words.</p>
<p>“I cannot leave something undone; I cannot leave a debt unpaid.
I will follow you until you prepare a task for me. Once I have
accomplished the deed you bid me to do, I will leave and pursue
whatever endeavor I seek next,” Luo Yin said.</p>
<p>“Although I would like to fulfill your pledged obligation, there
is no one here that can threaten me. It’ll be some time before you
can repay me.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“You are proud?” Luo Yin said, partly in question.</p>
<p>“I have what it takes to be proud, don’t I?” Han Sen coldly
said.</p>
<p>Luo Yin did not say anything further. Instead, he moved.
Although he was heavily injured, his strike was incredibly steady.
An invisible power departed his hands.</p>
<p>“Falsified-Sky power?” Upon seeing the power, Han Sen’s face
changed. He was no longer a stranger to this force.</p>
<p>Without hesitating, Han Sen threw a punch to collide with that
power. The power of the Elephant-Rex Strike put the very atmosphere
into a vortex of turmoil.</p>
<p>But just as Han Sen’s fist looked to touch the invisible power,
it disappeared right before the collision. Before Han Sen noticed
anything further, he was slashed across the chest. A sharp metal
noise was produced.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, not knowing how he was hit. He could
predict the Falsified-Sky power, but his punch did not come into
contact with it.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one surprised, however, as Luo Yin looked
visibly shocked, as well. Although he hit Han Sen with all his
might, it only left a light mark on his armor.</p>
<p>He was going to say, “I could have beheaded you, but I did not.
Consider the life I owe you repaid.”</p>
<p>But instead, there was only silence. He acknowledged his
inability to slay Dollar, and as a result, could not so easily
repay the life he owed.</p>
<p>“Try again,” Han Sen looked at Luo Yin and told him. He knew Luo
Yin was not mad, and he knew for sure the strike was not supposed
to kill him outright.</p>
<p>But he wanted to know why he could not block it. The man’s
Falsified-Sky power was different than what Luo Li had
exhibited.</p>
<p>“If you have heard of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, then you must
know you cannot withstand my power. It conjures a strike that
cannot miss, no matter how the sought-recipient seeks to dodge.”
Luo Yin felt awkward but continued to speak. “I cannot break your
armor, however. It is useless, even if I manage to hit you. You
were indeed correct, none can threaten you. Not here, not in the
Second God’s Sanctuary. I am afraid I will never be able to repay
you.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe that,” Han Sen frowned. Han Sen had never of
an attack such as the one he spoke of. He did not know because he
had not practiced the Falsified-Sky Sutra.</p>
<p>Luo Yin said nothing more and instead tried to attack again.</p>
<p>This time, Han Sen stared at his curious opponent with absolute
focus. He was going to give it his all and dodge the strike that
was to come, but it was useless. The attack hit his neck.</p>
<p>Luo Yin did this another thirteen times until he collapsed and
sat on the ground. His wounds were cracked once more, and blood
oozed from the orifices.</p>
<p>The thirteen hits were all delivered to different parts of Han
Sen’s body. He tried dodging and blocking each time, but despite
his most valiant efforts, he failed to avoid the hits. If he wasn’t
wearing his Devil-Ant King armor, he’d have been dismembered
thirteen times.</p>
<p>No matter how much he tried, Han Sen could not block the
attacks. Each of Luo Yin’s strikes were sent and received exactly
where he desired them to be. No matter how hard Han Sen tried, he
could not dodge them.</p>
<p>“No wonder Mom said, when I meet someone who has fully learned
the true Falsified-Sky Sutra I should not dodge or try to defend.
Killing such a foe quickly would be the only route to victory. It
really is quite the terrifying skill.” Han Sen’s heart was rocked
with surprise. He couldn’t even see where Luo Yin attacked from, so
it was no wonder why this skill of the Luo family was considered
legendary.</p>
<p>“Ah, I cannot kill you. You should go. If you need me to kill
someone on your behalf someday, call me anytime. This is getting
annoying.” Luo Yin sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Luo Yin and did not say anything. He turned
and left.</p>
<p>Although he knew Luo Yin could not beat him, the Falsified-Sky
Sutra’s power made Han Sen feel danger unlike ever before. For now,
Luo Yin could not break his armor, but what if someday someone
could? What if he went up against a foe possessing a weapon that
could perform the strike as needed?</p>
<p>Han Sen lacked confidence in his ability to stay alive against
the Falsified-Sky Sutra because they could not miss. If they
attacked, it would all be over.</p>
<p>“What is Falsified-Sky Sutra, exactly?” Han Sen did not believe
an unbreakable skill existed in this world. Everything had its
weakness, and Han Sen only had to find it.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen had used his dongxuan aura to scan Luo Yin’s
moves when they fought. He couldn’t track the skill’s delivery, but
he did uncover something.</p>
