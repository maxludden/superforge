<p>“Everything is born a-laya, it’s already here, it is full and
clear; the same as nirvana.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t receive any new icy powers after unlocking his
first gene lock, but the strength of his body was dramatically
increased. That wasn’t the most important boon he had received,
however.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Han Sen’s seventh sense had received massive
amplifications. It had reached the max proficiency a human could
achieve, which gave Han Sen a curious feeling.</p>
<p>He couldn’t quite explain it, but it made Han Sen view the world
in a different way. He could see things as he had never seen them
before.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not tell what future changes this talent would
bring, but maybe it was because of his fitness that he didn’t
actually, fully unlock his gene lock. He felt as if he had unlocked
it, as much as he hadn’t. He couldn’t quite put a finger on
anything right now.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked out of the training room with his gene lock
opened. His heart felt strange, and as he walked, he felt as if the
walls around him were disintegrating. He was able to see
everything, beyond what any human eye could behold. But he also
felt as though his body was being encased in ice.</p>
<p>Sound, temperature, light; these things and more became simple
rules of additional deduction in his mind. So great was his vision
now, that even if he closed his eyes, he could still see what was
in front of him.</p>
<p>“This is too amazing. This feeling is too amazing!” Han Sen
wanted to be happy, but strangely, he was unable to feel any
particular emotion. It felt as if everything was pre-purposed and
almost expected, therefore nullifying the need to be explicitly
surprised or happy.</p>
<p>As Han Sen continued walking, he suddenly noticed a woman
removing her clothes; it was Annie. She had long legs, pale white
skin, and massive boobs – he could see it all.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen paid closer attention, he noticed there was a
wall separating them, and that Annie was actually in her changing
room. It was a thick wall like any other, but his vision provided a
clearer image than any thermal vision apparatus could.</p>
<p>In his current situation, however, Han Sen did not feel any
sensation of lust. Viewing Annie’s amazing body, he might as well
have been looking at a mannequin. He noticed her being as naked as
she was, but then turned and continued on his way.</p>
<p>He walked around the base and noticed a pain encroaching in his
head. He knew that his fitness level would have difficulty
supporting the unlocked gene lock. Therefore, to prevent further
pain, he exited gene lock mode.</p>
<p>His body reverted to its prior feelings of being “bound,” and he
lost the amazing feelings he had previously been drenched in. His
fitness returned to normal and his seventh sense reduced.</p>
<p>“Although it did not bear the fruit of elemental powers, I like
it. It’s not bad.” Han Sen finally smiled.</p>
<p>After turning off his gene lock, his emotions returned. He no
longer felt like one of the heartless monsters of the Xue family.
Now, he was back to his former, chirpy self.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of powers I would have received if I had
unlocked the gene lock with the Dongxuan Sutra? It would have been
greater than Jadeskin, that is for sure,” Han Sen predicted.</p>
<p>“Also, I wonder what my level is, compared to evolvers who have
already unlocked their gene lock?” Han Sen knew that Jadeskin
basically increased the current talents and abilities his body
possessed, with nothing extra. Therefore, he wasn’t sure how he’d
fare in a fight, going against those with elemental powers.</p>
<p>Returning to his room, Han Sen called Huangfu Pingqing. Soon
after, the communicator on the other end was picked up, and her
image filled the screen. Han Sen almost felt his nose start to
bleed.</p>
<p>Huangfu Pingqing was only wearing a very thin pajama gown, which
revealed a lot of skin. You could even see through the fabric, to a
certain degree. Although not everything was on display, what could
be seen was seductive and a little teasing.</p>
<p>“Little junior, why have you come looking for me? There must be
a reason for this call. I doubt you’re checking in to see how I
am.” Huangfu Pingqing seemed to deliberately lean forward,
presenting Han Sen with a full-screen image of the trench that
parted her perfect breasts.</p>
<p>“Senior, Queen told me that I should talk to you if I ever
needed to seek her out.” Han Sen’s lips may have been moving, but
his gaze had not. There would be no harm in such a stare, after
all.</p>
<p>Noticing his shameless gaze, Huangfu Pingqing felt a little
awkward. She widened her eyes to stare back at Han Sen and grabbed
a coat to veil her body. She then said, “Why are you looking for
Queen?”</p>
<p>“Senior, please tell her that after much deliberation, I have
decided to join her team,” Han Sen told her.</p>
<p>Now that he had successfully unlocked his gene lock, with his
fitness at the top, he didn’t need to worry about not being on par
with the others on Queen’s team. He was eager to see what sort of
super creature they would be hunting.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew it was extremely difficult for someone to hunt a
super creature by themselves, so cooperating with others was not
something he frowned upon.</p>
<p>By following Queen, he’d definitely have the opportunity to
witness the true powers that super creatures held. After all, the
silver fox was just a pup, and its strength must pale in comparison
to a fully-grown super creature.</p>
<p>“She invited you onto her team?” Huangfu Pingqing gave Han Sen a
look of surprise.</p>
<p>“Didn’t she tell you?” Han Sen looked at her strangely.</p>
<p>Queen told Han Sen to look for Huangfu Pingqing when he was
ready to join her team, so it was fair of him to assume that she
would know about the deal. Han Sen was surprised to learn that she
wasn’t aware.</p>
<p>“A person like her doesn’t talk to me that much,” Huangfu
Pingqing said. Then, after a brief pause, she continued, “But she’s
a proud woman; why would she value having a commoner such as you on
her team? I remember a few evolvers requesting spots on her team a
while back, and they had unlocked gene locks and everything, but
they were turned down. Why would she turn down those evolvers but
instead personally request your position on the team? I almost find
it difficult to believe. You must be quite the charmer.”</p>
<p>“I’m nothing special. I’m not the president yet; I still have a
long road to traverse before I reach the top.” Han Sen wiggled his
nose as he spoke.</p>
<p>Huangfu Pingqing had already built an immunity to Han Sen’s
shameless self-admiration. “I will make sure to let her know,
leastways. But, as for when you’ll receive a response? I don’t
know. It all depends on her mood.”</p>
<p>“I thank you, regardless. When I have retired from the army,
remind me to buy you lunch sometime.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll hold you to that.” Huangfu Pingqing returned Han
Sen’s smile.</p>
<p>After their conversation concluded, Han Sen went to a testing
lobby. He wanted to see what sort of power he had reached, having
now unlocked his gene lock.</p>
<p>To do a complete test, Han Sen went to an exclusive testing
lobby at the army base; not the ordinary, virtual-community
one.</p>
<p>After he selected his desired strength for the test, he entered
the testing room. Inside, a half-human cyborg appeared in front of
him.</p>
<p>This droid, designed exclusively for combat-testing, was built
to resemble a human. It was actually composed of many other smaller
robots. After a certain amount of damage had been dealt to the
droid, it would shatter. But then, it could quickly rebuild
itself.</p>
