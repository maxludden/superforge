<h2>Shelter of the Mystery Island</h2>
<h3>Chapter 640</h3>

<p>Back at the royal shelter, Han Sen asked to see Yang Manli for a
report on recent happenings during his absence.</p>
<p>Because very few people owned high-class wings, Yang Manli was
off having a quick look at the Mystery Island. They hadn’t attacked
the royal shelter there yet, due to their lack of the necessary
strength.</p>
<p>There were many creatures flying down from that place, however,
which had resulted in a few casualties across the ice fields. But
fortunately, they had managed to kill a good number of the beasts
that had caused trouble for them.</p>
<p>Right now, the humans that were too weak to fight were under
curfew and prohibited from leaving the shelter. Elites who went out
to hunt had to do so in large parties, in fear of being attacked by
the rogue flying monsters.</p>
<p>As for the royal shelter on the Mystery Island, not much was
known. No one had dared to venture near it, so it was not known
what the spirit inside looked like.</p>
<p>Yang Manli and a few of her trusted allies were now near it, and
they watched many big flying creatures circle around the spirit
shelter. Following this latest reconnaissance, they decided to
return.</p>
<p>“Let’s discuss how we plan to deal with the royal shelter at a
later date; for now, you should rest.” Han Sen knew discussions
were pointless. With the weakened forces of the ice fields, and the
lack of evolvers that could fly, attacking the royal shelter would
be futile no matter how many conversations were held.</p>
<p>Although it was a bit of a waste, Han Sen could only bring the
silver fox there with him. The greatest chance of conquering the
place would be to fly up there by himself, fox in hand, venture to
the spirit hall, and kill the spirit residing there.</p>
<p>But that would still be a near-impossible task. If the spirit in
the royal shelter flew away, it’d still be around the ice fields
providing many resources.</p>
<p>“Boss, did you kill Chen Ran?” After everyone left, Zhu Ting
stayed and asked Han Sen with a low tone of voice and a droopy
face.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Han Sen did not admit it or deny it.</p>
<p>There was no point in denying it. Even if Chen Ran’s people had
not run off, there were still many people who knew he was coming
after Han Sen. The most likely conclusion of what transpired would
have still been the same.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not willing to admit it, no matter what people
thought. Besides, no one had seen Han Sen kill Chen Ran, and his
body had already been cremated.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting, with a conflicted expression, looked at Han Sen and
said, “Chen Ran was one of the few elders in the Chen family. He
was a scarily powerful evolver and evil of heart. His passing at
your hands would be a great shock to the Chen family. They won’t
dare trouble you here, in the safety of a shelter’s walls, but out
there? In the wild? You should be wary.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t kill him. Even if I did, would they dare to kill a
member of the Alliance?” Han Sen was not afraid of the Chen
family.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a member of the Special Security Operations Team and
had since become leader of the ice fields. No matter how powerful
the Chen family was, killing Han Sen was impossible.</p>
<p>“It may be difficult for them to deal with you, on a surface
level, but you know them. There is much strife between members of
the Chen family. While others are partial to doing it, many do not
wish to offend the Jin and Qin families.” After a brief pause, Zhu
Ting continued, saying, “But Chen Ran had a real brother. He is a
surpasser, and a powerful figure of the Chen family. He is the sort
who is keen on the prospect of revenge. If he can’t kill you
publicly, there are many other ways he could go about it.”</p>
<p>“Give me an example,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure of any method he might try, but I just want you to
be careful, that’s all.” Zhu Ting shook his head.</p>
<p>“You are from the Chen family; are you not afraid or upset that
I killed Chen Ran?” Han Sen gave Zhu Ting a strange look.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting wore a wry smile, and he said, “I am nobody to them. I
am just a faceless bastard to a family who has plenty of children
and grandchildren of their own to take care of. A bastard can never
be treated on the same level. Do you know why I had to learn Deadly
Perfume?”</p>
<p>Han Sen watched Zhu Ting intently, allowing him to explain.</p>
<p>“The Chen family owned a country during a certain planet’s era.
It was ruled as a monarchy. Since time immemorial, kings have been
subject to many assassination attempts. Many are killed by poison;
that is why there are designated food testers. They taste the food,
to confirm there are no poisons within. Deadly Perfume was taught
to the people who performed that task. If what they consumed
contained poison, their body would release a perfume. If the poison
wasn’t too strong, the tester could live due to the teachings of
Deadly Perfume. If the poison was too much for the defense provided
by Deadly Perfume, the tester would end up dead.”</p>
<p>“Deadly Perfume is quite powerful; few poisons can breach its
protection. Isn’t that right?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting shook his head and said, “Poisons used to kill kings
are never so simple. The reason Deadly Perfume was so powerful is
because of how often these incidents occurred. Every time a new
poison was discovered, Deadly Perfume would be altered and improved
to defend against it. Across the countless generations Deadly
Perfume has existed, heaven knows how many deaths were sustained to
bring it to where it is today.”</p>
<p>“Only the servants of the Chen family can learn Deadly Perfume,
where only real members of the Chen family can learn the exclusive
Qi Gong Seven Twists. Do you still think I am considered a
Chen?”</p>
<p>Zhu Ting sighed and proceeded to say, “Chen Jiu Ling commanded
me to find a way in which I might kill you. But I know there is no
way for me to do that. I cannot return with my mission incomplete
and so, I will never return to the Chen family. I can only remain
hidden in this shelter, never again venturing beyond its
walls.”</p>
<p>“You stay here, then. As long as you are on the ice fields, and
even if members of the Chen family do show up, they won’t be able
to lay a finger on one hair on your head,” Han Sen sympathetically
said, secretly unsure whether or not this was a ploy of Zhu Ting.
Was he being truthful? Han Sen did not know. But having Zhu Ting on
his side was more useful than not. For now, he could continue
working for Han Sen, while being comforted at the same time.</p>
<p>After Zhu Ting left the room, Han Sen departed the shelter. He
found a place where there was no one around, summoned his wings,
and flew up towards the Mystery Island with the silver fox in
hand.</p>
<p>With the silver fox near, the flying creatures did not venture
close and his passage to the Mystery Island was unhindered.</p>
<p>This Mystery Island was far larger than the one he saw in the
First Shelter. You could see from afar a black metal shelter in the
middle of it, like some crouching goliath.</p>
<p>It was far smaller than the royal shelter that had belonged to
Princess Yinyang, and swathes of horrific beasts circled the skies
around it. He could tell this spirit shelter was far stronger than
the previous one he had striven to conquer.</p>
<p>But the creatures were merely set dressings to Han Sen, right
now. Holding the silver fox, Han Sen proceeded onwards as the
hordes of creatures parted to provide a path. Upon reaching the
front gate, he walked inside.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because this shelter was on a floating isle, but
every creature that populated this island had the ability to
fly.</p>
<p>There were giant birds, tigers with wings, creatures with four
wings, and even a giant snake that writhed its way across the
rooftops had a pair.</p>
