<h2>Elephant-Rex Strike</h2>
<h3>Chapter 671</h3>

<p>Six raven bolts launched consecutively into the frosty bear’s
face. The beast tried to look away, to avoid them piercing any of
its eyes, but it was too late. The bear had drawn too near to the
launch-point of the bolts, and it didn’t have sufficient time to
react. One of the bolts struck directly underneath the eye, which
caused it to bleed.</p>
<p>The frosty bear became incredibly angry. It threw itself back on
its two hind legs and a frigid aura emanated from its body. Its
paws came down, trying to strike Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the peacock crossbow away and evaded the frosty
bear’s lethal attack. He then jumped into the air, summoned Flaming
Rex Spike, and took aim at his foe’s head.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Fire and blood spewed everywhere as Han Sen crowned the bear’s
head with an ugly scorch mark.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Damage such as that was not enough to take the creature’s life,
but it did trigger its rage. Han Sen was at the center of its
attention now. It quickly lunged forward with its paws in an
attempt to grab Han Sen.</p>
<p>Again, Han Sen dodged. He evaded the bear, but it was close. He
scratched his arm and noticed the presence of a cut that was
bleeding through his armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen retreated, with frosty bear still gunning for him.</p>
<p>Luckily, this was Han Sen. And he did not fear the fatal, chilly
aura of the bear. If the roles were reversed, and Wang Yuhang was
on the run, he’d be dead right now.</p>
<p>“Big dumb bear, over here!” Wang Yuhang had already run a great
distance away. After his swift recovery, he noticed Han Sen was in
danger and so he did his best to provoke the bear.</p>
<p>This simple touting always worked in the past, and its
winning-streak did not end this day. Despite the hatred the bear
felt for Han Sen, it was once again attracted by Wang Yuhang. It
was as if Wang Yuhang had murdered its parents or something.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that if this were to continue, they’d be unable to
win the fight. The Flaming Rex Spike was strong enough to wreck the
bear’s body, but Han Sen wasn’t. His fitness was not high enough,
which meant he was unable to deal the deadly damage he needed to
bring an end to the bear.</p>
<p>But Han Sen knew what to do. Without saying a word, he rushed
after the frosty bear, and at the same time, he cast the Dongxuan
Sutra to simulate the energy of the bone elephant.</p>
<p>The overwhelming power of a super elephant now buffed Han Sen.
His body almost imploded under the duress of handling such supreme
power, as his muscles and bones struggled to maintain control.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang continued running forward. Li Xinglun continued
firing arrows to aid how he could, but they were useless against
the enraged beast. The frosty bear was closing in on Wang
Yuhang.</p>
<p>Han Sen was pushing his potential power to the max, and it was
reaching a tipping point. The bones inside him rattled and screamed
for reprieve. With the bear still focused on Wang Yuhang, Han Sen
leapt into the air with both of his hands clutching the Flaming Rex
Spike. He swung his weapon and all the terrifying power that
accumulated inside him was unleashed.</p>
<p>It was as if space time itself was dealt a blow by the attack,
and the air thundered with frightening sound.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The rex spike, blazing with fire, brought down a hideous,
devastating blow against the bear’s head. A deep, squelching thud
accompanied its landing as the skull of its target sunk somewhat.
The flames snapped in a dizzying crowd of embers as the fur of the
bear’s head turned to soot.</p>
<p>After that hit, Han Sen immediately summoned his wings to fly up
to the sky. Most of his energy had been drained following the
strike. If the bear was not killed by that attack and immediately
retaliated, Han Sen wouldn’t have had the energy to dodge the
foe.</p>
<p>Han Sen observed the field of battle from above and noticed the
bear had stopped moving. Blood seeped from the wounds of its
caved-in skull as its body wobbled.</p>
<p>“Roar!” the frosty bear blasted, which shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Then the frosty bear ran off.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was brought much joy. He knew that his
Elephant-Rex Strike must have dealt an insane amount of damage to
the bear; otherwise, it wouldn’t have tried to run off.</p>
<p>“After it! We cannot lose it!” Han Sen called out from the air
as he took off in airborne pursuit.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body felt weak, though. He couldn’t attack the bear
again for a short while. It was lucky that the flying beast soul
did not draw from an individual’s strength. If it did, he wouldn’t
have been able to keep up with the fleeing creature.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang and Li Xinglun obeyed the command and also went
after it. They tried to cut-off and surround the escaping bear, but
their attempts failed. They did not have super beast soul weapons,
so they could not even deal damage to the bear’s pelt.</p>
<p>But the frosty bear’s brain must have been heavily damaged, as
its judgment and movement made little sense. It did not try to jump
into the sea for a quicker escape; instead, it ran off towards the
Icefield. It still had speed, but its movements were shaky.</p>
<p>“Strike the wound on its head!” Li Xinglun fired an arrow at the
wound created by Han Sen’s Elephant-Rex Strike. This caused the
wound to gush out more blood, and the beast to cry out in pain.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang wanted to rush ahead, but he only had a single
ancient sword, and thus could not get close.</p>
<p>The frosty bear was managing to pick up its pace, despite the
pain it was enduring. The three of them were in tight pursuit, but
they eventually lagged behind and felt themselves losing it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the damage dealt to the brain was severe, and it
wasn’t working well as a result. The bear did not change direction
once, maintaining its course the entire time. As a result, the trio
didn’t lose its tracks.</p>
<p>The frosty bear ran deeper and deeper into the Icefield.
Eventually, its speed did slow down despite its desire to run.</p>
<p>“Move! Move!” Li Xinglun rode a mount to catch up. He shouted at
people on the Icefield, telling them to move out of the way and not
intercept the fleeing bear, lest they get grievously injured.</p>
<p>Most people did avoid the bear, but one group didn’t. Instead,
they ran towards it, wanting a piece of the action.</p>
<p>“Pah! Why do we have to step aside? Whoever kills it, owns it;
plain and simple. I don’t see your name on the bear, so why can’t
we kill it, huh?” the man leading the group said.</p>
<p>Li Xinglun looked at the people and realized it was Qi Xiuwen’s
men from the Blackgod Army. Although they belonged to the Goddess
Shelter, the four armies were individual and Li Xinglun didn’t have
the authority to tell them to stand down.</p>
<p>After the people rushed towards the bear, others who were nearby
noticed the possibility of nabbing an easy kill, too. They also
sought to join the fray. But everyone thought Li Xinglun was only
hunting a sacred-blood creature—one that looked heavily damaged.
The possibility of earning an easy beast soul was all too
enticing.</p>
<p>It was too late for Han Sen to stop them, however. He watched
many people descend on the bear, to which the creature they were
pursuing had a wretched reaction. It summoned its frosty aura and
unleashed a hail of ice chips to pelt the fresh attackers, freezing
the majority of them.</p>
<p>The strongest of those who sought to join in were most likely of
a fitness level of about one hundred. They had not even unlocked
their gene locks, and as a result, they had no chance of
withstanding such an attack.</p>
<p>The bear then pummeled the ground, which lead to a cascade of
blood. A few people were crushed, and none of their bodies were
left complete. Severed limbs were strewn about, and organs were
left exposed. One person was crushed into mince meat.</p>
