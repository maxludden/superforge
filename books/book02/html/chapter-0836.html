<p>Han Sen and Ji Qing sat at a table face-to-face. Many people bid
passing greetings to her, indicating her familiarity and popularity
with the people there.</p>
<p>When Han Sen looked around, he noticed a battle stage. Two
people were currently atop it, in a friendly bout of black and
white boxing.</p>
<p>Ji Qing was very good at black and white boxing. It was
something that helped train your psychological fortitude, and it
wasn’t something won by outright strength alone.</p>
<p>For power in that game, your mind had to be strong. If it
wasn’t, you’d be carrying an unloaded gun.</p>
<p>Since Ji Qing was good at this, she brought Han Sen in the
desire of testing his mind.</p>
<p>“Sister Qing, it has been a while since you last visited. And
you brought a man with you; is he your new boyfriend? My, my, you
go through them quickly!” A stylish young man approached and seemed
to be quite close with her. He immediately sat down and spoke to
her casually.</p>
<p>“Tu Bin! Do not talk such rot. This is my brother-in-law, Han
Sen. You must have heard of him, yes? He is the big hero that
defeated the royal shura Yu Qielan. He is not like you.” When Ji
Qing said that, she conveyed a certain amount of seriousness, but
it was betrayed by lively eyes that suggested a smile.</p>
<p>Tu Bin was the son of a boss of a financial department
someplace. His style exuded the look of a young gangster, but it
was far from his true identity. He was rather famous in the realm
of black and white boxing, and he was only slightly inferior to Ji
Qing.</p>
<p>Tu Bin and Ji Qing’s relationship was not as close as one might
suspect, however. They had no personal conflict with each other,
but they frequently came here to spar and battle against each other
with a mutual respect.</p>
<p>They did not hate each other, but they fought frequently. They
never battled elsewhere, just here to help each other become better
at this specific sport. Beyond the confines of this area, they did
whatever two young friends might get up to.</p>
<p>“Ah, you are the big Hero Han I’ve heard about? My apologies.”
It was difficult to discern whether Tu Bin’s words were sincere or
possessed undertones of sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Yes, so, presuming you have no other business to take up with
me, I suggest you go elsewhere. Do not disturb me right now,” Ji
Qing plainly told Tu Bin.</p>
<p>“If you came here alone, I would most certainly remove myself
from your presence. But today, Hero Han has come. If I did not ask
him to practice with me, that would be a shameful missed
opportunity.” Tu Bin then turned to look at Han Sen and continued,
“Hero Han, would you like to provide me some tips?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I haven’t played this game in a long time,” Han Sen
casually said.</p>
<p>Tu Bin looked ready to say something, but he was interrupted by
sudden loud noises coming from beyond a doorway. It looked like
something was underway.</p>
<p>“What’s that ruckus all about?” Tu Bin asked, wanting to keep
talking to Han Sen. No one replied.</p>
<p>The people who came to this place were typically quite young.
Although Tu Bin had quite a background, there were a lot more
people with far greater histories behind them.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Ji Qing looked to where the noises came from, and
they noticed a lot of people had gathered to chant someone’s
name.</p>
<p>There were so many people, Han Sen wasn’t sure what was going
on. He activated his dongxuan aura in a bid to learn more.</p>
<p>What he saw surprised him. It was all started by one person, and
that person was Yi Dongmu. He had actually come to this place, and
he looked quite popular, too.</p>
<p>“This is not fair. Why are handsome men so popular everywhere?”
Han Sen’s heart felt betrayed. He was a hero, but no one really
seemed to recognize him. Yet Yi Dongmu was receiving all the
attention in the world.</p>
<p>These thoughts did not immediately leave Han Sen’s mind, either.
It didn’t feel right, so he touched his cheek and thought, “It’s
not right. I am handsome. I must look better than that Yi Dongmu,
but why am I not receiving his treatment? Do people just love a
miserable emo more than they do a genuinely beautiful man?”</p>
<p>As Han Sen contemplated all this, Ji Qing and Tu Bin stood up.
They too looked excited, seeing Yi Dongmu ascend the battle
stage.</p>
<p>“Little Qing, what are you looking at?” Han Sen asked Ji
Qing.</p>
<p>“I am looking at Yi Dongmu! Who else would I be looking at?” Ji
Qing said, as she started walking forward to take a seat closer to
the stage so she could watch Yi Dongmu perform.</p>
<p>“Is he that good a person to look at?” Han Sen was genuinely
confused.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was willing to admit Yi Dongmu was a little
handsome, others were keen to suggest Yi Dongmu might be more
handsome than he himself. And that was too much for Han Sen. Ji
Qing was a renowned lady of the Ji family, too; there was no way
she’d regress into another member of the Yi Dongmu fangirl horde,
was there?</p>
<p>Ji Qing opened her mouth but did not say anything. Tu Bin looked
annoyed by what Han Sen asked and said, “Hero Han, you may have
beat the shura and shone a light on the Alliance, but I do not
advocate or appreciate what you have just asked. Yi Dongmu is a god
to the people of this Martial Hall. He beats everyone in the
central galaxy and never, ever loses! You may be strong, but in
black and white boxing, I don’t think you stand a chance against Yi
Dongmu. Only someone like Dollar could do that.”</p>
<p>Ji Qing was going to say something, but he covered all the bases
for her and she agreed with every last word.</p>
<p>If the ordinary elites in the Martial Hall could not beat Han
Sen, there was little to gain. But if Han Sen went up against Yi
Dongmu and defeated him, his true strength would most certainly be
revealed. That would prove a thing or two to Ji Qing.</p>
<p>Naturally, however, Ji Qing did not believe Han Sen could defeat
Yi Dongmu. She only wanted to gauge his strength in comparison to
the others.</p>
<p>But Ji Qing squinted her eyes and smiled. She said, “Tu Bin, I
am not fond of what you just said. My brother-in-law can beat a
royal shura, so I’m sure he can beat Yi Dongmu.”</p>
<p>Ji Qing did not say this in earnest. In her heart, she said to
herself, “I am sorry Yi Dongmu, I have no choice. I do support you,
but if I am to get Han Sen to reveal his true strength, he must go
up against you.”</p>
<p>When Tu Bin heard this, he became infuriated. Yi Dongmu was not
only his friend, but a god to the place.</p>
<p>Tu Bin merely stood up, clapped his hands, and shouted, “Quiet!
Everyone quiet!”</p>
<p>Everyone looked in his direction, unsure of what was happening.
Someone who was friendly with Tu Bin interrupted the sudden silence
and asked, “Tu Bin? Tu Bin, what the hell?”</p>
<p>Tu Bin then jumped on top of a chair. He pointed his finger at
Ji Qing and said, “Our Ji family lady, Ji Qing, just said her
brother-in-law, this Han Sen—the big Hero Han who beat the royal
shura Yu Qielan—could beat our Yi God in black and white
boxing.”</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
<p>Boo noises erupted all across the room, with not a single speck
of support for Han Sen.</p>
