<h2>The Raven’s Treasure</h2>

<p>“Are you okay?” The Queen looked at the wound on Han Sen’s back
in fright.</p>
<p>From shoulder to waist, his back had been sliced entirely open.
The gash was so deep, his spine was visible.</p>
<p>On Han Sen’s neck, there was another wound that oozed blood.
Fortunately for him, it wasn’t so deep as to touch the bone or
windpipe. If the raven had been allowed to go any deeper, he’d most
likely have been decapitated.</p>
<p>The wounds were scary to look at, but the blood loss wasn’t too
severe. Han Sen’sJadeskin allowed him to control his body, whereas
his Heresy Mantra allowed him to control his blood flow. If it
weren’t for those talents, he’d most likely have bled out and
died.</p>
<p>“I can hold it,” Han Sen hissed from his gritted teeth. His back
was in agony, and he knew he had a damaged spine. But fortunately,
it wasn’t too bad. If he had been a second slower with his jump,
his spine would have been shredded and nothing could have saved his
life.</p>
<p>The Queen retrieved some medicine from her satchel and applied
it to his wounds, which made Han Sen cry out in pain.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, a screech pierced the air. The black
raven, tangled and restrained by the vines, didn’t look so fearsome
as it once did. The ends of the vines were spiked, and they drove
themselves deep into the raven’s body. The vines seemed alive, as
if they had a thirst for the raven’s blood. As they absorbed the
scarlet, the vines themselves turned a deep shade of red.</p>
<p>The dried-up vines writhed with renewed vigor, and they started
to grow longer and larger than before.</p>
<p>Caw! Caw!</p>
<p>The black raven called out twice. Its body contorted and twisted
as plumes of feathers puffed out to dress the air like snowfall.
With great strength, the raven squirmed its way free from the
clutch of the vines and took off into the air in fear. It was gone
for good.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze when he saw that. He did not expect the raven to
be strong enough to escape the grasp of the vines.</p>
<p>After the raven escaped, the gourd vines retreated, wrapping
their way around the bones just as they were earlier. The vines
that had turned red now became yellow like before, as well.
However, many of them started to sprout green leaves.</p>
<p>The gourd in Han Sen’s hand continued to pulsate, but this
sensation did not disappear like it had before. Han Sen held onto
it, unsure whether or not life existed inside it.</p>
<p>If it contained something like the blood crystal wasps, Han Sen
would rather discard it right now. But because he was unsure, he
wasn’t willing to let go of some potential treasure just yet.</p>
<p>Aside from the strange beating pulse, nothing in particular
stood out. As he fingered it, his eyes drifted to the raven’s
feathers that now carpeted the ground.</p>
<p>The black feathers of the raven were of its outer-coat. It
wasn’t a great number that had fallen, but there were around
thirty. Each feather was about one foot long. He reached to grab
one and his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>The black feathers belonged to a super creature and did not look
normal. Rather than enabling flight, they were more like weapons
the raven could employ.</p>
<p>Every feather was like steel, and it was frightening to simply
hold.</p>
<p>“This cannot be the treasure the raven dropped.” Han Sen told
the Queen to gather up all the black feathers for him.</p>
<p>After an accurate count, there were thirty-six feathers. It was
a number that could be evenly split. With each feather being the
same size, Han Sen considered the possibility of crafting a fan
with them.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s back was in terrible pain. He looked at the Queen and
said, “How about you try out the sturdiness of the feathers?”</p>
<p>The Queen nodded. She drew her sacred-blood beast soul sword and
chopped one of the feathers with a direct hit. Nothing. Not a
single scratch was left upon it.</p>
<p>“This really is some good stuff!” Han Sen looked happy. If he
managed to modify the feathers a certain way, he’d be able to craft
a new type of bolt. If he used them alongside his peacock crossbow,
he might be able to slay a super creature with them.</p>
<p>“How about we split them up evenly? Eighteen feathers each,” Han
Sen suggested to the Queen.</p>
<p>“It is useless for me to own a bunch of silly feathers. You can
have them all.” The Queen passed all of the feathers to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Queen took notice of the strange crossbow Han Sen
had used to fire at the red-cloud donkey. Strangely enough, it
looked quite similar to the Deadeye Peacock. The Queen was starting
to wonder if the crossbow was the peacock’s beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen was certainly not going to admit anything on such a
subject, so the Queen didn’t ask. If Han Sen wanted those feathers,
it’d be to make bolts. Such bolts and a crossbow would come in
handy for the slaying of super creatures, so she preferred not
saying anything and simply giving all of the feathers to Han Sen
outright.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave the Queen a strange look as he accepted all the
feathers.</p>
<p>He believed from the way the Queen looked back at him that she
knew there was something up with his new crossbow. Yet she hadn’t
said a word about it. Her giving him all the feathers just made him
confused.</p>
<p>“We have to leave while the raven is gone. If the donkey
returns, our escape will be difficult with you unable to run due to
your injury.” After the Queen said this, she picked Han Sen up and
supported him in his descent down the rest of the mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen was being carried on the Queen’s back. He felt
incredibly privileged and cared for, for this was the first time
anyone else had helped him in such a way. The fact that it was a
woman made him feel odd, however.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, no more dangers arose during their time on the
road. They managed to descend the mountain without interruptions.
The Queen summoned an elephant ride and took Han Sen to the nearest
shelter so he could return to the Alliance and recover. His wounds
were incredibly grievous, and healing would not come quick or easy
with only medicine.</p>
<p>But he didn’t return to the Alliance, in the end. He had the
silver fox, and it was better than any potion or remedy the
Alliance could provide. Therefore, there was no reason to
return.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued thinking about the gourd, as well. He did not
want to return to the Alliance yet, because he did not want to
leave the gourd unattended.</p>
<p>He went straight to the silver fox and it immediately approached
Han Sen to lick his wounds. It was as strange as ever, to watch the
wounds seal up with each passing lick. Even the damaged bones
straightened, their gashes filling in.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s wounds recovering, the Queen booked another room
so they could live there temporarily. After leaving his room, Han
Sen pulled out the gourd and presented it to the silver fox, so he
might determine if it was good or bad.</p>
<p>Examining the gourd, the silver fox looked upon it strangely. It
continued to observe the gourd closely, circling it and sniffing it
every way it could.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the gourd for a while, as well. But soon
after, the silver fox just turned around and went to sleep on the
carpet.</p>
<p>“Hey, you better tell me what this thing is.” From the silver
fox’s behavior, he could not tell whether the gourd was a good
thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>But the silver fox just remained sleeping on the carpet,
ignoring the commands of his master. Han Sen knew the silver fox
wasn’t human, and it would not understand the complex lexicon of
the human language, so he stopped talking.</p>
