<h2>Solo Assassin</h2>
<h3>Chapter 550</h3>

<p>Yang Manli was unnerved. The forces of the Blackgod Shelter were
mighty, with seven elites with over 100 sacred geno points. Not to
mention their reserves of an additional 200 troops that were
branded as powerful evolvers, as well. The combined forces that had
set out to attack them were much too strong for the Goddess Shelter
to repel.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was going to concede, Yang Manli didn’t know what to
do; she’d be uncomfortable, and most likely upset, too.</p>
<p>Uncle Qing had a puzzled expression, as he watched Han Sen
venture towards the enemy, all alone. He looked to be deep in
thought.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting took a step backward. If things went badly, he was
ready to run.</p>
<p>Zhu Ting thought to himself, “Han Sen, this isn’t about me being
disloyal. It’s just that the enemy is too strong, and if I do run,
it’s so I can live to fight another day. It would be to reclaim
this place in the future.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was now standing a mere ten meters from Blackgod. He
looked at him and said, “Blackgod, how dare you show yourself to my
shelter? Have you forgotten how brutally beaten you were, following
our last duel?”</p>
<p>“To lose is no shame, but only the truest of victors gets the
last laugh; and that will be me!” Blackgod sneered. “I admit that
you possess great individual power, but this is no longer a duel.
If you surrender now, I will spare your life. If you refuse to
concede, then take one last look at those in your command. They, as
well as you, will be slain.”</p>
<p>“I assume you are relying on the strength provided by these
people behind you, those that are in your service.” Han Sen gave
the evolvers that were lined up behind Blackgod another look.</p>
<p>“Yes. I have six evolvers that have over 100 sacred geno points
and 237 evolvers that have more 60 sacred geno points. Destroying
your shelter will be easy,” Blackgod said with disdain.</p>
<p>Murmurs of concern could be heard from the Goddess Shelter. At
first, only Uncle Qing, Yang Manli and Zhu Ting could understand
the strength and power that Blackgod commanded before their gates;
but hearing what Blackgod had said, the rest of the populace was
beginning to understand, too. To know that there were six evolvers
with over 100 sacred geno points and 237 evolvers with over 60
sacred geno points were preparing to descend upon them made the
people rightly fearful.</p>
<p>In the Goddess Shelter, there were only about ten people with a
fitness level above 60. Han Sen was the sole figure known to be
over 100.</p>
<p>But now, their opponents had seven with over 100. The power gulf
was too large to bridge.</p>
<p>“That means we have to fight today then, does it not?” Han Sen’s
face remained impassive, as he waited for Blackgod to speak.</p>
<p>“Kneel to me, plead before me for forgiveness over your sins and
transgressions and then give me your shelter. Do this, and I will
spare your life.” Blackgod’s mouth curled in a sneer as he looked
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>He was not willing to settle for the death of Han Sen today - he
was determined to take ownership of the shelter. If he could force
Han Sen concede, then he would not have to expend resources in
claiming another shelter.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed, and then said, “That’s a shame.”</p>
<p>Coldly, Blackgod said, “And what is a shame, exactly?”</p>
<p>“Soon, you will find out that which you rely on is puny and
ridiculous. It’s a shame you won’t be given the opportunity to
laugh anymore.” As Han Sen said this, his legs spurred up with the
strength of triumphant stallion. He galloped towards Blackgod.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy?!” the people screamed in the Goddess Shelter. No
one had expected Han Sen to charge at the Blackgod army all by
himself.</p>
<p>There were seven evolvers with over 100 sacred geno points, and
over 200 elite evolvers that had over 60 sacred geno points. If
Blackgod’s army was a formation of hefty rocks, the Goddess Shelter
was a basket of eggs. For Han Sen to rush into the enemy looked
like a futile suicide mission.</p>
<p>“How dare you!” Blackgod shouted. He lifted his black longsword
to signal his six supreme evolvers to step forward, attempt to
block Han Sen’s coming, and to potentially surround him.</p>
<p>From what Blackgod was seeing, he too now assumed Han Sen to be
a suicidal maniac. This was bizarre, because he personally knew how
powerful he was. Still, such power paled in comparison to that of a
whole army.</p>
<p>No matter how strong someone was, in a battlefield that was
comparable to a meat grinder, Han Sen was just a single soldier.
For a confrontation such as this, Blackgod believed it would all
hinge on how a commander led his troops.</p>
<p>What Blackgod was doing now was using his army to crush Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen race towards the opposing forces alone, it wasn’t
just Blackgod who thought he was being suicidal – everybody else
was, too.</p>
<p>“Crazy… This man is crazy!”</p>
<p>“Wretched people meet a wretched fate; how unsurprising. Oh
well, nobody told him to behave this way.”</p>
<p>“We should open the gate while he is away and roll out the red
carpet, give Blackgod a proper welcome. You know, just in case they
decide to kill us after they’re done using Han Sen as a chew
toy.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Get that gate open. Let’s welcome them in!”</p>
<p>A few commoners went out towards the gate and attempted to open
it.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill whoever gets close to this gate, you hear me!?” Yang
Manli stared down those who had ventured forward, while bellowing
at them.</p>
<p>The Goddess army that was guarding the gate then turned around
to raise their weapons at any would-be meddlers. Seeing them
receive such a hostile reaction, the commoners became afraid, and
stopped their approach.</p>
<p>“Vice-Leader Yang! Han Sen is rushing out and welcoming his
demise with open arms. There is no reason for you to die alongside
him. We seek to open this gate for the benefit of everyone.”</p>
<p>"Yes, Han Sen may not want to live, but we do!</p>
<p>“He is like an egg playing conkers with a stone. Oh, Vice-Leader
Yang, you are so pretty. Do not squander your beauty like
this.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Although they did not dare to march any closer to the gate, they
were still willing to argue with Yang Manli.</p>
<p>“Instead of being this worried now, you should be more concerned
about what will happen when we beat Blackgod,” Yang Manli stated
coldly.</p>
<p>The commoners all felt a chill run down their spine, but one
person dared to speak out in continued defiance. “Yang Vice-Leader,
perhaps you are too hopeful. The Blackgod army is too strong, and
Han Sen is going to get himself killed. And now you think you can
repel the march of their army? You are daydreaming!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, you’re just day-dreaming!” Many others agreed,
most of them being those who had quit the Goddess army.</p>
<p>Outside the gate, out on the battlefield, Han Sen was racing
into the enemy’s army. His hands were empty, having not summoned a
single weapon. He did not even wear armor, either. He might as well
have been naked.</p>
<p>The six evolvers instantly launched forwards to fight Han Sen.
They wielded beast soul weaponry, and unleashed their evil powers
as they leapt towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was incredibly fast. And even at the high-speed he
was going, he could take sharp turns without slowing down. He
avoided two attacks that came towards him by quickly dodging left
and right, then pushed on towards Blackgod.</p>
<p>The four evolvers were alarmed at Han Sen’s advance, and
attempted to cut him down before he could come any closer.</p>
<p>But Han Sen possessed the agility of a bird, and to move as he
did, while maintaining his furious speed, was almost like magic.
Within a second, he had got past the four that had attempted to
stop him.</p>
<p>He was unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>And he was unbelievably strong.</p>
<p>Not one of the six evolvers had managed to stop Han Sen. And
now, this solo assassin had nothing to stop him. Once he passed the
six evolvers, Han Sen advanced towards Blackgod.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Blackgod was shocked. It hadn’t been that long
since their last match together, but his powers had increased
immeasurably. With a speed like this, heaven knows how much better
he was now.</p>
