<p>“Brother Han, you have treated me like a little brother. If you
are willing to help me, I will treat you with the reverence of a
real brother.” Qi Xiuwen looked at Han Sen when he spoke.</p>
<p>“If I said I was willing to help you, would you honestly believe
I would?” Han Sen responded, looking calmly back at Qi Xiuwen.</p>
<p>“I see no reason why I would not believe you. But, I do have
medicine with me. It is my hope that you will take it.” Qi Xiuwen
had no fear of anything. He pulled out a platinum bottle from his
inner-chest pocket and threw it towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen caught the bottle and opened it. It contained numerous
fire crystal-looking pills that were about the same size as a
pigeon’s eye.</p>
<p>“What are these pills?” Han Sen held one of the pills in his
hand and looked at it in the light. He noticed the hardened
exterior of the pill contained a rolling liquid inside.</p>
<p>“It’s a Geno Creation pill. Our Dong Lin contains fantastic
biological gene technology. This is just one of our products. Once
you eat it, it can trigger geno mutations. There’s every chance it
could make you stronger, but…” Qi Xiuwen gave a brief pause. After
a while, he resumed by saying, “But there is also the chance your
genes suffer a snafu of sorts. But don’t you worry! If you inject
yourself with a geno stabilizer, you can stabilize the mutant
genes. It won’t harm your body. This isn’t some fresh product that
has just come out the oven; it’s mature and has been
extensively-developed. Nothing will go wrong.”</p>
<p>“If I take this, then that would mean I would have to listen to
you for the rest of my life.” Han Sen spoke with a frosty tone as
he looked at the Geno Creation pill.</p>
<p>“I must confess, I wouldn’t let a character such as yourself out
of my sight for very long. If I let you leave, my thoughts and
dreams would be disturbed! That is why I must put you on a leash as
soon as I am able,” Qi Xiuwen said.</p>
<p>“You have more than forty evolvers with a fitness level of over
one hundred, and you have an elite who has unlocked their first
gene lock. It looks like you have exerted a lot of effort in
composing this little posse of yours.” Han Sen looked around the
room, observing the faces of all who were present.</p>
<p>“Brother Han is a very powerful person. Such preparations were
necessary. If I wasn’t going to stake a claim and take this royal
shelter for myself, I wouldn’t have bothered Thunderdevil to come
all this way.” Qi Xiuwen smiled.</p>
<p>“You really think that special little elite in your midst is
invincible?” Han Sen went back to stroking his silver fox. He then
raised his lips in a disdainful smile.</p>
<p>“Did you just say ‘special little elite’?! You better watch your
tone, boy.” Thunderdevil’s face now changed as he glared fiercely
at Han Sen, green electricity crackling all around his body.</p>
<p>When everyone saw the electricity that swirled, snapped, and
crackled around Thunderdevil, their hope for a happy ending
vanished. This really was an elite who had unlocked their first
gene lock, and he was no foe to be trifled with.</p>
<p>“Mister Qi, there is no need to entertain this tiring chit-chat
with the boy. If he does not quickly agree, then just kill him.”
Thunderdevil maintained his gaze on Han Sen while he spoke to Qi
Xiuwen.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, please consider it.” Qi Xiuwen was getting
annoyed.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem? I was being honest. An elite who has
unlocked their first gene lock? Am I supposed to be afraid or
something? You’re pulling my leg, right? Did you think this clown
would frighten me?” Han Sen said, with a frost-bitten tone.</p>
<p>After Han Sen said this, everyone’s faces warped into looks of
disbelief. No one believed Han Sen would have the audacity to say
something like that. To show contempt towards an elite of such a
high rank was near-enough to asking for death.</p>
<p>To call the elite a clown, Han Sen must have lost his mind.</p>
<p>“Do you have a death wish, boy?” Electricity now swirled madly
around Thunderdevil, and green bolts of lightning cracked in his
eyes. Han Sen’s disrespect seemed to have made him extremely
angry.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen had not given the order to attack yet, so Thunderdevil
stayed put.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, if you continue to be so stubborn, then don’t
blame me for what happens next.” Qi Xiuwen’s face looked bleak. He
turned to look at Thunderdevil, then nodded.</p>
<p>Thunderdevil had already come to dislike Han Sen. He was not
accustomed to being looked down upon by someone who had not yet
unlocked their own first gene lock. He thought Han Sen didn’t know
his place.</p>
<p>The moment Qi Xiuwen nodded, fierce shieldings of electricity
surrounded Thunderdevil. He was wholly consumed by the green aura
of airborne fire. His hands clutched a long physical bolt of
lightning, and threw it like a javelin towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>With the terrifying scene that was now unfolding, everyone took
a step back to avoid being struck by Thunderdevil’s thunder and
lightning. He was so bright, they could not even see Thunderdevil’s
body.</p>
<p>All that could be heard was the swirling pressure of crackling
static and electricity. Han Sen then saw the incoming spear of
lightning.</p>
<p>This scary power made everyone’s hearts pound in fear, but it
also gave them each a modicum of jealousy, wishing they could one
day attain such talent. All of them desired to one day unlock their
first gene lock, but realistically, only one in a million was
likely to achieve such a status.</p>
<p>But between their jealousy and frightened emotional state, they
thought they were going to have to watch Han Sen be slain by the
Thunderdevil. However, it was at that moment that the silver fox
Han Sen had been holding leapt into action.</p>
<p>A silver cloud of lightning appeared and annihilated the
incoming spear of green electricity. Then, more thunder snapped the
skies apart. Before it could finish, it was joined by a chorus of
screams.</p>
<p>The Thunderdevil, who once struck fear into the hearts of
everyone present, was now blackened and charred. Then he fell to
the floor. There were three gouge-marks in his body, wounds that
were deep enough to reveal his bones. He writhed around on the
floor, unable to stand back up.</p>
<p>The audience quaked in their boots, in utter disbelief at the
sight of Thunderdevil squirming around on the ground. When the
screaming stopped, the Spirit Hall fell silent. Not even the sounds
of breathing could be heard from the crowd that watched.</p>
<p>“No way. How?!”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“How can an elite who has unlocked their first gene lock be
beaten by a little pet fox?!”</p>
<p>Everyone was speechless, and their minds were now plagued with a
thousand different questions over what they had just witnessed. All
they could do was look at Thunderdevil, who was rolling around on
the floor.</p>
<p>The color in Qi Xiuwen’s face drained, and a chill spiked his
heart. He could not believe his ace-in-the-hole had been beaten so
simply. He was an elite who had unlocked his first gene lock, after
all.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the silver fox and stroked him in his arms
once more. Then he walked up to the ground-bound Thunderdevil and
kicked him in front of Qi Xiuwen.</p>
<p>“Did I say clown? I’m sorry; this guy is an insult to clowns. Is
this who you were relying on?” Han Sen looked at Qi Xiuwen, who now
bore a pale face.</p>
<p>Thunderdevil, who was near Qi Xiuwen’s feet, was spilling blood
from his mouth. It looked as if he was on death’s door.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen and his forty other elites looked absolutely
petrified. They did not dare to move. The teeth of the audience
were chattering, and their bodies were shivering in fear and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen must have thought he was suffering an unrelenting
nightmare. He had more than forty elites, one of which had unlocked
his first gene lock. This powerful line-up, that had seemed to
dwarf the rest in the hall, now seemed like a pitiful joke.</p>
<p>Yes, it was ridiculous. Qi Xiuwen had believed he controlled the
crushing power necessary to subdue any foe that sought to hinder
his goals and desires. Now, he believed it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>This man, who listened to everything and never said no, Qi
Xiuwen had thought to be stupid. But now, he revered Han Sen like
some god. He could hardly look at him, and all he could do was
shiver in his boots.</p>
<p>It was in this moment that Qi Xiuwen realized Han Sen never once
took him seriously, and that the entire time he had been with him,
he must have been merely enjoying the comedy. It was as if he had
been watching an ant, being arrogant and trying to bully others.
His behavior had been ridiculous and all his plans were
childish.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Qi Xiuwen’s confidence collapsed and with it,
he fell to the ground.</p>
