<p>“Mister Han, I have admired your name for a long time. Today, I
finally get to meet you!” In the Blackgod Shelter, a young man
shook Han Sen’s hand with awe-driven sincerity.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and looked at Qi Xiuwen, a person who was young,
handsome, and most certainly outgoing. He had a smile that could
melt the collective hearts of the entire world.</p>
<p>But in Qi Xiuwen’s features, Han Sen could spy the shadow of
Ning Yue. Still, Qi Xiuwen was much younger.</p>
<p>Ning Yue’s heart and mind operated in tandem, neither feeling
differently from the other. Inner-disputes concerning morals and
other such things stem from the differences of ideals and favoring
of people’s hearts and minds, but it wasn’t so with him. Qi Xiuwen
was no different than the norm, in this regard.</p>
<p>In Han Sen’s eyes, Qi Xiuwen was a little girl in his mother’s
clothing, applying too much make-up and trembling in her
high-heels. He was clearly attempting to come across as mature.</p>
<p>Even though his appearance left much to be desired, he meant
well. Perhaps he would make a name for himself in the future, but
for now, he was clearly too young.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to observe Qi Xiuwen. He nodded but didn’t
care much for him and didn’t consider him a threat or potential
opponent. His opponent wasn’t even in the general vicinity of
Blackgod Shelter; he wasn’t anywhere across the ice fields, either.
From Han Sen’s point of view, this was a small place and to keep it
running against all odds wasn’t really worth it.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Han, I must have you take care of me in the future.
I have only just arrived in the shelter, so could you provide me
with some mutant flesh and beast souls? It would be most favorable
if they were of the sacred-blood variety, too!” Qi Xiuwen presented
himself as lowly, like an absolute newbie.</p>
<p>“Sure, no problem,” Han Sen agreed.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen was made immeasurably happy, and said in appreciation,
“Then I will be sure to rely on you in the future! Father told me
there is much I should learn from you. If it is okay with you,
could you bring me along next time you go out to hunt
creatures?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Han Sen agreed.</p>
<p>Han Sen made Yang Manli sell the flesh and beast souls that Qi
Xiuwen desired to him. If he was willing to pay, there was no
reason for his request to be rejected.</p>
<p>“Mister Qi, why are you being so polite to Han Sen? The Blackgod
Shelter and its people are ours. Say the word, and we will have him
thrown out.” An evolver spoke to Qi Xiuwen slyly, once Han Sen had
departed.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen quietly said, “Things aren’t what they may seem to
you. Han Sen really is quite something and kicking him out would
not solve the problem. Attend to your own responsibilities and do
not go against him. I will be around him for the time being,
discussing various matters.”</p>
<p>“Why?” A few evolvers looked at Qi Xiuwen with befuddled
expressions.</p>
<p>“If you want to beat someone, it’s easier when you get close to
them,” Qi Xiuwen calmly said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yang Manli was very confused. She expected a great deal of
things to change when Qi Xiuwen arrived at the Blackgod Shelter but
was surprised to find everything mostly the same. Everyone
continued to listen to Han Sen’s orders and everything was business
as usual.</p>
<p>Qi Xiuwen, however, followed Han Sen around wherever he went
like his shadow. It was almost as if Han Sen had asserted himself
as his master, whereas Qi Xiuwen had accepted the role of a
servant. Or like they were teacher and student.</p>
<p>But Yang Manli thought something was amiss with Qi Xiuwen’s
behavior. Despite Qi Xiuwen’s apparent and continued respect for
Han Sen, Yang Manli couldn’t help but feel a little paranoid of
something sinister lurking beneath the newbie’s exterior.</p>
<p>“I think there is something wrong with that Qi Xiuwen. Please,
be careful and don’t get too close with him.” Yang Manli made sure
to remind Han Sen, whenever they had a moment to themselves.</p>
<p>“Understood,” Han Sen agreed, but he didn’t seem too concerned.
Whenever Qi Xiuwen asked him something, Han Sen continued to teach
and explain things.</p>
<p>Yang Manli made sure to remind Han Sen of her suspicions many
times, but Han Sen didn’t make a single change.</p>
<p>“I think we need to talk about the problem that is Qi Xiuwen.”
Yang Manli approached Han Sen, who was getting ready to go out on a
hunt. She made sure to block his passage.</p>
<p>“Fine. Speak.” Han Sen smiled, sat down, and looked at Yang
Manli.</p>
<p>“That Qi Xiuwen is dangerous. He is trying to please everyone
around you, but he is something else. He is a slithering snake.”
Yang Manli said her piece straight, hoping to talk some sense into
Han Sen and get him to pay attention.</p>
<p>“I know,” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“If you know, why do you still conform to everything he asks?”
Yang Manli looked him in the eye and said.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped to think for a second, then he tilted his head
and replied, “Manli, have you ever owned a pet?”</p>
<p>“I am talking about something serious here!” Yang Manli was
starting to sound annoyed.</p>
<p>“Why am I not being serious? I’m just wondering, have you ever
owned a pet?” Han Sen smiled and asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Yang Manli couldn’t be bothered, but still answered.</p>
<p>“I used to know a neighbor who owned a cat. It was a really big,
good-looking panther. It had thick black fur and the neighbor
really cherished it. He groomed the cat each and every day, fed it
luxurious cat food, and provided it with a magnificent cat
house.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and then continued, “Whenever I walked past his
house, I could look over and see the cat sunbathing in the yard
like some lord, behaving like the master of the house. Whenever it
was upset, it would chew up the shoes in the house and whenever the
master wasn’t paying attention to it, the panther would tear up the
books he was reading.”</p>
<p>Yang Manli’s face lit up, as if she had just realized something.
Then she started looking at Han Sen with wondering eyes, as if she
were in deep thought.</p>
<p>“I was curious. So, I went to ask the neighbor why he spoiled
the cat like that,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“And what answer did you receive?” Yang Manli curiously
asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed and said, “Well, the neighbor just rolled his
eyes and said, ‘Don’t you know it’s only a cat? Its world is fairly
small and as a master, I am its everything. In the reverse, from
your point of view, it is only a cat.’”</p>
<p>After he said that, Han Sen patted Yang Manli’s shoulder and
said, “You go do your thing. Our world does not belong here.”</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s shadow leave the room, Yang Manli’s emotions
were in complicated knots. A prevailing emotion, however, was one
of shock.</p>
<p>“So, after all, he does not value Qi Xiuwen. And he does not
prioritize the well-being of the ice fields or the Blackgod Shelter
in his heart?” Yang Manli’s eyes looked confused, and she continued
talking to herself. “To you, Qi Xiuwen is merely a fun pet.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen left the shelter, he boarded his Crystal Palace
and went off in search of more mutant creatures to hunt. The flesh
of the mutant creatures he had hunted previously had all been
eaten, which had raised his amount of mutant geno points to 76. It
was close to being maxed out.</p>
<p>Although there were many mutant creatures in the sea, eating
their flesh took a long time, due to the rareness of small mutant
creatures out there.</p>
<p>The silver fox perched upon Han Sen’s shoulder with a wagging
tail. It watched the fish outside the sea with eyes of fervent
wonderment.</p>
<p>“In the Crystal Palace, the silver fox’s presence doesn’t seem
to be noticed by the creatures of the sea. Perhaps this is my
chance,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
