<p>After seeing Han Sen enter a testing lobby, Annie was again
watching his every move. Quickly, she went to the observation room
so she could see how he was performing.</p>
<p>The test Han Sen was undertaking had been designed to accurately
measure the dexterity of his abilities. He had never taken this
test before, so Annie did not actually know what his proper level
was.</p>
<p>With Han Sen now taking this test, Annie wasn’t going to let
this opportunity for observation pass her by.</p>
<p>But due to the difficulty Han Sen had selected, Annie couldn’t
help but feel a little disappointed.</p>
<p>He had chosen a difficulty level of one hundred, which meant Han
Sen would only need a level of one hundred to beat it. Annie
already knew that his power was well above one hundred.</p>
<p>Since she was here, anyway, she stayed to watch how he
operated.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t chosen a stronger difficulty because he knew
about the prying eyes, and he knew anyone could be watching from
the observation room. He did not yet wish to reveal his true
strength.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s primary goal in the testing lobby was to flex and push
the boundaries of the new special senses he had received by
unlocking his gene lock. Therefore, he did not need to select a
harder difficulty, anyway.</p>
<p>Han Sen crushed the testing droid swiftly, and it quickly
rebuilt itself as two.</p>
<p>After Han Sen destroyed both robots again, they too duplicated.
When the four appeared before him, Han Sen quickly cut them down.
Then again when eight appeared. And in this way, he kept going.</p>
<p>Han Sen rapidly tore through the robots with ease.</p>
<p>After watching for a while longer, Annie’s face started to turn
heavy.</p>
<p>The difficulty Han Sen had selected may not have been high, but
the way he was slicing through the droids was special. She did not
notice it at first, but after watching for a while, her face
twisted.</p>
<p>These droids had the established behavior for duplicating on
defeat. This meant the more Han Sen killed, the more there would
be. And the more droids there were, the more attacks would come Han
Sen’s way. Unlike humans, they were systematic and did not have to
think; this also meant there was less room for error.</p>
<p>Such robots didn’t make mistakes, and their precision greatly
exceeded the capability and reliability of humans. Although these
attacks could not threaten Han Sen’s life, the way he cut down the
droids surprised Annie.</p>
<p>Han Sen, despite dodging and avoiding every single attack, did
not even turn around to look at the swings and slashes that were
coming his way. He could accurately destroy each droid from behind.
Even when many droids attempted to strike him at the same time, he
did not have to turn around to dodge and strike back.</p>
<p>Annie almost couldn’t believe what she was seeing. It was as if
Han Sen had grown eyes in the back of his head.</p>
<p>Strength and speed were things that could be vigorously trained
and improved upon, but this was something new to Annie, and she
wasn’t quite sure how he could have developed this power.</p>
<p>From what she was witnessing, she did not believe such precision
could come from a quick and accurate analysis of noise in the room,
either.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not make a single mistake – he was flawless. It was
as if he had rehearsed this before, and he knew each move every
droid was going to make. Annie didn’t believe even she could do
something such as that.</p>
<p>As time went by, Han Sen only seemed to get better and better.
It was as if he had achieved the Sight of Gods and was able to look
forward through time and pre-determine where and when each droid
was going to attack.</p>
<p>Combined with the Dongxuan Sutra, Han Sen had enabled what might
best be described as “Prophet Mode.” Every strike against him
seemed futile, and hitting him would most likely require surpassing
the speed of light.</p>
<p>Thirty-two robots were the maximum allowed inside the room at
once. Even with such a large number, none of them had even managed
to lay a finger on Han Sen. He annihilated each of them, and all it
took was one punch, his fists gliding through their metallic
exteriors with almost no resistance.</p>
<p>As if they were strapped into a noose, Annie’s eyebrows had
become incredibly tight. She thought Han Sen looked different, but
she couldn’t quite put her finger on why. She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>Annie wanted to report to Ji Ruo Zhen immediately about what she
had just witnessed. But as she continued to watch, she didn’t even
know how she might articulate the insane magnitude of Han Sen’s
precision as he fought.</p>
<p>After Han Sen had finished his testing, he quickly left the
lobby. Anni, however, remained in the observation room with a
recording of his practice, as she was keen to rewatch and review
what she had just seen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very impressed with his newfound abilities,
following his unlocking of the gene lock. Although he hadn’t been
granted any special, elementally-infused powers, what he had been
given made a massive difference. Han Sen thought it was sick.</p>
<p>He also appreciated how discreet his powers were At first sight,
no one would be able to tell he had actually unlocked his first
gene lock. He thought this could prove to be quite beneficial,
further down the road.</p>
<p>Returning to the shelter again, he found that Zhu Ting had been
looking for him. “Boss, I have found a sacred-blood creature. Come
and help me slay it!”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Han Sen agreed, partially due to the fact he still felt
guilty for what he had put Zhu Ting through with the red mushrooms.
He also agreed to go without the promise of a return.</p>
<p>Even though hunting sacred-blood creatures wasn’t a focus for
him right now, having unlocked his first gene lock, it would prove
to be far easier for him. He also imagined he could even take a
trip to the seabed, hunt freely in the ocean’s depths, and raise
the sacred geno points of his angels at a much quicker pace.</p>
<p>Following the speedy agreement, Zhu Ting led Han Sen to Devil’s
Mountain. But Han Sen frowned and said, “Since when have you been
coming to the Devil’s Mountain?”</p>
<p>Thunderdevil and his people used to tell tales about the
creatures that inhabited Devil’s Mountain and the special abilities
they possessed. It was a very dangerous place to venture.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I have only observed it from the foot of the
mountain. I have not dared to traverse its treacherous slopes,” Zhu
Ting explained.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded in response and did not say much. Unsure of what
lay ahead, he was at least confident of his ability to escape from
the clutches of a super creature, now that he had unlocked his gene
lock.</p>
<p>Not all super creatures actively pursued humans and sought to
kill them on sight, though, so Han Sen thought they’d be alright if
they kept out of their way.</p>
<p>The slopes of the mountain weren’t icy and snowy. Instead, they
were draped in fertile greens and dotted with luscious trees.</p>
<p>“Boss, there it is!” Zhu Ting was not lying. Having started
their climb of Devil’s Mountain, Zhu Ting pointed towards a
peculiar knoll.</p>
<p>This knoll he was pointing at skirted Devil’s Mountain at the
border of the Icefield.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Zhu Ting, and he led them up a small, craggy
knoll. A few vines and trees prospered atop it.</p>
<p>When they were halfway up the knoll, a lizard-looking creature
snagged their attention. It was eating the vines that wove their
way across a cliff that connected with the hilltop.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the creature, which was actually of
considerable size. It was about a meter long, and instead of
scales, it boasted beautiful blue skin. It looked to be a meaty
prize.</p>
<p>“Although this knoll may not be very high, it would be difficult
to fight it on the cliffside it is currently eating from,” Han Sen
said, after observing it for some time.</p>
<p>“If it was an easy task, I wouldn’t have come and requested your
aid. Do you have any suggestions?” Zhu Ting politely asked.</p>
<p>“I do. You wait here.” As Han Sen said this, he summoned his
blood-scale armor. He planted his legs firmly on the cliffside and
began running up.</p>
