<h2>Snow-Lady Beast Soul</h2>
<h3>Chapter 533</h3>

<p>There were a lot of negatives associated with the “Dual” sword
skill, and they created problems that would arise during combat.
This made Han Sen realize that creating a sword skill was no easy
task.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had no other choice. Any new sword skill creation
required vigorous combat testing, so he had to be patient and make
a note of every flaw he noticed during battle, in order to rectify
and improve later.</p>
<p>If there were any mistakes, he was free to make changes now, but
if a problem arose during a real field of battle, the price for
such a mistake would be paid in his own blood. Knowing this, Han
Sen was in no rush.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to improve over time as he tried to perfect
the dual-blade sword skill. Today Han Sen had visited the shelter
again. Li Xing Lun was there and found him, wearing a strange
facial expression.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I found a Humanoid sacred-blood fused transfigured
beast soul.” Li Xing Lun’s tone of voice was also somewhat
strange.</p>
<p>“Is its owner willing to trade?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Li Xing Lun did not answer directly, instead saying, “Earlier, I
sent out word that a friend was willing to swap a Berserk beast
soul for a Humanoid beast soul. Although many people wanted to
trade, and many people called me, Humanoid transfigured beast souls
were too rare and no-one was willing or able to make a trade like
that.”</p>
<p>Li Xing Lun paused for a moment, then continued. "Yesterday,
Blackgod contacted me. He said he wanted to use an Egregore soul to
trade for your Berserk beast soul.</p>
<p>“Does he really have an Egregore soul?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I looked. It is a sacred-blood class Snow-Lady beast soul.
The abilities of the Snow-Lady beast soul are quite special. It
does not increase one’s strength, just one’s speed. It also has the
ability to reduce one’s temperature, but that seems rather useless
to me. It would most likely just become a problem. I don’t think
it’s worth trading a Berserk beast soul for a Snow-Lady beast soul.
Plus, you had argued with Blackgod before,” Li Xing Lun said
severely.</p>
<p>“Did you say that it was me who wanted to trade?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“No, I only said that it was a friend.” Li Xing Lun shook his
head as he spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a moment about what to say, then said,
“That’s okay - feel free to tell him it’s me who wants to trade. If
he is willing, tell him to come here so we can complete the
transaction.”</p>
<p>Speed was what Han Sen needed most right now. The strongest
aspect of the Twin Spirit’s power was their speed. If he was able
to match with their speed and break their sword skill, the battle
would be much easier.</p>
<p>And combined with the beast soul’s ability to lower the body’s
temperature, for Han Sen, there was an absence of negatives. The
“Jadeskin” skill worked even better in a cold environment, so not
only was it of no detriment to Han Sen, it was an outright
benefit.</p>
<p>For others, this would have been a debilitating attribute, but
Han Sen would be glad to receive it.</p>
<p>Besides, to find a Humanoid sacred-blood beast soul was
extremely difficult in the ice fields. It was good to be able to
trade a Snow-Lady beast soul, which was not too far from a Humanoid
beast soul. Han Sen was satisfied at the proposal of this
trade.</p>
<p>“You really want to make this trade with Blackgod?” Li Xing Lun
asked. “You really have to consider this well. If you trade your
Berserk beast soul with Blackgod, he may use it against you in the
future.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “Thank you for your concern,” he said. “If I am
willing to trade this with him, of course I am not afraid of his
ownership of the beast soul.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then. Did you bring the beast soul? Tell me about your
situation and I will talk to Blackgod,” Li Xing Lun smiled.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Han Sen had already raised the Inferno
Bull into a Berserk beast soul. When he summoned it, it combined
with his body to become a black-winged bull.</p>
<p>He told the specific attributes of the Inferno Bull to Li Xing
Lun, all the while muttering, “It’s a shame”. A beast soul that was
able to greatly increase one’s strength and which provided the
ability of flight was much stronger than the Snow-Lady of Blackgod;
one which appeared to be inherently flawed.</p>
<p>The Snow-Lady beast soul, aside from being Humanoid and
providing a passable speed boost, did not appear to be anything
special. The ability to lower one’s own temperature seemed
pointless and stupid.</p>
<p>But Han Sen insisted on making the trade, so Li Xing Lun went
off to talk with Blackgod.</p>
<p>Han Sen waited a day. On the second day he went to the shelter.
Li Xing Lun was there and he had already spoken to Blackgod. Aside
from the Snow-Lady, Li Xing Lun had managed to bargain for an
additional two Mutant beast souls.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Brother Lun. But for those two Mutant beast souls,
we should share them. Let’s take one each.” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>But Li Xing Lun did not want any, no matter what. He only told
Han Sen that after the saving of the Starwheel Shelter, it was an
honor to help.</p>
<p>It was time to trade with Blackgod. Blackgod had brought people
with him to the Starwheel Shelter. He noticed that Han Sen’s eyes
were a little cold, but of this he made no mention.</p>
<p>After they both observed the beast souls they were to receive,
they handed their own over to Li Xing Lun. Then Li Xing Lun
completed the trade by handing the beast souls over to their new
owners. The transaction was smooth and without incident.</p>
<p>Han Sen received the two Mutant beast souls and Snow-Lady beast
soul. He looked them over to ensure no mistakes had been made, and
while he was getting ready to bid Li Xing Lun farewell, Blackgod
called to him.</p>
<p>Blackgod looked at Han Sen with disdain, and coldly said, “Han
Sen, you dare gamble with me? Perhaps now we can settle our
grudge.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Han Sen furrowed his eyebrows in
response.</p>
<p>“You and I engage in battle. Regardless of who wins or loses,
our grudge can be settled.” Blackgod looked at Han Sen and
continued, “Of course, if you do lose, you must leave behind the
Snow-Lady beast soul. If I lose, however, I can leave behind the
Inferno Bull beast soul.”</p>
<p>Li Xing Lun frowned and said, “Blackgod, we only want to
exchange beast souls on this day. Nothing else.”</p>
<p>“I am merely suggesting a solution to our grudge. It is entirely
up to him if he wants to partake in my idea. If he does not dare to
engage me in battle, that is fine,” Blackgod said sternly.</p>
<p>“What if I do not wish to gamble?” Han Sen looked at Blackgod as
he asked.</p>
<p>“If you do not wish to settle our prolonged dispute, then you
will become my enemy. And I do not go soft on those I deem to be my
enemy.”</p>
<p>The few people who had accompanied Blackgod now summoned their
beast souls.</p>
<p>“Blackgod, this is the Starwheel Shelter. This is not Blackgod
Shelter.” Li Xing Lun’s eyes went cold, and he summoned a few
leaders from the Starwheel Shelter to push back against Blackgod’s
people.</p>
<p>“Li Xing Lun, this is about me and Han Sen. This is none of your
business.” Blackgod furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“I am the notary of the exchange; I do not care for your grudge
with Han Sen, but in my Starwheel Shelter, none can lay a finger on
him.” Li Xing Lun’s eyes were firm, hesitation and the desire to
hold back entirely absent from them.</p>
<p>“Li Xing Lun, do you really want to offend me on the behalf of a
person who doesn’t even matter?” Blackgod looked at Li Xing Lun
sternly.</p>
<p>“Han Sen saved me when the Starwheel Shelter was in crisis. He
is my savior; no one can do him any harm before me.” Li Xing Lun
said these words directly.</p>
<p>Blackgod’s emotion began to change, the atmosphere inside the
Shelter growing tense. It was like a room that was packed to the
brim with explosives, where the presence of a single spark would be
enough to ignite the volatile atmosphere.</p>
<p>“It is okay to have a one-on-one, but the beast souls that we
gamble must be held onto by Li Xing Lun.” Han Sen said all of a
sudden.</p>
<p>“That is no problem.” Blackgod agreed to the terms, as he knew
all about Li Xing Lun’s identity. He knew he was not the sort to
accept the beast souls and make a run for it.</p>
<p>There was also the fact that Blackgod’s purpose there was not
merely to win a beast soul - he wanted Han Sen’s life.</p>
<p>Han Sen had stolen the Snake Fish King in the past and used a
poison dagger to hurt him. This had almost taken Blackgod’s life,
and was the cause of the anger that he could never find it in
himself to swallow.</p>
