<h2>One Mouth and a Demigod</h2>
<h3>Chapter 864</h3>

<p>Zhuo Donglai watched the screen with an excitement in his heart.
It reminded him of himself, in the days of his youth.</p>
<p>“He is not from the Luo family, and he did not practice
Falsified-Sky Sutra. This is interesting, and now I have come to
the decision that yes, I will recruit him as my student.” Zhuo
Donglai smiled.</p>
<p>It was difficult to believe that a Luo family member hadn’t
learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra but had still become so
powerful.</p>
<p>His skills were top-tier. They weren’t associated with movement
and power, and from what he had seen of Han Sen’s operation of a
warframe, Zhuo Donglai learnt a lot.</p>
<p>“It is an interesting thing, for him to become so powerful
without learning the Falsified-Sky Sutra.” Zhuo Donglai had a few
extra thoughts about this, but he did not dwell on them. His mind
swiftly moved on to think, “He is not from the Luo family, and
neither does he want to be. His name is Han. Haha! I can’t wait to
see what comes of this.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Only God could have kept count of the hundreds of slashes the
SKTS delivered to King of War, but it finally broke. And with King
of War’s breaking, the fight came to an end.</p>
<p>Li Chengxian did not say a word following his defeat. Upon his
exit, he quickly summoned for his men to depart alongside him. He
was far too ashamed of his performance to muster a single word,
since he was a Royal Warframe Team operator who had just lost to an
old, outdated SKTS.</p>
<p>Footage of the fight had been uploaded to Skynet. The
full-length video was titled SKTS Murders King of War, and it
didn’t take long for it go viral.</p>
<p>After watching the video, many people were flabbergasted. Many
warframe lovers wondered if they had what it took to do as the SKTS
did.</p>
<p>Those efforts turned out badly, however. A few days after the
video was uploaded, there were reports of countless SKTS kits being
destroyed and their operators injured. No one was able to replicate
what they had seen in the video.</p>
<p>As a result, many people believed the video had been faked, and
its fight was staged. But when people thought about the fact that
the video included Han Sen and a member of the Royal Warframe Team,
they questioned why those two would do such a thing. Them faking a
battle did not seem likely.</p>
<p>For the Royal Warframe Team to suffer such a defeat was
humiliating, and many people could not help but say, “There is an
operator called The Alpha. Others can’t do what he does, and the
skills he knows are etched into his bones.”</p>
<p>Han Sen, Fat Squad Leader, and his friends celebrated the
victory together. Delighted over the result, they all decided to
get wasted. Later that night, Han Sen wobbled his way to the
bathroom.</p>
<p>When he was in front of the door, an old man walked out. Han Sen
was so drunk, he didn’t even look at him properly.</p>
<p>This was the Alliance. Unlike in the sanctuaries, you always had
to be alert—even in a drunken stupor.</p>
<p>So, when Han Sen passed the old man, he felt as if the old man’s
eyes were incredibly bright. He glanced towards them.</p>
<p>As he looked, Han Sen froze. His pupils went smaller and his
eyes were sapped of the joy they once possessed.</p>
<p>“Kid, take my mind test. If you pass, I will allow you to be my
student,” Zhuo Donglai cockily said.</p>
<p>As a demigod, Zhuo Donglai was incredibly talented in the realm
of influencing the wills of others and performing illusions. In
demigod fights, he was able to make others lose their attention and
fall into a false reality that he had devised.</p>
<p>Han Sen was merely an evolver, and helpless to resist.
Therefore, Zhuo Donglai wished to test Han Sen’s willpower, faith,
and resolve. If he passed, he would be sufficiently qualified to be
Zhuo Donglai’s apprentice. If his faith was warped, then that meant
he did not have what it took yet.</p>
<p>People could learn any skill they wanted, and they could become
as powerful as they wanted, too. The only inhibitor to achieving
such lofty goals was a person’s faith and dedication to the
cause.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai walked in front of Han Sen and brought him to sit
down. Han Sen’s attention was vacant now, for he had been placed in
Zhuo Donglai’s Infinite Mind Trial. For surpassers, it
traditionally took them an hour to escape it.</p>
<p>“Kid, suffer a little. When you come out, you will obey me.”
Zhuo Donglai thought about how Han Sen might respect him following
the trial, and smiled with jittery excitement.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai placed a hand on Han Sen’s shoulder, and when he
did, Han Sen burped. Following that, a wretched noise sounded.
“Blergh!” Han Sen threw up all over Zhuo Donglai.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai was caught at unawares. On any other occasion, he’d
dodge without trouble, but he had become too self-obsessed, and his
excitement over Han Sen had gotten the best of him. While thinking
about how incredible his Infinite Mind Trial was, and how he’d
present himself as Han Sen’s new boss, the projectile vomiting
caught him off-guard.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very drunk at this point. Becoming dizzy under the
influence of Infinite Mind Trial was the straw that broke the
camel’s black and opened the floodgates of his stomach.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other for a second, and after
acknowledging the situation, Han Sen said, “I am so sorry!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.” Zhuo Donglai lowered his head and left, not wanting
Han Sen to see his face.</p>
<p>He didn’t look like the strong man that he was right now,
especially since he was covered in puke. If he told Han Sen he was
a demigod and wished to recruit him as a student, Han Sen was sure
to believe he was an old man who had escaped the loony bin.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! Why did he not get lost in my Infinite Mind Trial?
This is crazy.” Zhuo Donglai was shocked.</p>
<p>“It fortunate that guy was a pleasant person. If he wasn’t, I
would sure be in trouble. I should avoid throwing up on people in
the future, I think.” Han Sen, merry as a cricket, continued his
wobble towards the bathroom.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai, on the other hand, quickly left Moka Planet.
Although he wanted to spend more time with Han Sen, it’d be awkward
if he was recognized after their drunken encounter.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhuo Donglai thought he might wait a while longer.
He’d change his hairstyle and shave his beard, so by the next time
they met, Han Sen would be none the wiser.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so drunk, he’d never believe he had thrown up on a
demigod.</p>
<p>The training on Moka Planet lasted half a month, in total. When
it was over, nothing came of it all. There were no adventures or
excursions planned for them inside the ruins or anything. It had
been a long time Daphne received a mission.</p>
<p>So, following this, Han Sen decided to return to the sanctuary.
Wang Yuhang was still in Moment Shelter, so Han Sen traveled to
Devil-Blood Shelter in his company. They wanted to see if they
could deal one final strike and destroy the shelter.</p>
<p>The Devil-Blood King had mostly lost everything, so Han Sen was
willing to assume all of the super creatures he had brought with
him for the golden chests had been killed. At the most, only seven
now remained. And if there were, Han Sen believed he could beat
them.</p>
<p>His confidence had grown because he now owned the Silver-Blood
Macaque.</p>
