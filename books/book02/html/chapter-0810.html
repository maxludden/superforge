<h2>Summoning a Pet</h2>
<h3>Chapter 810</h3>

<p>Han Sen chased after Wang Yuhang, and as he went, he sensed
countless scary lifeforces making their way towards the Empty Vine.
They had all been disturbed and made restless by the human
intruders.</p>
<p>There was still a while to go before the Empty Fruit ripened.
The group of people had no idea when exactly it would mature, and
going for them now would only lead to the creatures stopping them.
If they picked the fruit before it became ripe, the benefits of its
consumption would be far weaker, not worth the effort.</p>
<p>Even Han Sen, who had received help from super creatures in the
past, couldn’t help but feel unnerved and a little scared when he
sensed the number of creatures in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>“I hope those people don’t all die. If they do, how am I
supposed to interrogate them?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Racing across the length of two mountains, Han Sen finally
caught up to the fleet-footed Wang Yuhang. The owl did not relent
in its attacks, and all the while, Wang Yuhang stumbled, tripped,
and scrambled on his way. He had sustained much damage this time.
His armor had been pecked at, and much of it had been broken. His
skin had been pierced, and blood was drawn.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t heavily injured, his face was one of great
pity and remorse.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly summoned his little angel to prevent the owl
from continuing its pursuit of Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>“Bossman, you have finally come!” Wang Yuhang shouted excitedly.
Not caring for the lesions and wounds that riddled his person, he
went towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Wait! Do not come any closer. Continue drawing its attention
while we finish it.” Han Sen quickly stopped Wang Yuhang from
approaching him.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang promptly agreed, and with his bow, fired an arrow
towards the owl to attract its ire once more. When the owl went
after him, the little angel was able to quickly get in its way
again and block it.</p>
<p>When Wang Yuhang noticed the owl’s inability to reach him, he
went a little mad. He fired arrows like a loon, maniacally
cackling, “Come here, little birdy! I’m right here! I make for
terrific creature cuisine, so why do you not attempt to eat me?”
After he had taunted it for some time, the owl stopped and made a
noise akin to the crying of a baby.</p>
<p>“Haha! Crying is of little use, little birdy-bird. Come on, come
over here… Ouch!” Wang Yuhang continued his fun in the provocation
of the owl.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a big rat came out of the ground. It was one foot
long, and when it emerged, it leapt up and bit his ass. Its razor
teeth pierced right through his armor and sunk deep into his plump
bottom. When it pulled away, a chunk of Wang Yuhang’s bum-flesh was
torn away.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang held his buttocks and screamed, and as he did so,
many other black rats emerged from the ground. They ran towards him
like the tide of the sea.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Does this wretch possess the ability to summon a legion
of rats to its devilish will? I beseech your aid! Help!” Wang
Yuhang summoned a spear and swung it around crazily. But their
numbers were unfathomable, and after killing a dozen, he could
still see countless more headed his way.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to scan the rats. He was
surprised to see that the rats were not actually creatures, and as
a result, possessed no lifeforce. They must have been direct
summons of the owl, an ability not unlike the silver beetle
mother.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe this owl can summon its own little mobs. This
is rather interesting.” Han Sen summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and
hurried over to the owl. As he went, he called out, “Little Uncle,
hold on! I’m going to kill this bird.”</p>
<p>“Then I beg that you make haste. I shan’t last very much longer,
if something is not done about these arse-biters soon. Ouch!”
Another rat bit Wang Yuhang. This time, it leapt up and ripped out
a piece of his arm.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right there.” Han Sen’s eyes shone with the light of
murder.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The Flaming Rex Spike was swung upwards, and with the little
angel’s cooperation, it was driven harshly against the owl’s body.
The owl was knocked a great distance away.</p>
<p>The little angel flew forward at once and delivered another
slash to the owl. Then, Han Sen used his rex spike to hit it
again.</p>
<p>The first-generation owl didn’t stand a chance, and it was
getting destroyed by the duo with no reprieve. Feathers fell and
blood rained.</p>
<p>The owl, thinking it best to escape, had its departure prevented
by Han Sen. He grabbed onto it, pulling back the heavily-injured
owl.</p>
<p>Pat! Pat! Pat!</p>
<p>Beneath the siege of attacks that were delivered onto it, the
owl didn’t have a single chance of fighting back. In minutes, the
head of the owl was lopped off by a mighty swing of the little
angel’s greatsword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Super Creature Spirit Owl Killed. Beast Soul Gained. The Flesh
Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno
Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super
Geno Points Randomly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was overjoyed to hear this, as it had been a while since
he last received a beast soul. He curiously pondered what manner of
beast soul it might be.</p>
<p>And with the death of the owl, the carnivorous rats vanished
too. Wang Yuhang looked at Han Sen with much surprise and said,
“Bossman, your strength continues to grow greater and greater. It
only took you a few minutes to lay utter waste to a super
creature!”</p>
<p>“I was taking my time.” Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang and
proceeded to say, “You should go home; you should leave this place.
As for myself, there is something else I must attend to.”</p>
<p>“I am coming with you. That legion of scum deserves death for
what they did to me,” Wang Yuhang said with anger. When his mind
went back to his mistreatment, and the time he spent caged, he
began to tremble with rage.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t worry about that. The scum will all be dead before
long, I assure you,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“What?” Wang Yuhang asked with surprise. Then, he asked, “Do
other super creatures inhabit the treacherous lands of the
vicinity?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there are loads. If you hate those people that much, and
you would like to put your life on the line just so you can watch
them get brutally torn apart, then let’s go.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang’s face locked up. He looked as if he was about to
say something, but just as he was, a black flame erupted from the
Empty Vine like a volcano.</p>
<p>“Um, Bossman? I have a charliehorse; so, I think I’ll just wait
for you down there somewhere… You be careful, okay?” After saying
this, Wang Yuhang hastily made his departure from the island.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to take a look at the Spirit Owl beast soul he
had acquired. It was another pet-type beast soul.</p>
<p>“This is interesting. If I raise this owl, I’ll almost have an
army of super creatures at my disposal.” Han Sen was as delighted
as he was curious. Still, he knew it would take a while before the
pet could enter battle-mode.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was getting the hang of killing super creatures now,
and he imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a struggle.</p>
<p>The Death Knell drank blood, whereas the Spirit Owl ate meat.
This meant he could raise them together, without any conflict
between the two arising.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have the time to look at the Spirit Owl for
long. He returned his gaze to the Empty Vine, and when he did, he
heard many roars accompanying the clanging sounds of various
weaponry. The fight seemed to be raging.</p>
<p>“I hope the Devil-Blood King is already there. If not, that’d be
a pain.” Han Sen, continuing to look at the Empty Vine as he
ventured there, was suddenly approached by a few men. It was
Manager Qu and a few others.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to be doing all that well. They had already
injected themselves with the shura liquid, and they seemed to be
grievously injured.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” When they saw Han Sen, their faces changed. They knew
exactly who he was.</p>
