<p>The Blue Crystal team found Luo Sulan out near the mountains and
quickly brought her back to the shelter. Wu Qinggang killed one
sacred-blood creature and managed to chase away the other two
before returning himself.</p>
<p>The Blue Crystal team believed things were not as simple as they
might have initially seemed, as those sacred-blood creatures should
not have appeared where they were in the first place. But aside
from their intrusion, nothing else happened; Luo Sulan was
safe.</p>
<p>Although it was strange, Luo Sulan’s safety was all that
mattered. After she returned to the shelter, she teleported to the
Alliance.</p>
<p>Near the base of the mountains, the ground seemed disrupted. The
soil seemed fresh, as if something had been recently buried.</p>
<p>“Mom, are you okay?” Qin Xuan had told Han Sen what had occurred
at the shelter, and he found it strange, as well. But if they
wanted to bring harm to his mother, it didn’t seem like the
attraction of the three sacred-blood creatures would be enough.</p>
<p>“I’m fine; what could have possibly happened to me?” Luo Sulan
asked.</p>
<p>“Mom, I may have offended someone in the shelter. They have
tried to come at me already, but they were unsuccessful. Since they
couldn’t not take out their grievances on me, I fear they may come
for you—my family—in response. As such, I don’t believe you should
leave the safety of the Alliance for the time being,” Han Sen told
her directly.</p>
<p>He could not hide things from his mother, and for the issue that
currently concerned him, he had to tell her the entire truth so she
could understand the gravity of the situation. If she did not, and
happily left the safety of the Alliance, she might find herself in
trouble.</p>
<p>What had happened was strange, yes; but Han Sen did not want
anything else to happen to her. Until he reached his mother’s
location, he did not want her to leave the Alliance.</p>
<p>“Little Sen, who did you offend? Will something happen?” Luo
Sulan worriedly asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I can handle all this. Your son is strong now,”
Han Sen smiled as he spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s my fault, for being unable to protect you,” Luo Sulan
spoke, with a tone of sadness.</p>
<p>“Mom, it was difficult enough for you to raise me. Now, I should
be the one protecting you,” Han Sen quickly told her.</p>
<p>“Little Sen, do you still have your great grandfather’s relic?”
Luo Sulan asked him, seemingly randomly.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Do not worry for that, Mom. I always carry this
pendant,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“All right, then.” A look of relief then washed over Luo
Sulan.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>After hanging up the communicator, Luo Sulan’s expression was
complicated. She thought to herself, “After all these years spent
working so hard, can we still not escape this loop?”</p>
<p>After Han Sen confirmed his mother’s safety, he decided to
resume his journey to the Blue Crystal shelter.</p>
<p>The Black Desert. An endless black desert that looked like the
inside of hell’s furnace. The colors were bleak and hopeless, far
more depressing than an average desert.</p>
<p>Han Sen was riding Golden Growler through the Black Desert, and
because of the region’s vast size and barren wastes, he looked
lonely and small in its midst.</p>
<p>“I wish I did not have to eat or drink. At least I would feel
better in this damn place, if I did not have to.” Han Sen had been
on his traversal of the Black Desert for six days, before realizing
he was lost.</p>
<p>A massive black sandstorm had kicked up two days prior, which
was quite threatening. It did not harm Han Sen, but in his escape,
he ended up losing all sense of direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen now focused on walking in a single direction, in the
hope he could wander out of the Black Desert before exhausting all
of his nutrient solutions.</p>
<p>The silver fox didn’t look comfortable under the sunlight. It
still remained perched on Han Sen’s shoulder, but it used its own
tail as a shield or fluffy parasol to block the sunlight. It also
yawned a lot.</p>
<p>“A shelter?” Han Sen saw a really large building in the middle
of the black sands he traversed, which made him open his eyes
wide.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t a human shelter, and as long as it wasn’t a
super shelter, he could venture inside and obtain a new spirit. If
he did that, he could teleport back to the Alliance and have a hot
shower. He could rest, restock, and prepare himself once more.</p>
<p>Han Sen hurried his Golden Growler, wanting to approach the
place faster. He keenly observed the shelter as he drew closer and
closer. It was fairly small, so he became certain that it wasn’t a
super shelter. From how small it actually seemed, it didn’t even
seem royal shelter-sized. He assumed it was more likely a noble
shelter.</p>
<p>But when he got closer, Han Sen began to feel a little
disturbed. The shelter looked a little dishevelled and rugged. It
didn’t look to be in total ruin, but it most certainly looked like
an ancient city that had been abandoned a long time ago.</p>
<p>“This cannot be an abandoned shelter. Oh, please, God… let the
teleporter still be functional,” Han Sen prayed in his heart.</p>
<p>As he got closer to the Yellowstone City, things were not as bad
as they initially seemed. It was indeed a human shelter, and before
the front gate, he noticed a giant parasol had been placed. Under
the parasol was a sunbathing bench with a person lying on it.</p>
<p>There was a beautiful woman lying there.</p>
<p>She had nice long legs with short black hair. Her butt was firm
and round like a peach, whose limelight was only stolen by her
large boobies. Her waist was slim but solid, and you could espy a
little muscle there.</p>
<p>In the middle of this boring black desert, Han Sen’s eyes almost
fell out at how amazing this sight was.</p>
<p>How could Han Sen see it so clearly?</p>
<p>Because the short-haired lady was naked, sunbathing on the bench
in a relaxed posture.</p>
<p>“Are my eyes playing tricks? Am I suffering a hallucination,
having been in the Black Desert too long? Maybe it really is a
mirage!” Han Sen rubbed his eyes hard, wanting to confirm what he
was seeing was actually true.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone City was still there. The parasol and the
sunbathing bench were still there, as was the beautiful lady.</p>
<p>But Han Sen still did not believe it to be true. He put the
Golden Growler back in the Sea of Soul and sped up his approach to
the Yellowstone City. He ran there as fast as his legs could carry
him.</p>
<p>As Han Sen got closer and closer, the image of the place he had
discovered became clearer and clearer. It really did seem like a
real place that existed.</p>
<p>“No way. Is this for real? There is no way I’m this lucky. It
doesn’t make sense to have a pretty, naked woman sunbathing here in
the desert. This must be a hallucination; it must be! The Black
Desert does not have a human shelter.” Han Sen did not believe what
he was seeing was actually true.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman lay in front of Han Sen, facing down. She
wore sunglasses, and beside her was some juice and snacks. She
appeared to be asleep.</p>
<p>“Hallucination! It has to be a hallucination!” Han Sen was now
in front of the short-haired lady. He reached his hand out to grab
the woman’s bubble-butt to confirm the validity of his vision, and
was surprised to feel that her skin was smooth and bouncy to the
touch. He could even feel the sunscreen that had been rubbed
in.</p>
<p>“Hm, maybe I was wrong. This does seem real!” Han Sen thought it
felt really good, so he squeezed her butt some more.</p>
<p>A second later, however, the short-haired lady woke up. She
turned her head in a sleepy fashion and said, “Little Orange, don’t
do that. I’m trying to sunbathe here.”</p>
<p>When her eyesight came into focus, and she saw Han Sen with a
hand still firmly clasped on her buttock, she completely froze.</p>
<p>They both locked gazes with each other for a few seconds before
the woman snapped, which led to a scream echoing across the Black
Desert.</p>
