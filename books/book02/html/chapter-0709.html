<h2>The King’s Declaration</h2>
<h3>Chapter 709</h3>

<p>In addition to his supreme fitness level, Han Sen wore berserk
super armor. He also simulated the cub’s energy flow to make his
body not far-off the strength of obsidian. That was how he managed
to shrug off Queen’s attacks.</p>
<p>If he had not simulated that energy, the armor itself would not
have been enough. After all, Queen knew how to make use of Yin
Force, and no armor could withstand all that power.</p>
<p>“It looks like my absorption of Life Geno essences is going to
be exposed.” Han Sen had known exposure would be inevitable when he
went up against the final spirit, but he hadn’t counted on meeting
Queen and having it revealed so early.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was prepared for the world to know, anyway. He was
playing the role of the enigmatic Dollar, and no one would be able
to find him once the matches were over.</p>
<p>In the next two fights, he met humans again. When his would-be
opponents walked on stage, however, they did not fight him.</p>
<p>“Dollar; I am a fan of yours. Can I have your signature?” A two
meter tall big man stood in front of Han Sen looking shy, and
handed over a pen and paper.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze for a second, expecting another match. He didn’t
expect someone who had come so far to give up the fight and instead
ask for a signature. He took the pen and paper and scribbled his
name down.</p>
<p>He was not worried about someone recognizing his hand-writing.
He could control his body well enough to mask his handwriting, so
he used a style no one would be able to trace back to him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you!” The big man greatly appreciated his
autograph, and then quickly exited the stage.</p>
<p>The second human opponent was not as fanatical as the other man,
fortunately. He did tell Han Sen something, though. He said, “Good
luck, Dollar. You have our support. Go and become a Son of God.”
Then, he also gave up the fight and exited the stage.</p>
<p>The last opponent of the day was a royal spirit. Han Sen killed
it with a single blow, which made humanity super happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not stay for long, afterwards. He quickly made his
leave and returned to the privacy of the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan had never been so excited. The media-man’s soul
was burning with the fire of unadulterated passion.</p>
<p>Dollar’s words lingered on the minds of many, but they
particularly stood out to Fang Mingquan; “I am not here to fight
humans”.</p>
<p>Returning to the office, Fang Mingquan wrote an article called,
“I am Not Here to Fight Humans – The King’s Declaration,” and
posted it.</p>
<p>It described Dollar’s fights over the previous two days. He made
sure to highlight Dollar’s most profound line.</p>
<p>In the end, Fang Mingquan wrote, “The king has returned; his
sword directed to the position of becoming a Son of God. Will
Dollar become humanity’s first Son of God?”</p>
<p>The day held unparalleled fervor and excitement. They were
hopeful for Dollar’s performance in the future, hoping he would
stand as a representation for humanity’s position amongst the Son
of God’s.</p>
<p>But the real shock came from the Alliance’s office. Normal
people only understood he was strong; they didn’t quite grasp the
full extent of his strength like others might have.</p>
<p>The high-class officers of the Alliance were aware Dollar must
have absorbed Life Geno essences. They also knew he was wearing a
super beast soul armor. If he wasn’t, they knew he couldn’t
possibly have possessed such insane defense.</p>
<p>Even Queen could do nothing before him, and as a result, they
were certain this was so.</p>
<p>A lot of people were excited and curious about this development.
They were almost salivating at the prospect of Dollar proving that
humans could indeed absorb Life Geno essences. Their
inquisitiveness of how he had done so was difficult to temper.</p>
<p>A lot of people wanted to find out, but they did not know how to
get in contact with the elusive Dollar.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the leaders of every faction issued a
decree to seek out the man behind the mask; they wanted to find
Dollar. The matter of Life Geno essence absorption was a concern of
the human race and it was crucial for the development of humanity.
They had to find out who Dollar was, no matter what. They had to
learn, from the horse’s mouth, what Dollar knew.</p>
<p>Many people analyzed the information they had on Dollar, in an
attempt to predict who Dollar might be. They composed a list of
suspects, one which contained the name Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen and Dollar had appeared in the same area many times,
as well as at different locations at the same time. This led to his
name being crossed from the list.</p>
<p>Not many people owned a doppelganger beast soul. People only
knew Han Sen and Ning Yue had one, so no one considered this
possibility.</p>
<p>Ning Yue was there watching Divinity’s Bout, as well; this made
him think of something. Not being wholly certain, he didn’t let
people know what he was thinking of just yet.</p>
<p>The aqua reaper lived inside him, and his thoughts and life were
in Han Sen’s hands. If he did something to displease Han Sen, he’d
be a dead man.</p>
<p>Han Sen won the next few matches, which led to the generation of
another major topic in the Alliance. Everyone was talking about
whether or not Dollar could truly be the next Son of God. They
wondered if he could beat the Light Son of God.</p>
<p>Because of his amazing performance thus far, many people were
extremely hopeful at this prospect. A lot of people who did not
care about Divinity’s Bout started caring about it a lot more.</p>
<p>When people watched Dollar fight, the ferocity drew them in and
made them feel as if they were a part of the battle themselves.
This wasn’t a simple series of fights anymore; it was a conquest
for obtaining glory for all humanity.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was only fighting for himself, to humanity at
large, he was doing something no one else could. He was committing
a selfless deed for the rest of the human race, they thought.</p>
<p>Even though Dollar had his fair share of detractors, they still
hoped he could achieve glory for humanity and win.</p>
<p>Especially the old men who had been in the Second God’s
Sanctuary for a century. They had lived their entire lives in the
Second God’s Sanctuary, and throughout their lifetimes, all they
had heard was how miserable humans were doing in Divinity’s Bout.
Although they looked like they didn’t care, they still secretly
harbored a desire for humanity to excel and win the tournament.
They wanted someone to get payback on the spirits more than
anything.</p>
<p>They acted like they did not care because they could not do
anything about it. The efforts of every generation had led to
countless deaths and innumerable injuries. Disappointment was the
only reward for such grievances, and thus, they lacked hope. They
continued to pretend as if they didn’t care, even going so far as
to make jokes about the event.</p>
<p>But when the hope came, even if it was only a little, they were
excited. And they prayed and bid their wishes upon the people or
person who showed the most promise.</p>
<p>The people who were older would feel an even greater amount of
glory.</p>
<p>“Old Hui, have you heard about this year’s Divinity’s Bout? That
Dollar there is pretty good, and maybe there is a chance this year
will be the one.” A lot of excited old men shared the news of Han
Sen’s many victories.</p>
<p>Over 80% of human evolvers were focused on Divinity’s Bout for
the first time. The media began reporting as much as they could on
the event. Most reports were about Dollar, his past, present, and
possible future legacies.</p>
<p>Overnight, Dollar became a legendary figure to the entire
Alliance. His name was on the tip of everyone’s tongue. The fame he
received was different than what he received in the past. This
time, Dollar was shouldering the glory of all humanity. He
possessed a figurative halo that separated him from traditional
celebrities, as well.</p>
<p>Even Han Sen himself did not expect things to turn out this way.
Even in the military base, soldiers and officers ravenously talked
about Dollar and Divinity’s Bout.</p>
