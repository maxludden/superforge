<p>“For this, what do you think?” Li Mingtang said casually, and
his skin suddenly turned into gold. Instantaneously, he had a gold
body, looking like the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>“Super Diamond Body! You obtained Super Diamond Body!” Han Sen
was shocked, watching Li Mingtang with a golden body.</p>
<p>“I started when I was three years old and had spent more than
six decades practicing it. All I have achieved is initial success.”
Li Mingtang said quietly, without any intention to brag.</p>
<p>“What is Super Diamond Body?” Han Sen asked, puzzled. The name
sounds like some cheeky cartoon he used to watch on the Skynet.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran explained, “There are numerous hyper geno arts adapted
from ancient martial arts, so there are all kinds of rankings.
However, no matter which ranking you see, Super Diamond Body is
always in the top ten. Super Diamond Body was adapted from the
ancient martial art Indestructible Diamond Body. If you could
practice it to the extreme, even plasma cannons could not hurt you.
However, it is so hard to practice that a hundred years might be
just a start. Therefore, not a lot of people dare to try this hyper
geno art. However, once achieving something, one’s body would be
absolutely peerless among people with the same status.”</p>
<p>“It is not that impressive as the captain said. I have only
achieved initial success. If someone has a fitness level above one
hundred and twenty, it would be easy for him to break up my body.”
Li Mingtang paused and said, “In fact, you do not need to be my
enemies. I did not mean to take your lives anyway, otherwise
Captain, you will not be able to live until this moment. In this
Crystallizer king ruin full of crises, an extra person means extra
force. We should all cooperate in order to have a bigger chance at
survival, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“Cooperation, yes. However, you must at least tell us about your
goal to enter this Crystallizer royalty ruin. We do not want to die
without knowing why,” after consulting his girlfriend, Han Sen said
to Li Mingtang.</p>
<p>“In fact, it will do you no good knowing about these. You’d be
better off not know.” Li Mingtang sighed.</p>
<p>“Since you want to cooperate with us, you must have something
you need us for. If we follow you without asking, we would probably
die without knowing the reason,” Han Sen said coldly.</p>
<p>“You are indeed smart people.” Li Mingtang paused and continued,
“Actually, I could tell you and it’s fine. Captain, you should know
that this Crystallizer ruin was discovered decades ago?”</p>
<p>“I heard that an interstellar exploration ship found this
place.” Ji Yanran thought about it and said.</p>
<p>Li Mingtang nodded slightly and said, “Indeed. The exploration
ship found this Crystallizer royalty ruin and sent a team to
explore it. However, none of them came back. After that, the
Alliance sent a warship similar to Daphne here and none of the
people came back alive either.”</p>
<p>“Did you know what had happened?” Ji Yanran said.</p>
<p>“No,” Li Mingtang shook his head and said with his eyes
glistening, “However, my late father was the captain of the
exploration ship that discovered the ruin in the first place. After
he came here, he never went back. All I want to find is his
remains.”</p>
<p>“Professor, you must think we are three-year-olds? It is so
obvious that you and Wang Hou both want something here. Don’t tell
me that Wang Hou is also looking for his dad’s remains,” Han Sen
said quietly.</p>
<p>Li Mingtang smiled and said, “Of course, the reason we entered
the ruin was also for something the captain of the Alliance warship
brought to the ruin.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“A Crystallizer key. Legend has it that as long as you have that
key, you could initiate the core of Crystallizer ruins and control
all the crystals.” Li Mingtang was full of excitement.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine what would happen if humans could control those
magnificent Crystallizer technologies? It will make human
technology jump ahead three hundred years.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that the reason you’re looking for that Crystallizer
key is not to enhance human technologies,” Han Sen said coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that the so-called exploration ship was actually
pirate ships which grabbed the fortunes in the universe that had
been overlooked.</p>
<p>For Li Mingtang’s father, the captain of an exploration ship was
a euphemism of interstellar pirate.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you everything you want to know. Choose whether or
not you want to cooperate with me.” Li Mingtang did not answer Han
Sen’s question but said to the couple.</p>
<p>“One last question, what do you need us for?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“There is an area ahead of us that neither Wang Hou nor I
managed to go through. We also lost each other. Unexpectedly, I ran
into you guys. I now have an idea– the three of us work together to
pass that area to reach the core of the Crystallizer ruin. When we
arrive there, you could take the crystals in the treasure, which
are what the Alliance wants anyways. And I could take the
Crystallizer key, what do you think?” Li Mingtang said.</p>
<p>“Deal.” Han Sen had decided on the reply with Ji Yanran minutes
ago, so he agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go then. When we are in the area, I will then tell
you in details what to do. We should not mess around with this,
otherwise all three of us will be in danger,” Li Mingtang said and
walked out of the hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Li Mingtang, holding Ji Yanran’s hand. Looking
around, he couldn’t help praising the greatness of Crystallizer
civilization. Even now, the Alliance could hardly build such an
integrated architecture covering the entire planet without
affecting the planet’s self-regulating system, which was simply
magnificent.</p>
<p>Li Mingtang carefully led the way ahead of them, telling them
what to watch out for, so that they would not trigger the self
defense mechanism in the ruin.</p>
<p>Shortly, the three of them reached an abyss, which looked
bottomless and was about several miles wide. It almost looked like
the gates to hell. From afar, he could see a fairytale like Castle
that looked like it was designed for the giants.</p>
<p>The castle was connected to their side by a foot-long crystal
bridge. It looked like the two sides of the abscess were connected
by a thread.</p>
<p>“Passing this crystal bridge, we could then arrive at the core
of the Crystallizer royalty ruin,” Li Mingtang said, pointing at
the castle far away.</p>
<p>“Can we fly over?” Han Sen said, puzzled.</p>
<p>“Look above,” Li Mingtang pointed to the ceiling and said.</p>
<p>The couple looked above and saw gigantic green crystals were
hanging from the ceiling like chandeliers, each over 10 feet wide
and very dedicate. As gorgeous as they were, Ji Yanran became pale
after she saw them.</p>
