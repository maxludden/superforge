<p>Han Sen left the virtual training camp in a good mood. After
practicing with Xiang Fei, the Dual sword skill had significantly
improved.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a shower, all the while humming a song. When he was
done, he lay down on the bed right as his communicator rang. Taking
a look at who was calling, he saw it was Qin Xuan.</p>
<p>“Qin Xuan, it’s very late for you to be calling. I can only
assume you don’t have a boyfriend,” Han Sen joked with her.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan served the army, but the two frequently stayed in
touch. Although they no longer travelled in the same circles, Han
Sen was still used to calling her Team Qin.</p>
<p>“I often go on blind dates, it’s just that I have yet to meet
someone suitable.” Qin Xuan did not care too much for these things.
Casually, she continued, “I heard Yang Manli has been talking about
you; you’ve been doing a great job, and she was complimenting you a
good deal. I almost thought it was a Manli doppelganger.”</p>
<p>“To have Team Qin compliment me makes my deeds worth the
effort.” Han Sen laughed, but wanted to change the subject.</p>
<p>Qin Xuan recognized this. She rolled her eyes and said nothing
more about it. She blinked and then said, “Did you go to the
virtual training camp?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to tell her his virtual training camp ID, but
Qin Xuan went on and said, “Earlier, I met an elite in the virtual
training camp, and I’ve learnt a lot from him.”</p>
<p>“What kind of elite?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I presume it was a great general in the army, or even a top
surpasser. He wasn’t just a master of all the hyper geno arts - he
could even modify them to suit him,” Qin Xuan told him
excitedly.</p>
<p>Hearing her, Han Sen thought something was amiss. In a strange
tone, he said, “What was this elite’s ID?”</p>
<p>“It was ‘A Little Soldier on the Battleship’. Have you seen him
before?” Qin Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“No. Absolutely not.” Han Sen replied quickly. He was shocked,
for he did not know that Qin Xuan was Xuan Fei.</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you haven’t. There’s no need to look nervous about
it.” Qin Xuan rolled her eyes again and then said, “If you happen
to see him, sometime in the future, you should remember to ask him.
He might be able to teach you a thing or two. The well of that
person’s abilities is bottomless. I guarantee you that whatever he
teaches will be incredibly useful.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep that in mind.” Han Sen maintained his cool.</p>
<p>“What’s your ID in the training camp?” Qin Xuan asked.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I won’t be able to visit the training camp for some
time. Tell me your ID and I’ll add you the next time I am there.”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Okay - My ID is Xiang Fei.” Qin Xuan said.</p>
<p>“Xiang Fei? Well, who is the emperor?” Han Sen knew that Qin
Xuan was Xiang Fei, so he laughed.</p>
<p>“No one has yet shown they possess the right qualities to become
my emperor.” Qin Xuan pouted slightly as she said this.</p>
<p>“When I was in school, my ID was Black Fist Emperor. Do you want
to team up with me, since I am an emperor?”</p>
<p>“Sure. You come here.” Qin Xuan smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly had an unpleasant feeling. He slanted his head
and said, “Actually, perhaps not. As emperor, even I may not be
able to handle you.”</p>
<p>“You talk such rot. If I tell Ji Yanran later, I’d like to see
how you will be tortured.” Qin Xuan took a deep breath then
continued, “I was going to ask you to help me practice the sword
skill I learnt from the elite. But it’s okay if you don’t have time
to visit the virtual training camp. I’m going for a shower
now.”</p>
<p>After that, Qin Xuan hung up.</p>
<p>“This is too much of a coincidence. Xiang Fei is Team Qin?” Han
Sen licked his lips. He was wondering if she secretly knew that he
was the great elite she kept referring to. If she didn’t, what
would she look like if he told her?</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect Team Qin to miss something.” Han Sen was
thinking of a way in which he could prank her, the next time they
met. That would be sweet justice for the last time prank she had
played on him.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could think of a way, the communicator rang once
more. This time, it was Yang Manli.</p>
<p>The special security outfit of the Goddess Shelter comprised
only the two of them. They had not yet been able to find new
members, as no potential candidates wanted to go to the Goddess
Shelter. The shelter was too far away from everything else, and the
numbers that visited were too few to choose from.</p>
<p>After he answered, he saw Yang Manli dressed only in her
pyjamas. Her snow-white shoulders were exposed, as were her lovely,
snow-white legs. Han Sen complimented her by saying, “It is a
little cold, but those legs are amazing. I could play with those
beautiful legs for many years.”</p>
<p>Han Sen then felt a little strange. Yang Manli was a serious
person on most occasions, and very rarely would you see her not
wearing her military or battle outfits.</p>
<p>Why would Yang Menli change her clothes and suddenly start
talking to him in her pyjamas?</p>
<p>“Something is wrong.” Yang Manli’s face did not look well, and
her speaking was rushed.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Han Sen furrowed his eyebrows. If Yang Manli
was in such a hurry, then it must have something to do with the
Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>“Some people from outside have discovered our shelter. There are
dozens of them. I think they are the people you spoke of, out in
the ice fields.” Yang Manli said.</p>
<p>“Do you know which shelter they come from?” Han Sen looked
serious, too.</p>
<p>“Someone asked them, and they said they were from the Blackgod
Shelter. But before I could arrive, they had already left.” Yang
Manli looked worried, and then asked, “Are they going to do
something to us?”</p>
<p>“There’s a 90% chance they will attempt something. Out on the
ice fields, there aren’t many resources readily available to build
a royal shelter. They’re not likely to let the Goddess Shelter go.”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“What should we do?” The Goddess Shelter lacked the power to
withstand the attack of a major force.</p>
<p>Aside from Han Sen, there was not a single elite that possessed
100 sacred geno points who belonged to the Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing we can do. If they dare come, then let them.
You should send someone to keep an eye on the snowy mountains. If
you receive new information, don’t hesitate to contact me. If they
don’t come, then that’s fine. If they do come, then it is good that
I can confront them. I will kill any who draw near.” Han Sen said
coldly.</p>
<p>In the Blackgod Shelter, Blackgod and the manager of the
Blackgod Shelter were deep in discussion.</p>
<p>The looks on many people’s faces were ones of excitement. A
group of Blackgod’s people had ventured past the snowy mountains,
and had discovered the presence of a royal shelter that had been
claimed by humans.</p>
<p>They had also heard that inside the shelter, there existed an
evolver who possessed over 100 sacred geno points. This was
extremely good news for them.</p>
<p>“The owner of the shelter is Han Sen?” Blackgod’s eyes were cold
and frightening to see. He could not wait to rip Han Sen apart. It
was just that Han Sen was always alone and tracking him down was
difficult. It was great news to learn that they had discovered his
shelter.</p>
<p>“Boss, there is no way our information is incorrect. This
shelter must belong to Han Sen. We even asked the people in there
about Han Sen’s appearance, and they practically confirmed it for
us,” an evolver said.</p>
<p>“Good. Rally the troops - I am taking over that shelter!”
Blackgod’s eyes possessed a murderous look.</p>
