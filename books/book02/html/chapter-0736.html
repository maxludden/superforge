<p>Watching an extra large orange furball approach with haste, the
silver fox that was still perched on Han Sen’s shoulder moved
before its master could.</p>
<p>The silver fox’s hair all stood up, and a charge of silver light
began to form across its pelt. With a fierce discharge, a silver
thunderbolt struck the super creature that the short-haired lady
referred to as Little Orange.</p>
<p>“Meow! Aaargh!” The shrill shriek of the cat, and the sharp
scream of pain from the lady that mounted it, sounded at the same
time. The hair of Little Orange all stood on end following the
strike, and the hair of the short-haired lady looked as if it had
been set ablaze. Unmoving, she fell from the back of the cat.</p>
<p>Little Orange, after its shock, blazed with anger and leapt
towards Han Sen and the silver fox.</p>
<p>The silver fox did not wait a second, and it quickly dismounted
its master’s shoulder. It jumped into the air and fired more
thunderbolts while airborne. The Little Orange once again reeled
back, squealing in pain. But despite the pain it was suffering, it
was in no mood to submit and yield just yet.</p>
<p>The silver fox was its primary target, and the cat did its best
to snare the silver fox that repeatedly glided through the air,
zipping back and forth.</p>
<p>Although Little Orange’s speed was fairly impressive, it was not
enough for it to nab the silver fox. Every time the silver fox
evaded an attack, it zapped its foe.</p>
<p>The silver fox could not fly high, but it didn’t have to. It
only flew high enough that Little Orange was unable to grab it; it
was frustrating for the cat, who oh-so desired the furry felon that
outwitted it.</p>
<p>For Han Sen, it was an amusing sight. Although Little Orange was
much larger than the silver fox, they were both juvenile super
creatures. The cat looked like it had been born before the silver
fox, but somehow, it seemed to be in alliance with the short-haired
lady.</p>
<p>The short-haired lady was frozen while watching her cat get
bullied. She was quite surprised earlier, when Han Sen managed to
escape from the spirit hall without suffering harm. But now, she
was even more surprised that the little pervert’s silver fox pet
could challenge her own. And the way it attacked was more of a
fun-making tease, than anything.</p>
<p>“Birds of a feather, flock together!” The short-haired lady
shouted aloud, despite the fear that started to encroach upon her
mind.</p>
<p>When Zhou Yumei became an evolver and entered the Second God’s
Sanctuary, she never expected she would be sent to a dump like
this.</p>
<p>Not a single human populated the region, and when she first came
here, she witnessed a creature battling a spirit. That was how she
made it out of the spirit hall upon her arrival, and that was how
she also became stranded, here in no man’s land.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei was fortunate enough to meet Little Orange in the
shelter. It did not treat her like an enemy, and it was really nice
to her. The reason Zhou Yumei had managed to survive here was all
down to Little Orange, as a matter of fact, who frequently went out
to collect loot for her.</p>
<p>The flesh of the creatures it brought her was of the
sacred-blood variety, which surprised Zhou Yumei a lot.</p>
<p>After being together for a long time, the bond between Zhou
Yumei and Little Orange had become a strong one. They hunted
together often, and she was able to witness how easily Little
Orange slew such creatures.</p>
<p>But this powerful Little Orange of hers was now getting bullied
under an oppressive little fox, and she was starting to grow a
touch worried over its wellbeing.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei turned to look at Han Sen with her concerned
expression, but she was surprised to see him already walking
closer. He wore a smile, and a horny glint twinkled in his eye as
he returned her a gaze.</p>
<p>“What do you want? I’m warning you; I am a powerful evolver.
Keep your hands to yourself and do not attempt anything stupid.”
Zhou Yumei asserted a battle position as she gave Han Sen her
warning. Her proclamations of strength were untrue, however, and
the feigned tone of power she tried to force did not work. She
lacked the intimidation she desired.</p>
<p>After all, she had been easily restrained by Han Sen earlier,
and now her greatest pillar of support—her pet Little Orange—was
getting played with by the man’s pet silver fox. It couldn’t help
her at all, despite its desire, and this started to make her
panic.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you a few questions first. If your answers satiate
my curiosity, I will forget that orange furball ever tried to
attack me. Otherwise…” Before Han Sen finished his sentence, he
laughed twice with a menacing tone.</p>
<p>“Otherwise what?” Zhou Yumei’s heart was struck with a chill,
after seeing Han Sen laugh.</p>
<p>“Since there are only the two of us here, whatever transpires
between us can only be kept like so. If I am in a good mood, I will
rape you and then kill you. If I am in a bad mood, I will kill you
and then rape you. If my mood is ambivalent, then I’ll just kill
you while I rape you,” Han Sen bluffed.</p>
<p>When Zhou Yumei heard him speak those words, her skin flared
with goosebumps. She forced herself to present a cute smile and
with a voice of pleading, she begged, “Oh, Big Brother! There is no
need for you to do something like that. We are both humans, aren’t
we? And in this grand Second God’s Sanctuary, we were fortunate to
cross paths. Our encounter has to be one of fate. We should help
each other, not antagonize each other.”</p>
<p>“What is your name?” Han Sen gave Zhou Yumei a deep stare as he
asked.</p>
<p>“My name is Zhou Yumei. I hail from a poor family of minor
prominence. I worked my hardest to become an evolver, and I cannot
believe I ended up here in this place. Not a single other person
exists here, and it seems like I cannot leave. I almost died here!
Meeting you was a stroke of luck, indeed!” Zhou Yumei looked very
pitiable right now.</p>
<p>“Put away the acting talent. You are very young and powerful to
have joined the Second God’s Sanctuary; you must have maxed out
your sacred geno points to become an evolver. And you are saying
you hail from a poor family?” Han Sen spoke with disdain.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei presented an awkward smile and said, “Well, I’m
alright. I’m poorer than most rich people, but I suppose I’m a
little wealthier than most poor people.”</p>
<p>“Just be honest with me; do you think I won’t hesitate to strip
you naked and throw you into the spirit hall?” Han Sen gave her a
grim face as he told her this.</p>
<p>“Okay, Brother. I will tell you everything you wish to know,”
Zhou Yumei was spooked by Han Sen once again.</p>
<p>Han Sen was then quickly educated on who she was and the
relationship she shared with Little Orange.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei was quite something, and she was a councilman’s
child. Although there were many children in the Zhou family, not
all possessed power. But being an evolver with maxed out sacred
geno points, at such a young age, suggested she was quite powerful
amongst the members of her family.</p>
<p>Han Sen then learned all about Zhou Yumei and Little Orange’s
bond, which wasn’t all too different from his with the silver fox.
Such a thing was very rare, as creatures didn’t often come to
acknowledge humans as potential masters.</p>
<p>Little Orange was a second-generation super creature, and Han
Sen knew this by observing its energy flow. The first-generation,
its mother, must have been the creature she had witnessed battling
the spirit. Who knew what had happened there.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei then provided Han Sen with some intel about various
landmarks of the encompassing area that interested him.</p>
