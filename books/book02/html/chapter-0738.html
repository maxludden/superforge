<p>“No.” Han Sen pushed her away and went back to lie down on the
bench.</p>
<p>“Why? I can pay you!” Zhou Yumei quickly suggested.</p>
<p>“It’s because I can’t; that’s why,” Han Sen replied coldly.</p>
<p>“You…” Zhou Yumei quickly got angry, wishing she could just bite
Han Sen. But she knew she couldn’t compete with him, despite her
desire for him to escort her out of that place.</p>
<p>“Big Brother, if I offended you earlier—in any capacity—it was
because of how young and reckless I was back then. Could you find
it in your heart to forgive me?” Zhou Yumei held onto the urge to
try to strangle Han Sen. She hovered around him in a cute pose,
smiling fondly towards him as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Okay, I forgive you.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“Brilliant! Then come on, let’s go. I’ll pay you back once we’re
free from this place. When should we head out?” Zhou Yumei had been
driven slightly mad, after being here all alone for so long.</p>
<p>Humans desired and required social correspondence, and they
always lived together. She, however, had been stuck in this place
for over a year all by herself. If it wasn’t for the presence of
Little Orange, she would most likely have been driven completely
insane. Although her initial encounter with Han Sen had been a bad
one, her desire for contact with someone else—no matter who that
was—overcame her wrath. That was why she had made the decision to
stay.</p>
<p>She was afraid of being alone once more, and even if it was with
a bad person or a person she would incessantly argue with, it was
better than being alone.</p>
<p>“I told you I forgave you, didn’t I? I didn’t say I’d take you
out of this place,” Han Sen calmly told her.</p>
<p>“You… what do you want?” Zhou Yumei almost fainted in anger, and
her finger trembled as she pointed it at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I just don’t want to commit to the effort of getting
you out of here,” Han Sen told her, drinking his beverage.</p>
<p>Saving people was a good thing, but it was more often than not a
troublesome task. If he brought Zhou Yumei out with him now, the
Zhou family would most likely be made aware of the connection he
had with her.</p>
<p>If he didn’t bring Zhou Yumei, perhaps the Zhou family would
hate him for it. If Han Sen tried escorting her away, and something
was to happen to her while she was in his hands, the Zhou family
would be out for his blood, too.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Zhou family would be understanding, but with what he
had recently been embroiled in, he wanted to be more careful. He
would rather have her see him as a bad guy, than end up in
trouble.</p>
<p>If Zhou Yumei followed him, he would have liked to bring her
along. If something did happen through such a circumstance, perhaps
the Zhou family would not treat him as a foe.</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei was fuming mad, but she knew there was nothing she
could do. She couldn’t beg, fight, or do anything for him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhou Yumei’s eyes drifted to the snacks Han Sen had
brought with him. She suddenly grabbed the bag and ran. While she
ran off she said, “You drank all my beverages; this is payment for
that!”</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei quickly jumped on top of Little Orange and presented
Han Sen with an ugly face. She pulled the drinks and snacks out of
the rucksack and shouted to Han Sen, “Since you aren’t going to
make an effort to bring me away from this place, I’m going eat all
the snacks envisioning they are you!”</p>
<p>Zhou Yumei imagined the snacks were Han Sen, and so she ripped,
tore, and bit into them to release her anger.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since she last ate and drank like that.
Once her belly had been stuffed and she couldn’t eat anymore, she
went to sleep atop Little Orange.</p>
<p>When Zhou Yumei next woke up, she noticed Han Sen and the silver
fox were gone. She thought Han Sen had returned to the Alliance for
a while and would come back shortly, but after he had disappeared
for a whole day, she began to get worried.</p>
<p>Han Sen had previously asked her what points of interests there
were in the area, and she had informed him of a black mountain that
wasn’t too far off. That mountain was inhabited by a strange
Twin-Tail Purple Scorpion. It was a creature that even Little
Orange was afraid of, and was most likely a fearsome super
creature.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard of a lonely super creature out there, he had
shown a feverish desire to slay it. If it was a second-generation
super creature, that would have been the icing on the cake he very
much desired.</p>
<p>According to the directions Zhou Yumei gave him, Han Sen had to
walk one hundred miles to just about see the mountain in the
distance. The mountain did not have a sharpened peak, and was more
like a rolling mountain range. It was strange to see mountains
lined up like so, out in a place such as that.</p>
<p>Han Sen rode his Golden Growler towards the mountain, and with
the silver fox by his side, all the other creatures that inhabited
the area hid. The creatures he did see, however, were not grouped
as he expected.</p>
<p>The Black Desert was very unique in this aspect, as most of the
creatures that inhabited this place tended to be alone.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before he began his ascent of the black
mountains. He managed to detect the life force he had been
searching for and hurried his Golden Growler up the slopes.
Eventually, he laid eyes on the Twin-Tail Purple Scorpion, which he
found wandering the foothills of the mountain. It was fervently
digging into the sand.</p>
<p>There were many black rocks in the hole it dug, and it was a
trying task for it to remove them. The Twin-Tail Purple Scorpion
was one meter deep, but Han Sen could not guess what it may have
been searching for.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to observe the twin-tail scorpion’s strange
behavior for a little while longer, so he did not summon his little
angel to immediately attack the fiend. For a better view, he
climbed atop a ten meter tall boulder and then resumed watching the
scorpion digging up the rocks. He had become quite keen.</p>
<p>While watching, he opened his gene lock with the Dongxuan Sutra
to observe its energy flow and assert whether or not it was a
second-generation super creature as he had hoped it to be.</p>
<p>Han Sen was disappointed, however. The energy inside the
scorpion was all blurred, and he could not watch the energy flow
properly, which meant it was only a first-generation super
creature.</p>
<p>Since it was only a first-generation super creature, all he
could hope for by defeating it was a beast soul. The Life Geno
essences weren’t useful to him, and only fronted a monetary
value.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t want to sell too many Life Geno essences, either,
as they tended to make others jealous. The entire Alliance was
currently focusing on him like starved beggars admiring a spit
roast. Unsure of what others were thinking, Han Sen thought it was
best to maintain as low a profile as possible.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if I can get a beast soul, at least.” Han Sen stared
at the twin-tail scorpion, knowing that the chances of obtaining a
beast soul were low no matter which way it was cut. He had
calculated that, even with his own luck, the drop-rate for a beast
soul was only around fifty percent.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was still quite curious, and he was keen to learn
what the scorpion was doing. It continued to dig into the black
rocks beneath, and by now, it had dug three meters into the ground
without slowing down.</p>
<p>“Is this guy a little too thirsty, maybe? Perhaps it’s trying to
get some water?” Han Sen said this in half jest, because he knew
that super creatures did not need to eat or drink to survive.</p>
<p>Only certain special super creatures or pregnant super creatures
would occasionally eat. But even still, he had never seen them
drink water.</p>
<p>“What is it doing?” Han Sen had a strange feeling while
observing this.</p>
