<h3>Chapter 695</h3>

<p>Han Sen left the silver fox by the Beetle Knight so his
doppelganger would appear more authentic; Han Sen was planning on
traveling to Devil’s Mountain alone.</p>
<p>With the angel by his side, however, he wasn’t afraid. He wanted
to use this opportunity to slay sacred-blood creatures and max out
his sacred geno points.</p>
<p>He hunted many sacred-blood creatures in the sea, but because of
their large size, eating a lot of them was a slow process. As a
result, attempting to max out his sacred geno points this way was
far too slow.</p>
<p>Devil’s Mountain was home to many different creatures. Not long
after he began ascending the mountain, he caught sight of big
gorillas, with a few mutants among them.</p>
<p>But someone was already battling with the group of gorillas,
which surprised him. He never expected he’d find someone else so
bold as to hunt creatures on Devil’s Mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look and noticed it was Philip. He had a
girl nearby him, as he fought. The black gorillas were unable to
compete with Philip, as he quickly laid waste to each and every one
of them. Even the mutant-class variants could not withstand many
attacks from him, and he looked to be a fiercely powerful
warrior.</p>
<p>“Philip, you are so good! You are so strong and so handsome!”
The woman had her hands pressed against her chest as she praised
Philip. The pupils of her eyes were almost shaped like hearts in
adoration.</p>
<p>The woman was rather pretty. She had big boobies, long legs, and
looked quite young. Her words of encouragement were soft but
high-pitched, and they worked like fuel on Philip, stoking the fire
of his yearning to do combat. He now fought even harder. He ruled
the sword in his hand like he ruled the world.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the scene for a while but then prepared to
leave. As he walked away, he heard the woman say something else to
Philip, who had slain all the gorillas. “Philip, you are so good!
But these creatures are not your level; let’s find some
sacred-blood creatures for you to go against.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard this, it made him happy. Philip was going to
make a blunder and waltz into danger, unknowingly. They were at the
edge of Devil’s Mountain, and there were no dangerous monsters
where they currently were.</p>
<p>If Philip really did naively venture deeper with the young lady,
finding a creature wouldn’t be the issue. Re-emerging from that
horrific place, alive with all limbs still attached, would be the
problem.</p>
<p>But this had nothing to do with Han Sen, so he kept on walking.
After ascending the current ridge he was scaling, there was a
canyon before him. It was host to many shrubs and thickets of
vetiver-like plants, each crowned with a number of pink flowers.
Butterflies danced softly around them, painting it as a quaint and
idyllic place.</p>
<p>What Han Sen saw, however, was a dangerous zone. Although the
butterflies looked beautiful, they were secretly aggressive
creatures. Looks could traditionally be deceiving, and so it was,
as Han Sen could observe the powerful life forces within them. They
were no ordinary creatures, and they had to be at least
mutant-class.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the butterflies from afar. The canyon was
sprawling, painted in patches of vetiver. The butterflies were
there in a high number, all about, like flickering flames above the
ground. They were larger than average butterflies, but they still
looked weak and easily squishable.</p>
<p>“Philip, look. Someone is there!” Han Sen was still observing
the view of the canyon before him when he heard the familiar voice
ring out.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and saw Philip and his big-boobed
lady-friend approaching. He promptly frowned.</p>
<p>Philip was one of the leaders of the ice fields, in charge of
the Philip Shelter. He wasn’t a dumb, foolhardy man, and Han Sen
was surprised at his willingness to bring a lady up Devil’s
Mountain.</p>
<p>Philip did not see him as Han Sen, due to Han Sen being clad in
golden armor.</p>
<p>“What is your name, my friend?” Philip asked, while looking him
over.</p>
<p>The golden armor was not exclusive to Dollar, as many people
possessed it in the Second God’s Sanctuary. It was because of this
that Philip wasn’t quick to assume Han Sen was anyone particularly
special, least of all Dollar.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen did not answer Philip’s question, he
merely replied with another.</p>
<p>“If you want to traverse this perilous mountain, perhaps we
should team up? We can watch each other’s backs,” Philip said.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I prefer traveling alone,” Han Sen coldly
responded.</p>
<p>When the lady heard him say this, she didn’t look as happy as
she once did. She blurted out, “You are so ungrateful! Philip is a
cornerstone of the union here; he is owner of one of the Goddess
Shelter’s armies! He is Philip, as in the Philip Army? He wanted to
help you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but no thank you. I have a personal obligation to
fulfill; perhaps our paths will cross again soon.” Han Sen wasn’t
interested in accompanying Philip, in the presence of his girl.</p>
<p>“This man does not know his place; ignore him. Let’s go!” The
woman, who was clutching Philip’s arm, tugged strongly. Then they
both departed for the valley.</p>
<p>Philip felt tremendously awkward, but with a righteous face he
said to the lady, “Xiao Yuan, Devil’s Mountain is far too
dangerous. If we venture there alone, I can only fear a wretched
happening might befall us. Give me a second and I’ll see if I can
convince him.”</p>
<p>Philip pulled away from her as he pleaded his plight. He snuck
near Han Sen and whispered, “Friend, our encounter here is fate.
Why can we not go together?”</p>
<p>After that, Philip lowered his voice even further, to a point
where even Han Sen almost had trouble hearing, and said, “Friend,
do me a favor here. I’ll give you two mutant beast souls.”</p>
<p>“What favor?” Han Sen enquired.</p>
<p>“Pretend you and I argue, then we feign a fight. Throw the fight
and then pretend to be terrified, running away as I chase you from
behind. That’s all you need to do. One mutant beast soul now and
another you can come claim at the Philip Shelter. You must have
heard of the name Philip before, yes? Then you know a man of such
reputation would not fail to fulfill their debt.” Philip was again
speaking in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“Give me two sacred-blood beast souls and I’ll think about it.”
Han Sen understood what Philip truly wanted. As much as he would
have liked to impress his girl, he couldn’t avoid venturing any
further into Devil’s Mountain without offending her.</p>
<p>“Friend, that is daylight robbery! I only asked you to put on a
show; two mutant beast souls is a generous offer for such a deed,”
Philip said, with a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>“Ordinarily, yes; it isn’t too bad an offer. But I have
something quite important to do today. Time is precious for me
right now, so the price is two sacred-blood beast souls,” Han Sen
responded.</p>
<p>“Brother, two sacred-blood beast souls is too much.” Philip
continued to frown.</p>
<p>“That’s okay; I have an alternate way for you to get what you
need, a method that requires no effort on your behalf.” Han Sen
smiled.</p>
<p>“What method would that be?” Philip gave Han Sen a confused
look.</p>
<p>“It’s simple.” When Han Sen spoke, he moved. A gold shadow
flashed in front of the lady. The woman was suddenly shocked, and
she looked ready to scream, but before she could, Han Sen slapped
the back of her neck and she fainted.</p>
<p>“There you go! See? That’ll cost you nothing. Now you can go
pretend that you saved her.” Han Sen handed Philip the unconscious
woman and then left him, venturing on to the canyon.</p>
<p>“Friend, you can’t leave. You are in trouble!” When Philip
picked up the unconscious woman, his face changed.</p>
