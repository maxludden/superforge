<p>“Brother Han, I have already told you everything. Fix me,
quick!” Chen Ran begged.</p>
<p>“Old Chen, I really would like to fix you and set you free. But
in addition to not telling me the truth, you are trying to kill
me.” Han Sen looked at Chen Ran sighed.</p>
<p>Chen Ran’s faced changed and he said, “Brother Han, why would
you say something like that? I am telling you the truth; there is
no lie. And for me to be in such a position, how could I possible
try to kill you?”</p>
<p>“After the entrance, I am supposed to go up nine tiers, not
down,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>Chen Ran’s face changed, but he still insisted that he had told
the truth. “How come? I have always learnt by going down nine
tiers, ever since I was a kid.”</p>
<p>“After the jade door, I should go left and then head up. The
defense ballad should be three, not nine. Should I go on?” Han Sen
squinted his eyes while looking at Chen Ran.</p>
<p>“Impossible. Impossible! Did that Zhu Ting… no… Zhu Ting
shouldn’t know the real Seven Twists… you… you…” Chen Ran’s face
looked at Han Sen as if he had just seen a ghost.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people in the Chen family who knew how to
perform Seven Twists. Those that did were afraid of outsiders
learning the skill. That was why most students were only taught
Three Twists instead of the original, complete variant.</p>
<p>In addition to Three Twists, they were also given false,
filler-skills to change core components of the art. Even a
master-class person, had they not seen Seven Twists performed in
its entirety, would not be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>If people were being taught the fake Seven Twists, the
differences were so minor they’d believe it was indeed the real
thing.</p>
<p>But if you continued to practice it, you could become mildly
paralyzed, and in extreme cases, end up dead.</p>
<p>Chen Ran could not understand how Han Sen already knew the real
Seven Twists.</p>
<p>“I have given you far more chances than you are worthy of, but
still, you haven’t said an honest word to me.” Han Sen raised his
peacock crossbow and took aim at Chen Ran.</p>
<p>“No… don’t kill me… I can’t die… I can’t die…”</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Chen Ran’s eyes opened with a look of utter despair cast across
his face. A bolt had blown a hole through his head.</p>
<p>“People like you, enemies of mine; I don’t feel safe leaving you
alive.” Han Sen returned his peacock crossbow. He didn’t want to
let Chen Ran go in the first place.</p>
<p>Han Sen burnt Chen Ran’s corpse as he initially planned to,
retrieved his bolts, and continued his journey back to the
Icefield.</p>
<p>Although he already had Seven Twists, he would need Heavenly Go
as a base. Otherwise, he’d have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had stolen Heavenly Go from Queen, he’d have to
learn it in its entirety from the source Qi Gong. And that would
take a long time.</p>
<p>Han Sen was already in the midst of learning Dongxuan Sutra and
Jadeskin, so he didn’t really have enough time to spare to practice
another Qi Gong.</p>
<p>“I wonder if I can use the Dongxuan Sutra to replace Heavenly
Go? After all, certain techniques of the Dongxuan Sutra aren’t all
that different to Heavenly Go. But I’m not sure if the Dongxuan
Sutra can wholly replace Heavenly Go.” Under the silver fox’s
protection, Han Sen’s journey was almost too tame. That was why,
with his thoughts free, he wondered if he could use Dongxuan Sutra
for the base of Seven Twists.</p>
<p>The results of his attempts were better than he thought. Han Sen
had noticed, ever since he stole Heavenly Go from Queen, he could
use Dongxuan Sutra to simulate the skill. He could even simulate
Seven Twists.</p>
<p>But that did not mean Han Sen had really learnt Heavenly Go and
Seven Twists in their original form; he was just simulating them
through the Dongxuan Sutra. And that still meant he was, at his
core, using Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>But for Han Sen, that was already enough.</p>
<p>When Heavenly Go and Seven Twists were combined together, Han
Sen was able to fathom the terrible power such a combination could
yield.</p>
<p>The original Seven Twists included, as the title suggested,
seven airborne twists. But combined with Heavenly Go, the move
wasn’t quite so simple.</p>
<p>With both of these together, he would not need wings to soar the
skies in flight. And this was something only a handful of
surpassers were capable of.</p>
<p>He could do it straight away if he combined Heavenly Go and
Seven Twists, but he’d need enough energy. Provided he had enough,
he could fly through the air as free as a bird.</p>
<p>Seven Twists would no longer be borrowing the strength of the
air seven times, it’d be far more.</p>
<p>Chen Ran said you could fly for thousands of miles, but that was
clearly an exaggeration. For airborne battles, however, it was
something that would prove incredibly useful.</p>
<p>But flying required a lot of fitness and a lot of energy. Han
Sen hated the fact that his Dongxuan Sutra’s progress was so slow,
and he had no idea when he could unlock its first gene lock.</p>
<p>He could use Dongxuan Sutra to simulate the Aero flying skill,
but it would only last fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>But even that was a scary thing, because it was entirely
different than using a beast soul. This was the true power of
flight, and it would allow for the complete freedom of his body to
do what it wished, just as efficiently as it could on the
ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so excited at the prospect, he continued to practice
it on his way.</p>
<p>Heavenly Go’s formation was flat, but combined with Seven
Twists, it became a three-dimensional formation with increased
power. While this was quite the boon, it also required a user
powerful enough to use it.</p>
<p>With the silver fox protecting him on his way, and the map he
had received from Huangfu Pingqing, Han Sen arrived on the other
side of the Devil’s Mountain safely.</p>
<p>This whole area belonged to a man called Lu Hui. Han Sen had
heard that this man was the Captain of the Blueblood Special Force
and the Blueblood Reserve Force. To become such a captain meant he
had to be quite a special person.</p>
<p>There were three royal shelters that were all under the control
of Lu Hui. He was the boss of this area, and even though there
existed another boss to the north, no one could dare to challenge
him here. This was his domain.</p>
<p>Han Sen once asked around about Lu Hui’s power, and the answers
he received were quite shocking. Every one of Lu Hui’s men were
incredibly strong, far stronger than an average soldier of the
Icefield.</p>
<p>Han Sen was lucky to have the Devil’s Mountain separating his
domain from Lu Hui’s. Otherwise, defending the Icefield from either
Lu Hui or the northern boss would be a near-futile endeavor.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the path Thunder Devil once took, and it wasn’t
long before he caught sight of a giant floating island in the skies
above the Icefield.</p>
<p>There were many flying creatures soaring to and fro around the
mystery island, as if they were devils searching for their next
hapless victims.</p>
