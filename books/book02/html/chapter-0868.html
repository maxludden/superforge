<p>“Die?” Han Sen looked at the woman with shock.</p>
<p>“Follow me.” The woman gestured for Han Sen and Zero to
accompany her, then she turned around and ventured deeper into the
forest.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Zero looked at each other, then decided to go with
her. They hadn’t been walking too long when they came to a clearing
with a few tents and other living amenities. There were a few other
people there too, sunbathing in the pleasant afternoon
sunshine.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Zero’s arrival roused their attention. Those who
were lying down stood up, and others came out from their tents.</p>
<p>There were a dozen humans there, and judging from their apparel
and the state of their tents, they must have been there for quite
some time.</p>
<p>“It is lucky I found you. If I hadn’t, you’d be dead right now,
with no clue as to how your death had come about.” Back in the
camp, the woman seemed to be a touch calmer. “This place is safe,
so pitch a tent and rest a while.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the woman and said, “Why? What’s going
on?”</p>
<p>“You guys know this is the Dark Haunted Forest, don’t you?” she
asked, with shock. The others in the camp eyed Han Sen and his
fellows curiously.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and said, “I have traveled a great
distance. I didn’t suspect this forest to have any form of
notoriety.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you poor and unfortunate people. Most people who wander
into this forest at unawares can never find a way out.” The woman
let out a lamenting sigh.</p>
<p>“Never find a way out?” Han Sen was shocked at hearing what the
woman told him. He did not believe a forest could trap him and
prevent his leaving.</p>
<p>If he could not walk out, he could at least fly. Regardless of
how creepy this place was, it would be impossible for a forest to
trap a creature with wings.</p>
<p>“You really have no idea what you’ve stumbled into, do you? You
both look young, and for you both to enter this place and subject
yourself to this fate is a crying shame, I tell you. A crying
shame!” Another person in camp had become quite outspoken.</p>
<p>“Can someone cut the nonsense and tell it to me straight? What
is going on here?” Han Sen passed out some alcohol and food to the
people, retrieved from the satchels on Golden Growler.</p>
<p>When the people saw the alcohol and food, they looked shocked.
They ran over to the items and devoured them as quickly as they
could, as if they hadn’t eaten in a thousand years.</p>
<p>“Brother, do you have cigarettes?” a middle-aged man asked Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes, as a matter of fact. I do.” Han Sen pulled out a pack of
cigarettes from his pocket and tossed them over to the middle-aged
man, who looked to be in absolute shock.</p>
<p>“You should put these away and cherish them. You’re going to be
here for a long time.” When the woman saw how generous Han Sen was
being, she couldn’t help but present a wry smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood what she was implying, but he did not believe
he’d be trapped in the forest as they had been. He smiled and asked
for the people there to tell him all they could about the
place.</p>
<p>The people there were harmless, and after receiving the goods
from Han Sen, they passionately relayed as many of the tales and
stories about the place as they could.</p>
<p>Like Han Sen, they had mistakenly ventured into the Dark Haunted
Forest. They hadn’t come together, but one at a time. Whatever
venture led them to the forest had been their last, and they had
all been stuck there ever since.</p>
<p>The woman who invited them over, near the big tree, was the most
recent addition to the growing community. Her name was Liu Fang,
and she had gotten lost in the forest two years before Han Sen’s
arrival.</p>
<p>Liu Fang was a botanist. Her job in the Alliance was associated
with the forest, and she had a great interest in the Dark Haunted
Trees that grew there.</p>
<p>She went there wanting to learn more about them, but walking a
mere ten meters into the forest to collect a sample was enough to
prevent her from leaving. She couldn’t escape and suddenly, the
forest stretched out for miles around in every direction. After a
while of traveling, she too stumbled across this camp.</p>
<p>The others had a similar fate befall them. Some entered by
mistake, whereas others entered the forest in pursuit of adventure.
Everyone who hadn’t somehow ended up dead, found themselves at this
camp.</p>
<p>“What is so dangerous about this place? Those fireflies are
harmless, aren’t they?” Han Sen felt compelled to ask.</p>
<p>Liu Fang, with another wry smile, responded, “The Dark Haunted
Forest is not aggressive in itself. The real danger comes from the
Dark Haunted Trees.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying those trees are a danger?” Han Sen eyed the
trees that were all about, and didn’t notice anything particularly
dangerous.</p>
<p>“We were wondering if the trees were creatures, and the bugs
were merely an extension of their bodies.” Liu Fang paused after
saying this, and then continued, “You probably haven’t noticed this
yet, but if you stay near the trees for a while, you will age much
faster. In three months, you can die from old age!”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“You are lucky that Little Fang brought you here. If you walk
within a kilometer of that big tree, you can die in less than three
hours. It’s a crying shame!” the man called Wang Jiangang said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, if that’s the case.” Han Sen appreciated what she
did for him. He might have been indestructible when going up
against physical threats in the Second God’s Sanctuary now, but
there was no guarantee of survival against such creepy works.</p>
<p>Had he not been informed of the danger, he would have continued
to blindly walk into the tree’s entrapment.</p>
<p>“You are welcome.” Liu Fang, after another wry smile, continued
her dialogue. “I came here with two friends. They stayed in
proximity to the Dark Haunted Tree King for one hour, and after
that, they looked to be about two hundred years old. Then, they
died of old age. Just remember; do not get close to the Tree
King—it’ll affect your body quite quickly.”</p>
<p>“If it is not necessary, do not even venture beyond the
outskirts of this camp. It’ll be a crying shame, if you do. These
ordinary trees can still affect you, it is just difficult for you
to tell,” Wang Jiangang said.</p>
<p>“Can’t I just fly away?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You can’t. This forest is endless, and whether you try to
escape by foot or by wings, you cannot leave. It’s a crying shame.”
Wang Jiangang smiled wryly, and continued to say, “I came to this
place with beast soul wings myself. If these wings could deliver me
to safety, I wouldn’t still be here!”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and asked, “Have you tried cutting down the Dark
Haunted Trees?”</p>
<p>Liu Fang answered, “You can’t do that, either. If you cut them,
they release a gas of some sort. It makes you grow older even
faster. The camp in this meadow is the only place that is free from
those wretched trees. And what’s more, even if you do unearth the
tree and destroy its roots, it’ll magically restore itself within a
few days.”</p>
