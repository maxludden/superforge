<p>“Han Sen, you rock! How did you do that? You dealt Dong Lin a
significant blow.” In the communicator, Tang Zhenliu was staring at
Han Sen in awe.</p>
<p>That person in Dong Lin looked for Tang’s family, desiring
reconciliation with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“That money is for his son’s life.” Han Sen looked at Tang
Zhenliu’s list and smiled.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? You made a move on his son?” Tang Zhenliu
looked at Han Sen with an expression of surprise.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything to his son; he came after me.” Han Sen
told Tang Zhenliu the tale of what had occurred in the royal
shelter.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me you killed an evolver who had unlocked their
first gene lock? You have opened a gene lock too, then, I presume?”
Tang Zhenliu’s eyes were wide, looking at his correspondent’s face
with much admiration.</p>
<p>“I’m not that fast; it was just luck. I have a kick-ass pet, and
it was my pet that killed Thunderdevil,” Han Sen told him,
smiling.</p>
<p>“What sort of pet can be that powerful? If you’ve got any more
for sale, I’ll take ten!” Tang Zhenliu jested with a hearty
laugh.</p>
<p>“I only have one. I can only surmise that Lady Luck is fond of
me, when bestowing the fortune to receive such pet. You can’t envy
me!” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder why he was willing to pay you that much. An
evolver with an unlocked gene lock was killed by you? Nothing could
stand in your way of killing Qi Xiuwen, if that is what you chose
to do,” Tang Zhenliu said.</p>
<p>“Of course, but I’m not that stupid. I’m not willing to kill
people of small concern, like him. There’d be no benefit, and if
anything, it’d just be a hassle. Retaliation from Dong Lin would
likely occur, as well. I don’t even have that many troops at my
command, either. I need to make use of his men to take care of the
royal shelter for a while, while my own army expands. Qi Xiuwen is
now a puppet on strings, so I have no fear of any more betrayal. He
and his troops will do things honestly and earnestly
henceforth.”</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to peruse the list while he told Tang Zhen Li,
“I suppose I agree with the compensation they are offering. But I
don’t want these random items or their money. Help me talk to the
people in Dong Lin and have it all swapped for Geno Creation
pills.”</p>
<p>“If those things don’t work correctly, they can kill someone.
What do you need that many for?” Tang Zhen Li enquired,
frowning.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what Tang Zhenliu was thinking, so he smiled. He
said, “Don’t worry, I’m not using this stuff to harm anyone. I know
how to use them, but anyway, help me talk to them to get this
exchange in motion.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll get in touch with them. I’ll let you know in a few
days, most likely.” After a while, Tang Zhenliu still wanted to ask
once more, “Did your pet really kill Thunderdevil?”</p>
<p>“There were many people there, and they can be found all across
the Icefields. If you honestly don’t believe me, why don’t you ask
them? I barely lifted a finger.” Han Sen spread his hands as he
reasserted what had happened.</p>
<p>“Damn! Your luck really does make others jealous. To be able to
kill a man who has unlocked their first gene lock, that pet must be
way too OP. Why can’t I ever be the recipient of such fortune?”
Tang Zhenliu’s face was one of almost anguish, in the envy he had
for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Turning off the communicator, Han Sen went to the royal
shelter.</p>
<p>The Geno Creation pills from Dong Lin were not the type of goods
that could be purchased in the markets. This was because the
Alliance forbid them to be sold. If Han Sen wanted to buy some,
there was nowhere he could go to do so. Even if he could obtain
them through the more illicit routes of trade, they’d cost an arm
and a leg. So, getting them directly from the Qi family was
undoubtedly the best way to go about their retrieval right now.</p>
<p>If the silver fox wanted to eat them so much, perhaps they could
provide some major benefits? There would be no harm in having a few
more at his disposal, anyway.</p>
<p>If they turned out to provide the boon he was hoping for, Han
Sen thought Qi Xiuwen could stay wrapped around his finger for a
while longer. If he ever wanted more, he could go through Qi Xiuwen
for them at the family discount.</p>
<p>“Boss, the silver beetles outside the gate remain. They are not
pulling away. We tried killing a few, and we were successful, but
it’s as if they can respawn in an instant! How should we deal with
them?” Philip saw Han Sen pass by and made sure to voice his
concern over their unwelcome squatters.</p>
<p>This Philip was quite something. The reason he was called Philip
was because of his gluttonous appetite for fillet steaks.</p>
<p>Li Xinglun once said that Philip’s family was rather extensive,
and he himself was quite talented. If he wasn’t, he couldn’t be a
faction leader in the fragmented Icefields, after all.</p>
<p>“I will handle this. You guys don’t need to do anything.” Han
Sen then went to look for Zero, and with her and the silver fox in
tow, exited the shelter via the main gate.</p>
<p>The evolvers out on the road would always allow Han Sen to pass,
and many would greet him as courteously as they could. They’d also
make sure to pay their respects to the silver fox.</p>
<p>“That is the pet that killed the guy with an unlocked gene
lock.”</p>
<p>“It looks so… ordinary. Who would have thought it possessed so
much power?”</p>
<p>“Aww, it’s so cute! I really want one.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the silver fox when he passed through the
gate, but when he approached the ladybugs, they did not disappear
underground. There was a dizzying amount of them, squirming and
shimmering like a lake of molten silver.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen drew nearer, the presence of the silver fox
eventually came to their attention. When it did, some ran away,
whereas others burrowed underground as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>These silver beetles were very strange. You wouldn’t receive an
announcement when you killed one, there was no way to obtain a
beast soul from them, and their carcasses simply decomposed without
providing any meat for consumption.</p>
<p>It was the vast number of them that was most curious, though. It
would seem no matter how many you killed, they’d always come
back.</p>
<p>Han Sen held the silver fox and ran around the area in a loop.
Wherever he went, the silver beetles would disappear, but whenever
he left and later returned, they’d be back.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned Princess Yin’s spirit, bringing her pretty
shadow to life in front of him. He pointed towards the silver
beetles and asked, “What’s the deal with these silver beetles?”</p>
<p>Princess Yin moved her pretty eyes and said, “They are not
exactly ‘creatures.’”</p>
<p>“Well, if they are not creatures… what are they?” Han Sen
frowned as he enquired. After all, how could the creatures inside
the shelters not be creatures?</p>
<p>“They would best be described as ‘weapons,’” Princess Yin
said.</p>
<p>“Give me the details.” Han Sen was quite curious about this
revelation, so he pressed further.</p>
<p>Princess Yin then explained, “There is a Silver Beetle Mother
somewhere underground, and she can constantly reproduce the smaller
bugs that you see here. But they’re not offspring or babies in the
traditional sense, they’re more like weapons.”</p>
<p>Han Sen now understood why killing them was so useless; the
actual creature they sought resided underground!</p>
<p>“Is the Silver Beetle Mother a sacred-blood creature?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Princess Yin confirmed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around, and said while furrowing his brow, “Where
can she be found?”</p>
<p>“I am unable to control it, as I once could. Therefore, I do not
know. As a rough approximation of their burrowed depths, they
usually live around five hundred meters underground.”</p>
<p>“Five hundred meters?!” Han Sen’s eyebrows went even tighter.
There was no way he would be able to drill five hundred meters
underground to fight a sacred-blood Silver Beetle Mother.</p>
<p>But if he did not kill it, it would cost a lot of resources to
have people remove their presence, day-in, day-out. And Han Sen
would be the one paying the most; therefore, he did not want
that.</p>
<p>“It is not difficult to kill the Silver Beetle Mother. In fact,
if I had my sister, we could do it together ourselves,” Yin
fluttered her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>“This is awesome.” Han Sen did not think twice and immediately
summoned Princess Yang.</p>
<p>The beautiful twins, one with silver hair and the other with
gold hair, appeared in front of him. Han Sen could not help but
gulp as he witnessed their presence before him, side-by-side. It
was a gorgeous sight to behold.</p>
