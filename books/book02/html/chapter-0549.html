<p>Going to the Goddess Shelter, Blackgod brought with him six
evolvers, each possessing over 100 sacred geno points. He also
brought with him over 200 elite evolvers from the Blackgod
Shelter.</p>
<p>Following their investigation of the powers of the Goddess
Shelter, they surmised that their forces were more than ten times
the amount needed to wipe out the Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>Blackgod and the troops traversed a safe trail that had been
marked and signposted, to avoid the dangerous regions of the
mountains. They travelled all night to get to the Goddess
Shelter.</p>
<p>Crossing the length of the mountain range, Blackgod and his
people were finally able to see the big white castle atop a
snow-capped peak. It looked as if it had been taken straight out of
a fairy-tale.</p>
<p>“It is a royal shelter.” Blackgod said sternly, as he marched
his people towards it.</p>
<p>Their army was closing in fast. It had been no small feat for
Blackgod to uncover the fact that Han Sen owned the Goddess
Shelter. There weren’t many skilful people there, and its location
atop a mountain was sure to make things easier for Blackgod and his
army. He wasn’t going to grant Han Sen a moment’s reprieve.</p>
<p>However, he was still concerned about the possibility that Han
Sen could end up requesting the aid of Li Xing Lun, who would
happily bring his own men to bolster the defenses of the Goddess
Shelter.</p>
<p>Although someone did return to say that Han Sen was the evolver
with over a 100 sacred geno points in the Goddess Shelter, they
added that as far as they were aware, there were no other elites
present. But Blackgod was still afraid of Han Sen’s abilities,
which was why he had brought with him six evolvers with 100 sacred
geno points each and an additional 200 elite troops. He was
ravenously keen to crush the Goddess Shelter. If Han Sen was
present, also, then he’d kill him without a second thought.</p>
<p>Blackgod wanted to make his trip there as short as possible,
knowing that Han Sen may have already guessed he was on his way.
That was fine, however. Even if he was aware of what was about to
happen, he wouldn’t have the power to resist and fight back.
Blackgod wanted nothing more than to crush Han Sen’s Goddess
Shelter, as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>Han Sen woke up and received word from Yang Manli of what was
going on. In no time at all, he had teleported himself to the
Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, he did nothing. All he did was wait for
Blackgod to show himself. He knew him well enough by now to know
that he wasn’t going to let this opportunity pass him by.</p>
<p>The whole Goddess Shelter was on high alert, primed for the
battle that was to come. Troops from the Goddess Army had manned
the ramparts, while ordinary citizens and various merchants watched
from afar, with bated breath.</p>
<p>No matter how slow they were, they could sense something major
was going to happen in the Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>As Han Sen reached the gate’s tower, Blackgod and his troops had
at last arrived at the empty field of the mountain, the one that
stretched out before the walls of the Goddess Shelter.</p>
<p>Over two hundred of the Blackgod’s elite were mounted atop snow
wolves, and were lined up in formation. The six evolvers Blackgod
had brought with him spearheaded the formation. They too rode
beasts, and the eyes of everyone on that field were now fixed upon
the Goddess Shelter ahead of them.</p>
<p>“Where did all these people come from? Is there another shelter
nearby?”</p>
<p>“Of course there is. Our Goddess Shelter does not possess that
many elites. Take a look at the 200 hundred snow wolves out there.
Even if we managed to sell everything in the Goddess Shelter, there
would be no way for us to purchase such a vast amount.”</p>
<p>“Look at the formation they are in. It seems as if they are
going to attack our shelter.”</p>
<p>“Things might be better if they took over our shelter. Han Sen
is quite the tax collector; perhaps the new management wouldn’t rob
us of so much money.”</p>
<p>“Look at that formation - just look at it. There is no way Han
Sen can take on a force like that. Do you think he’ll end up
surrendering?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The commoners of the Goddess Shelter were in heated discussion
about the events currently unfolding.</p>
<p>Blackgod was riding a unicorn black wolf. Its eyes glistened
with a striking iciness. The beast took two steps forward, and
Blackgod unsheathed a black long-sword. He raised it towards the
sight of Han Sen, who was standing on the tower above the gate of
the city. He then said aloud, “I am the Blackgod army’s leader,
Blackgod! Han Sen is both a shameless and obscene person. He
sneak-attacked me with a brutal poison, and I almost died. Today, I
have come to put an end to the grudge I harbor against this
horrible man. This is between me and him. If the rest of you lay
down your arms, I will grant you your lives. Those who aid Han Sen
and try to stop me exacting my revenge will be mercilessly
slain.”</p>
<p>After the speech, Blackgod rattled the longsword in his hand and
cut in half a glacier that was in front of him. The strength of
such a strike struck fear into the hearts of those in the Goddess
Shelter.</p>
<p>“Kill!”</p>
<p>The 200 evolvers behind Blackgod screamed this word together. So
loud was it, it was though the sky had been torn asunder by a
savage clap of thunder.</p>
<p>“He is too strong! Blackgod is an elite with over 100 sacred
geno points, and the people behind him are powerful evolvers. With
just the miniscule forces of the Goddess Shelter, how can we hope
to beat them?”</p>
<p>“He had it coming! People like Han Sen should have died a long
time ago.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he did have it coming. Han Sen doesn’t know his place, and
what he has done recently has been too much. He sneak-attacked
someone with poison? Now that those people are after him, he’s a
dead man walking. Their lust for his blood is total.”</p>
<p>“Will he flee back to the Alliance?”</p>
<p>“I can’t see him getting out of this predicament in any other
way.”</p>
<p>“Did you see the six other people behind Blackgod? They all
looked like tigers and wolves. Frighteningly powerful! Maybe they
are evolvers that are over 100 too? The soldiers Han Sen has at his
command most likely can’t even repel the advance of one. And that
Blackgod fellow has six of them. Six!”</p>
<p>“It’s good that Han Sen is on his way out. The amount of money
he takes from us each month is ridiculous. He deserves what’s
coming to him!”</p>
<p>The people talking were those who had joined the Goddess Army
but later quit. They did not want to complete with their service,
instead just wanting to reap the welfare. When Han Sen took over
the Goddess Shelter, he had treated those in the Goddess Army with
far greater care. But for these who complained, he made sure to
collect their rent, taxes and entry fees. As a result, they
disliked Han Sen and wanted to see him suffer great misfortune.</p>
<p>It never crossed their mind that if Han Sen had not taken over
the Goddess Shelter, their lives would likely be a lot worse.</p>
<p>But this is what humanity is like. No matter how well you treat
someone, doing one thing that goes against their ideals is
something they will remember. They will rarely remember the
good.</p>
<p>The merchants of the Goddess Shelter were perturbed. They did
not care who the current owner of the Goddess Shelter was, they
only wanted to know that if the place was to see another exchange
of ownership, whether the taxes would be higher or lower.</p>
<p>The Goddess Army’s solders were all pale. Some elites were able
to tell that Blackgod’s elites were really powerful, and thought
that their attempt to defend the Goddess Shelter would likely be
futile.</p>
<p>“Boss, should we retreat?” Uncle Qing furrowed his brow. The
power on display from Blackgod was clearly far beyond what the
Goddess Shelter could repel.</p>
<p>“No. You guys stay here.” Han Sen said calmly. He stared at
Blackgod and his army of 200 evolvers.</p>
<p>Han Sen leapt from the gate’s tower and landed on the field
before the gate. Alone, he ventured towards Blackgod.</p>
<p>Blackgod raised his hand and signaled for the army to stay put.
He sternly watched Han Sen approach, and smiled.</p>
<p>“What is Han Sen going over there for, all alone?”</p>
<p>“Idiot. But oh well, what else can he do? It looks like he is
surrendering already. The gulf in power cannot be bridged. He can’t
fight.”</p>
<p>“Tee-hee. Han Sen, who has been so cocky all this time, is
finally getting what’s coming to him.”</p>
<p>“He deserves it.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most people did think that the gap in power between the
two forces was too large, and that Han Sen was going out there to
surrender.</p>
