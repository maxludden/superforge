<p>“Huh, this Dancer is pretty good. He’s put Dollar in a pretty
bad position.” Tang Zhenliu managed to secure a seat in the
audience and watched the fight carefully.</p>
<p>“His Mechanical Fist is fairly remarkable. He could be at an
expert level of close-distance fighting. Very well done!” Lin Feng,
who was also there watching, said.</p>
<p>“Is it really that powerful?” Tang Zhenliu enquired
inquisitively.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s okay. It can indeed be quite troubling if it gets
close to you,” Lin Feng smiled and said.</p>
<p>“If you say it can be troubling at such a close distance, then
it must be powerful! I wonder how Dollar will get out of this
predicament? Surely, he cannot just keep dodging like that.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Lin Feng and Tang Zhenliu who had come to watch,
but many others had arrived there in droves to watch the fight.</p>
<p>Yi Dongmu was in the Alliance currently, and hearing about the
fight with Dollar, made sure to come and watch. He was sitting in
the stands and didn’t blink once as he watched the battle
unfold.</p>
<p>Qian Hezhen and a few people from the Ares Martial Hall had also
come to watch the fight, because people were whispering that Dollar
was going to make use of Heavenly Go. Heavenly Go was a secret
skill of the Ares Martial Hall. Very few trainees of the Ares
Martial Hall would ever learn that skill, so it was only natural
for them to desire to see it in action.</p>
<p>Qian Hezhen invited the Queen to come and watch, but she lacked
interest in such events and decline the invitation.</p>
<p>Aside from those figures of prestige, many elite evolvers had
come to watch the fight, eager to see and learn to what extend
Dollar might use his skills and powers. Like the others, they were
also interested in finding out whether what he used was Heavenly Go
or not.</p>
<p>Ever since Kill Dollar last fought in the arena, a lot of people
had come to believe that he was a member of the Ares Martial Hall.
After all, if he wasn’t, how did he come to possess the skill
Heavenly Go?</p>
<p>Dancer’s flurry of attacks were still coming on strong. In the
beginning, people were shocked by the ferocity of his raging
assault, but slowly, they came to realize that Dancer did not have
as much of an advantage as they initially thought. Bit by bit,
Dancer was being pushed into a corner.</p>
<p>“How could this happen? Dollar was only dodging. How come it is
Dancer who has been pushed into a corner?”</p>
<p>“Dollar is Dollar. Even without attacking he can reign supreme;
he is too damn strong!”</p>
<p>“This is amazing.”</p>
<p>The ordinary folk were shocked by how powerful Dollar was, but
the elites had a strange look upon them.</p>
<p>“This is the real Heavenly Go, right?” Tang Zhenliu pondered
with surprise, turning to look upon Lin Feng.</p>
<p>“It looks like it.” Lin Feng spoke briefly and ended with a
nod.</p>
<p>“Heavenly Go? Is Dollar really from the Ares Martial Hall?” Yi
Dongmu furrowed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Qian Hezhen and many others had their eyes wide open. The
excellent blocking abilities that Dollar possessed where indeed
similar to the Queen’s Heavenly Go.</p>
<p>But they knew it was impossible for Dollar to be a person of the
Ares Martial Hall. The only evolver in the Ares Martial Hall was
the Queen.</p>
<p>“Damn, just who is this guy?” Qian Hezhen was looking
frustrated. He suspected that Dollar was doing this to deliberately
throw mud at the Ares Martial Hall.</p>
<p>Dancer was feeling terrible inside. He had been attacking all
this time and yet he was unable to land a single punch or even
brush his clothing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that, either; Dancer had come to realize that the
space in which he could move around was getting smaller and
smaller. The powerful attacks he had were getting harder to perform
as a result.</p>
<p>Intimidation.</p>
<p>Dancer was feeling intimidated. Although the opponent did not
attack, the way he was dodging was forcing Dancer to alter his
position. This made him think a lot more.</p>
<p>“No. If I keep attacking here, all he has to do is reach out his
hand and…” Dancer was getting scared. The way the opponent moved
was quite threatening, and this was his weak point. Dollar was
forcing him to change his skill.</p>
<p>The people who were watching could observe this strange scene.
Dancer was attacking while Dollar kept on dodging, without fighting
back. As time went by, Dancer was getting more and more spooked.
His attacks were getting sloppier, and they were sometimes cut in
half in order for him to hastily reposition. The ordinary people
who were watching thought it looked weird, having no idea what
Dancer was doing.</p>
<p>The real elites were able to tell what was so scary about
Dollar. They really thought Dollar was using Heavenly Go, because
no other skill could induce such an effect.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>In the end, Dancer had nowhere else to go and his back was now
against the wall of the arena. He no longer cared much to
attack.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Dollar threw a punch to attack Dancer’s weak spot, killing him
outright.</p>
<p>“That was too strong! He killed him in a punch; Dollar really is
Dollar.”</p>
<p>“The Dollar is real.”</p>
<p>“The level gap was too far; they were nowhere close to each
other.”</p>
<p>People were discussing what had just happened. Many hopped into
matchmaking in the hopes of being the next to go against
Dollar.</p>
<p>“Try it! See if you can match with him.” Tang Zhenliu also
jumped into matchmaking.</p>
<p>Yi Dongmu did not hesitate to matchmake. Qian Hezhen and the
people from the Ares Martial Hall were of the same mind, as
well.</p>
<p>Han Sen did indeed decide to have another fight, thinking there
was no point in leaving without warming up. He didn’t really care
about the people who were watching, he just wanted a fun time
sparring with people who were strong like Dancer.</p>
<p>Han Sen had learned a lot from Dancer’s Mechanical Fist. If he
used Mechanical Fist to fight back, he didn’t think he would have
been victorious.</p>
<p>But you had to be well-rounded if you wanted to excel in combat;
specializing in one area, such as the power of the fist, would
never be enough.</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen entered the arena. As soon as he was in,
countless spectators joined to watch.</p>
<p>“Yi Dongmu?” Tang Zhenliu saw who had been selected to go
against Dollar and was flabbergasted. He then laughed and said,
“They really are inseparable! So many people are matchmaking at the
same time but look who ends up being the one to fight him next!
They really are meant to fight each other. This is going to be fun.
I wonder how much progress Yi Dongmu has made in the past few
years?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Tang Zhenliu who recognized Yi Dongmu, many
others did so too. With wide eyes and mouths agape, no one expected
that after all these years, Yi Dongmu went up against Dollar
again.</p>
<p>People who had seen their last fight were extremely excited, and
they started screaming in anticipation. Those who didn’t know about
it asked around, and when they heard of what had transpired, became
just as feverous.</p>
<p>Fang Mingquan, who heard the news and quickly came to see, was
streaming this fight. His whole body became excited at the prospect
of those two fighting once again.</p>
<p>“God, what am I seeing? Yi Dongmu! It’s Yi Dongmu! After all
these years, could this fight prove to be Yi Dongmu’s much-desired
revenge?”</p>
