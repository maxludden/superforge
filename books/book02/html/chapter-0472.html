<p>Feeling the numbness in his brain, Han Sen was alerted by the
coolness from his pituitary, making his brain clearer than
ever.</p>
<p>“Brain crystals are indeed fantastic stuff. Unfortunately, its
effect will fade gradually. In the end, the brain will only be
developed slightly.” Han Sen put away the rest of the brain
crystals and looked to the triangular exit in the center of the
room.</p>
<p>The space inside the room was spherical. Other than the gap
where they came from, the only exit was the triangular tunnel
leading downward in the center of the room.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked to the tunnel and looked down, finding the
6-foot-long tunnel was connected to another spherical room.</p>
<p>“Ji Yanran, do you know what these spherical rooms are used
for?” Han Sen knew so little about Crystallizers that he had to
look to Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran shook her head and said, “In all the materials that
I’ve studied, there is no mentioning of such places. However, there
are many unsolved mysteries in Crystallizer civilization, so this
is normal.”</p>
<p>“Shall we go down and have a look? Maybe there are more brain
crystals,” Han Sen thought about it and said.</p>
<p>Li Mingtang and Wang Hou had entered the core area. However, the
guard crystal had followed them inside. Han Sen had no idea what
was happening in the core area, so they might encounter the guard
crystal if they followed Li Mingtang and Wang Hou, which was not
ideal.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it’s too risky,” Ji Yanran hesitated.</p>
<p>“It’s not risky.” Han Sen summoned Snow Charmer and sent her
down the triangular tunnel to find out what was inside the other
room.</p>
<p>Very soon, Han Sen made sure that it was an empty room. Snow
Charmer also found triangular tunnels leading to other places.</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated and summoned the beetle knight again, making
his doppelgänger hide inside the statue’s ear, watching the
entrance from which Li Mingtang and the rest entered the core area,
while he and Ji Yanran entered the other room through the
triangular tunnel.</p>
<p>Like Snow Charmer said, it was an empty room. On the side of the
room there was a triangular tunnel of the same size leading
horizontally to another spherical room.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Snow Charmer to climb into the tunnel first to
make sure there was no danger before he and Ji Yanran went inside
one by one.</p>
<p>It turned out that all the spherical rooms were empty, all
connected by triangular tunnels. After traveling past a dozen
spherical rooms, Ji Yanran and Han Sen ended up in a normal
room.</p>
<p>Walls of the room there were lined with black crystal cabinets
that had at least hundreds of lockers. There was no telling what
was inside.</p>
<p>“This is… the treasure…” Ji Yanran saw the black crystal
cabinets and became surprised.</p>
<p>“You’re saying this is the treasure? So, the simulating
crystals, parasite crystals, and guard crystals are all stored
here?” Han Sen was overjoyed he did not expect to come to the
treasure by accident.</p>
<p>“These black crystal cabinets are similar to the ones used to
store crystals that we had discovered before. However, this room is
different from the previous treasure. Also, I’m not sure why the
room is connected with those spherical rooms. Therefore, I could
not make sure whether this is the real treasure.” Ji Yanran was not
confident.</p>
<p>“Let’s open one up to find out.” Han Sen asked Ji Yanran to go
back into the previous spherical room and commanded Snow Charmer to
open up a square black crystal lcoker.</p>
<p>Nothing strange happened. The black crystal locker was empty.
There was nothing stored inside.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran came back to examine the inner structure of the
cabinet and said assertively, “Now I am sure that this is the
cabinet that holds the crystals. This should be a treasure, but it
seems too small for a royalty ruin. These cabinets could not even
be compared to those in some smaller ruins. It does not look like
it is designed for a royalty.”</p>
<p>“It’s good as long as it is a treasure. Maybe it is the private
collection of the royalty.” Han Sen was excited and asked Snow
Charmer to open up other cabinets.</p>
<p>However, dozens of cabinets all turned out to be empty, which
disappointed Han Sen a bit.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen did not want to accept zero gains, so he
commanded Snow Charmer to open up all the cabinets. After she had
opened 80+ cabinets, she finally saw twinkling light inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen was excited and quickly walked up to the cabinet. There
was a golden crystal inside the size of a snail. It was over with a
complicated cut, which made it look like a brilliant golden
diamond.</p>
<p>“It is a crystal?” Han Sen did not dare to move and asked Ji
Yanran.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran nodded and said, “This is an inactive crystal. Judging
from the look of it, it should be the Rubik’s cube that you had
seen.”</p>
<p>“It will not turn itself on, right?” Han Sen was startled.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran shook her head and smiled. “Definitely not. All the
crystals stored in the treasure are dormant until they are
activated by Crystallizers. However, it is impossible to find a
living Crystallizer to initiate these crystals. The guard crystals
are commonly seen, but normal ruins only have 2 x 2 or 3 x 3
Rubik’s cubes. Even in larger runes, the Rubik’s cubes are mostly 6
x 6. The 12 x 12 Rubik’s cube you saw is very rare and of high
value for collection and research. If this is also a 12 x 12
Rubik’s cube, then it is priceless.”</p>
<p>Hearing Ji Yanran say that, Han Sen was overjoyed, took out the
golden crystal, and stuffed it in his pocket. He said with a smile,
“Then I will put it away first.”</p>
<p>Ji Yanran knew what he was thinking but did not say anything,
just rolling her eyes at him.</p>
<p>With the finding of the guard crystal, Han Sen was even more
motivated. He told Snow Charmer to open up all the remaining
cabinets and soon discovered another crystal.</p>
<p>It was a white crystal. Han Sen looked to his girlfriend,
puzzled.</p>
<p>“This is the memory crystal, containing all the data left by the
Crystallizers. If one has enough mental power, one could directly
sense the content of the crystal. However, human nowadays could
hardly reach that level. They could only get part of the fragmented
information in the crystal relying on machines. Since this crystal
is left behind by a Crystallizer royalty, it might contain
important information. If we are all able to translate part of it,
maybe our science and technology could have another leap,” Ji
Yanran explained.</p>
<p>“Then I will put it away first.” Han Sen unapologetically took
this memory crystal as well.</p>
<p>“Did you hear something?” Han Sen suddenly noticed something and
looked to Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran shook her head and said, “What did you hear?”</p>
<p>As Han Sen was about to say something, he suddenly heard
something falling. Pink crystals as big as duck eggs started to
fall from the triangular tunnel from which they came down.
Momentarily, there were 100+ pink crystals present.</p>
<p>“Parasite crystals!” Both Ji Yanran and Han Sen exclaimed at the
same time.</p>
