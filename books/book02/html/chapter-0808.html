<p>“Big Brother, I still haven’t eaten any yet. You want your
charred brethren back?” Wang Yuhang’s hands trembled, as he handed
over a carved slice of roast goose to the newly-descended one.</p>
<p>“Quack!” The white goose angrily cried and tried to attack Wang
Yuhang.</p>
<p>“Bossman, I request your assistance once more!” Wang Yuhang
called and ran over to Han Sen’s side.</p>
<p>Han Sen took off into the skies, not wishing to kill their new
foe. Killing it could potentially draw the attention of more
creatures.</p>
<p>With Wang Yuhang in the vicinity, there was a high likelihood of
this very thing happening.</p>
<p>“Bossman, don’t run! Save me!” Wang Yuhang shouted as he
ran.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, I cannot save you this time. Run back to whence
you came!” Han Sen yelled down to him, from the safety of the
skies.</p>
<p>“Whence I came? Whence I came? I haven’t the faintest idea where
I am or how I might return to whence I came,” Wang Yuhang said in
flustered response.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you just kidnapped? Run to where those people brought
you. Do that and find a way to leave the goose’s ire on them.” Han
Sen wanted to see who the people that kidnapped Wang Yuhang
were.</p>
<p>“Could such a tactic work?” Wang Yuhang asked with
desperation.</p>
<p>“Just go. I am still here.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Bossman, if I am in absolute danger, I still beseech that you
save me!” Wang Yuhang yelled out, as he started to run.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Han Sen watched Wang Yuhang run a great
distance.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang led the goose without a single problem, and his
attraction and kiting skills were exemplary—as they always had
been. He led the goose by its nose, keeping it as close as he
could, all without sustaining any damage. He ran and ran, right
across the mountains.</p>
<p>He had scaled numerous mountains, and after passing over many,
Han Sen espied a camp sitting at the bottom of one particular
valley. There were many tents there, and Han Sen suspected that the
camp held at least two hundred people.</p>
<p>But because there were no flags or cloths bearing an emblem,
symbol, or logo pertaining to any particular organization, Han Sen
was unable to discern who they were. When Wang Yuhang reached the
camp, it caused a great scene as the campers scrambled from out of
their shelter in sudden distress.</p>
<p>The white goose was terrifyingly powerful, and the creature did
not spare the lives of those who dwelled in the camp. Scores of the
people there were killed, and many more of them were injured.</p>
<p>There was one man ordering his fellows to surround the goose,
and even after observing that, he was unable to tell who they were.
But one thing was for sure; they were well-trained. And even amidst
the chaos, the subordinates were each able to adhere to the
commands of their superiors and focus. Not a single person ran off,
despite the goose’s slaughter.</p>
<p>“Who are these people? They are pretty good. But if they cannot
deal with a single super creature, for what reason have they come
here?” As Han Sen pondered this puzzling conundrum, he saw
something strange happen to the people he observed down below.</p>
<p>Under the leader’s control, some people brought out a vial
containing some concoction. Then, they injected themselves with the
serum. Soon after, their muscles expanded and their eyes turned red
and a red horn burst forth from their foreheads.</p>
<p>“Blood-horn shura?” Han Sen thought, with much surprise. He
never did figure out where the blood-horn shura that assaulted him
came from. And although he most suspected Angel Gene, he hadn’t
found any proof to confirm it was them.</p>
<p>Of everything that might have occurred on his journey here,
encountering blood-horn shura was one of the most unlikely. And
now, viewing them with greater clarity, they didn’t look like shura
at all. They were simply humans that had forced mutations upon
themselves.</p>
<p>Despite the folly of their actions, they did look far stronger
following their injections and subsequent transformation into what
Han Sen had dubbed a blood-horn shura. For a while, they were able
to maintain their position but still, they were unable to slay the
goose that had descended upon them. That being said, the goose was
unable to totally destroy the camp now, too.</p>
<p>The elites amongst them that had opened their gene locks did not
use the medicine, and they instead took off after Wang Yuhang in
the desire of capturing him once more.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched what was going on for a while, and it seemed as
if no damage was being dealt to the wild goose. They seemed to be
running out of patience, and so one of the elites injected
themselves with the concoction.</p>
<p>Within seconds, the man’s muscles expanded by a vast amount. The
person’s head grew a horn and his lifeforce made a great leap in
power.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The man’s body burst into flames. He threw his fist forward
towards the white goose and incinerated a portion of the white
goose’s plumage.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Han Sen’s face was one of utter shock. The man had
dealt elemental damage through the manner of a projectile. Only
celestial beings were supposedly capable of doing such a thing.</p>
<p>Although the man had unlocked his gene lock, he was far away
from achieving such a level. Therefore, how was he able to do what
he had just done?</p>
<p>“What in the world is that medicine?” Han Sen wondered, with
distraught surprise. The white goose wasn’t heavily injured, but
after the fire-power-imbued man joined the fight with all the other
blood-horn shura, it was quickly put at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The white goose, seeing its sudden inability to win the battle,
cried out and flew away. The people were unable to catch up with
it, and so they could do little but watch it go.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could comprehend the situation, he realized he
had done naught but watch the events unfold with his jaw wide open.
Although the people weren’t too difficult to kill, the entire fact
that they had willingly transformed themselves into blood-horn
shura frightened Han Sen.</p>
<p>But before he did anything, like killing them, Han Sen knew he’d
have to collect intel and find out more about them first.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang, in the meantime, had been beaten up by the elites
and thrown back into a cage.</p>
<p>Luckily, despite his egregious luck, Wang Yuhang was not a dumb
person. Although he was back at square one, he didn’t call out for
Han Sen’s aid, and it seemed his kidnappers were still unaware of
the presence of other people on the Empty Island.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to watch them from afar, committed to
gathering as much information about them as he could. They beat up
Wang Yuhang, but not by a large amount. It was clear to him that
they wanted him for a particular purpose. Despite his attraction of
the super creature and the fatalities that ensued, they only locked
him up instead of killing him.</p>
<p>After a while, however, Han Sen noticed something interesting.
The people who used the medicine started to look like ordinary
humans after about an hour.</p>
<p>When they returned to looking like regular humans again, they
looked weak. They didn’t seem to be doing too well.</p>
<p>“It would appear that drug has negative side effects for its
users. That aside, the transformation itself does not seem to last
very long,” Han Sen talked to himself.</p>
<p>The serum seemed to last much longer on the man who had unlocked
his gene lock, however. For him to look like an average human
again, it took two hours.</p>
<p>But he too now looked weaker than usual. He looked pale, as if
he were drained of energy. He went inside a tent to rest.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to observe them. Their lifeforces
had become much weaker, and their fitness had dropped below one
hundred.</p>
<p>“Manager Qu, Wang Yuhang’s problems extend beyond mere bad luck.
In his short time with us, he has caused us much trouble. We have
sustained many losses, and I am afraid our army will be wasted
before that thing comes out.” Two people were engaged in
discussion, inside the leader’s tent.</p>
<p>Han Sen bent his ear their way, thinking he might pick up a
thing or two of interest.</p>
