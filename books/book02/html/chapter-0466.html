<p>“Li!” Seeing the warframe of Li Lu was shot down, the two
soldiers shot at the red crystal warframes madly using laser
guns.</p>
<p>“Come inside. Quickly,” Ji Yanran exclaimed at the two soldiers,
but it was too late.</p>
<p>Although the two soldiers shot down a few red crystal warframes,
they were taken out by more simulating crystals.</p>
<p>“Go!” Han Sen exclaimed and used his warframe arm to push Ji
Yanran’s.</p>
<p>Although those people were not his friends yet, Han Sen felt
upset seeing fellow humans die. However, now was not the time to be
sad. He could not watch Ji Yanran die like those soldiers.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran came back to herself, gritted her teeth, and operated
the warframe to go inside the ruin. They had to get rid of the
simulating crystals as soon as possible. Otherwise, she and Han Sen
would die as well.</p>
<p>Behind the black crystal gate, there was a crystal path. Ji
Yanran led Han Sen to go forward but did not dare to go too fast.
Very soon, the red crystal warframes started to catch up with
them.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry so much. Run quickly.” Han Sen knew that Ji Yanran
was worried about the traps in the ruin, but if they did not go
quickly, they would soon lose their lives.</p>
<p>The expert panel should have already entered the ruin. If there
were any traps, they should have triggered those already. Being
yelled at Han Sen, Ji Yanran suddenly understood that and operated
her warframe at full speed to go forward. After they ran for
several miles, the entered a huge architecture like a shelter. Many
paths were interconnected.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Ji Yanran took a look, but path looked
identical to each other. She had no idea where they were supposed
to go.</p>
<p>In addition, the paths were so narrow that the warframes could
not pass.</p>
<p>“Follow me.” Han Sen gritted his teeth, came out of the
warframe, and turned it into a briefcase. He ran ahead with the
warframe in his hand.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran copied Han Sen’s moves and followed him.</p>
<p>As Han Sen just entered the path, he quickly summoned the
snow-toothed wolf. A snow wolf suddenly appeared in front of Han
Sen. It was a beast soul mount, but Han Sen did not mean to ride on
it, only commanding it to go forward.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned to use the snow-toothed wolf as a scout. He knew
very little about Crystallizer ruins. However, since Ji Yanran did
not have any idea, he must make a decision, even if he did not know
whether his decision was right or not. Hesitation would only bring
them into bigger crisis.</p>
<p>The snow-toothed wolf was running forward, and Han Sen and Ji
Yanran were following with warframe cases in their hands. However,
the paths were so complicated that they lost the direction although
there were no dangers.</p>
<p>“It sounds quiet now. Let’s stop.” When reaching something like
a bridge, Han Sen looked down and stopped, looking at the weird
crystal statues.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran listened carefully and indeed heard no sound. She felt
relieved and looked to the crystal statues about 50 feet tall
each.</p>
<p>The statues were made of crystals of different colors. The
shapes of them looked rather odd. They were nothing like humans or
animals.</p>
<p>“Those are the deities that Crystallizers worshiped. Most
Crystallizer ruins had statues like these,” explained Ji Yanran as
she looked around.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not seem to be listening but fixed his eyes on one
statue.</p>
<p>“Come out, otherwise I would not be polite.” Han Sen squeezed
the warframe case in his hand and yelled coldly at the statue.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran looked to the statute, feeling puzzled. She did not
see anything, but very soon, someone walked from behind the
statue.</p>
<p>“Tang Xin? How are you here? Where is everyone else?” Ji Yanran
saw who it was and asked with her brows knitted.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. We scattered. Why are you here as well?” Tang Xin
walked to the two of them as he said.</p>
<p>“Stop. Otherwise I will shoot.” Han Sen quickly drew his mini
laser gun from his waist, pointed it at Tang Xin and said
coldly.</p>
<p>“Why should I stop?” Tang Xin did not pay Han Sen any mind and
continued to approach them.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Han Sen shot at Tang Xin’s head, taking
half of his skull away.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what did you do?” Ji Yanran was startled, not sure why
Han Sen did it.</p>
<p>However, Ji Yanran knew Han Sen must have a reason. Although
Tang Xin had offended Han Sen before, Ji Yanran knew he was not
someone who would commit murder because of a small grudge.</p>
<p>Without Han Sen explaining, she saw what was wrong. With half of
his goal grown, Tang Xin did not fall immediately but turned
around.</p>
<p>On Tang Xin’s back, a pink crystal the size of a duck egg was
set in his muscles. Red crystal hair was growing from the crystal,
driven into his entire back like veins, blinking red light as if he
got new heart. It looked both weird and sickening.</p>
<p>“Parasite crystal!” Ji Yanran was astonished, quickly drew her
gun and aimed at the crystal like Han Sen, ready to shot.</p>
<p>Before Ji Yanran shot Tang Xin, a slim hair grew from the
crystal and wrapped Tang Xin up entirely like a mummy.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Ji Yanran and Han Sen shot at the mummy like Tang Xin
repeatedly, but to no avail. The laser guns only broke a part of
the crystal hair, which quickly grew again.</p>
<p>“Laser weapons are useless. Use beast souls.” They suddenly
heard a voice say. Han Sen and Ji Yanran turned back and saw
Professor Li Mingtang and several young researchers coming from a
path nearby. It was Li Mingtang who said that.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen summoned his beast souls, someone came from
behind Li Mingtang. He held a beast soul sword and slashed at Tang
Xin and the crystal repeatedly, breaking the crystal.</p>
<p>“A cookhouse soldier does not belong here.” Wang Hou took back
his beast soul sword, stared at Han Sen coldly and said.</p>
<p>“A cookhouse soldier is also soldier,” Han Sen said calmly.</p>
<p>“If you want to throw your life away, suit yourself,” Wang Hou
said contemptuously and ignored Han Sen. He walked to Ji Yanran and
said, “Captain, why are you down here? You should not be here.”</p>
