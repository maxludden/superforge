<h2>Outdated Skts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 862</h3>

<p>The lounge of the restaurant had all the equipment necessary, so
everyone proceeded there at once to spectate the virtual fight.</p>
<p>“Little Han, are you okay?” Fat Squad Leader asked, as Han Sen
sat inside the hologram machine.</p>
<p>They had been mocked, yes; but their transgressors were from the
Royal Warframe Team. They were incredibly proficient at operating
warframes, and the person he was going up against was a surpasser
to boot. His foe’s fitness was higher than any evolver’s, which
gave him an advantage.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. I learned how to operate warframes back in
military school, and I actually put some effort in when it came to
practicing.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Fat Squad Leader then remembered that Han Sen had endorsed super
biological warframes. But over the years, there had been many more
generations and SK models. Those who endorsed the products had
generally switched and move on with the later releases.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s first-generation SKTS was undoubtedly the most
famous. The advert and the SKTS itself were widely regarded as
classics.</p>
<p>Of course, the adverts weren’t representative of their actual
operational functions. What he had learnt had been in school, so it
was natural for people to be dubious over whether or not Han Sen
could actually compete with professionals in today’s scene.</p>
<p>But it was too late now, and Han Sen’s crew could only hope for
the best. Their embarrassment would be even greater, if he
lost.</p>
<p>The Royal Warframe Team bunch, however, were acting as if they
had already secured victory. For this fight, they even got the
restaurant workers to stream the fight live on the TVs of the
restaurant.</p>
<p>People who visited this establishment were mostly soldiers,
those that had come here training. As such, this was a fight that
was sure to interest them.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a Royal Knight! Wasn’t that person ranked seventh in
the realm of evolver’s warframe combat. It has been a long time
since I last saw him.”</p>
<p>“It really is him! It’s Li Chengxian from the Royal Warframe
Team. He’s a surpasser now, so it is fairly obvious why you don’t
see him much, anymore.”</p>
<p>“Cool! Who is he going up against?”</p>
<p>“Some fellow with a strange ID. I’ve never heard of him
before.”</p>
<p>“It is a guest account.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Han Sen logged-in with a guest account, and this provided him
the ID of “Guest” followed by a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>Having received the invitation to battle from Li Chengxian, he
entered the combat arena. Instantly, the countdown began.</p>
<p>An old man sat down in the restaurant as the countdown started,
and he watched the screen of the TV intently. He couldn’t wait for
the match to begin.</p>
<p>Zhuo Donglai came here to chat with Han Sen, but did not expect
him to have gotten into a fight with Li Chengxian. He found the
prospects of their battle quite interesting.</p>
<p>“Soldiers from the Royal Warframe Team are very good when it
comes to the operation of warframes. They have much experience and
constantly make use of them. Han Sen most likely hasn’t touched a
warframe in many years, so I wonder what he’s going to do?” Zhuo
Donglai sipped on a glass of wine, deep in thought.</p>
<p>It had indeed been a long time since Han Sen operated a
warframe, and he wasn’t familiar with what models were currently
being used. He chose SKTS due to his familiarity with it, but it
was incredibly outdated by that point.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen select the SKTS, Li Chengxian coldly smiled. The
SKTS was a regular warframe, outdated and lacking high mobility.
Its weapons were unremarkable, and it lacked a variety of them. It
was generally considered unsuitable for battles against other
warframes.</p>
<p>Han Sen chose this warframe due to being familiar with it.</p>
<p>Li Chengxian wasn’t going to be polite or go easy on Han Sen,
though. He was ready to whip him like a dog and teach him a stern
lesson. Han Sen had mocked the males of their team, so to assert
the victory he wanted, Li Chengxian chose the best warframe
possible. It was a super biological warframe called “King of
War.”</p>
<p>King of War was the latest model, and it was five generations
ahead of the SKTS. Although this King of War was only a regular
variant instead of the military variant—which reduced the weapons
it possessed—it was fairly close.</p>
<p>Every man loved mechs, and in this age, super biological
warframes in particular. Whereas in the past, men might have been
car enthusiasts and later spaceship lovers, this was the latest
manly interest. Even if a man wasn’t crazy about machinery, they’d
still appreciate them.</p>
<p>Warframe matches were a popular sport to watch, and especially
so when a match included a member of the Royal Warframe Team.</p>
<p>Even men and soldiers who weren’t warframe operators enjoyed
watching the fights, and understood the intricacies of these
battles.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Chengxian select King of War, while his opponent used
an SKTS, they believed the duel was going to be some gentle
sparring and not a proper fight.</p>
<p>But still, many people tuned in to watch, due to one of the
fighters being associated with the Royal Warframe Team. It made for
great entertainment to accompany their meals.</p>
<p>When the countdown ended, King of War and SKTS appeared in the
arena. It was a plain battleground, and it lacked barriers. There,
they would simply fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s SKTS had a sword and a laser blaster, nothing
else.</p>
<p>King of War was decked out with a variety of weapons, like a
giant, mobile arsenal.</p>
<p>Li Chengxian looked at Han Sen’s basic, raw SKTS and cackled.
When he moved his hand, King of War came to life with thirteen
cannons immediately aiming for Han Sen. He’d blast the SKTS to
kingdom come before it even took a step towards him.</p>
<p>“Damn! Thirteen weapons all at once, that’s pretty powerful. And
talented! These Royal Knights really are a crazy lot. Awesome!”</p>
<p>“His abilities of warframe operation are way too good. He moves
the robot with an unmatched mixture of both speed and precision.
This is nuts!”</p>
<p>“The Royal Warframe Team really is no joke.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that poor soul. That guy in the SKTS will be nothing but
scrap metal before he takes his second step.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>When the SKTS moved, however, everyone was shocked. It was an
ordinary movement, but it made people feel as if the SKTS was
alive.</p>
<p>At that moment, they noticed a fluidity unlike anything they
thought a machine could perform. It was like the SKTS had melded
with the agility of a human.</p>
<p>The movements of the SKTS were delicate, and each step exuded a
sense of real soul. It was difficult for people to describe what
they were watching.</p>
<p>“Those quick movements… by the sanctuaries! Who is controlling
that SKTS? That’s insane!”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s shock, the SKTS continued its graceful dance
forward. The trail it took was strange, and when the cannons fired,
every shot missed and hit the ground around it.</p>
<p>The SKTS was like a silver phantom.</p>
