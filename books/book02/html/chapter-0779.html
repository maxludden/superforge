<h2>Flower Creature</h2>
<h3>Chapter 779</h3>

<p>The Emerald Golem was dying, and the little angel effortlessly
exploited its every weakness. Within half an hour, it would most
probably lie dead.</p>
<p>The Emerald Golem consistently cried and roared out, but it was
unable to do anything else. The little angel’s greatsword
repeatedly struck the neck of the Emerald Golem until its head was
hewn off.</p>
<p>It did not die when the head was removed, however. It continued
to fight the little angel, even with a headless body.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the little angel wasn’t human. Decapitating the
golem did not make her careless or have her drop her guard, and she
was able to dodge the headless golem’s surprise attack following
its beheading.</p>
<p>To ensure its defeat, the little angel spent the next several
hours hacking away the rest of the golem’s crystal limbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Super Creature Emerald Golem Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The
Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life
Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten
Super Geno Points Randomly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not receiving its beast soul was a little disappointing for Han
Sen, but regardless, he picked up the fallen creature’s green Life
Geno essence. He unsummoned the little angel and left the nest.</p>
<p>He did not return to the shelter, but traveled west instead.
During his research, he had learned of two nearby locations he
wanted to check out.</p>
<p>It was an area comprised of sprawling meadows, each painted with
innumerable flowers that were all knitted together. As serene as
the area was, the number of flowers put it on the radar for a great
many insects. Butterflies, bees, ants, and more frequented this
place.</p>
<p>But it was said there was something even spookier that resided
there, something that stilled the hearts and desires for all who
ventured near. To determine the validity of people’s fears, Han Sen
wanted to travel into the heart of the meadows and see for himself
whether or not there was a super creature residing there.</p>
<p>Bugs were known to produce many offspring. If there was a super
creature insect there, it might have been similar to the Devil Ant
King, and possess a large number of eggs.</p>
<p>The verdant expanse before him was quite lumpy, but it was
dressed with a sea of colorful flowers. These meadows went on and
on towards the horizon, appearing endless.</p>
<p>The flowers weren’t particularly large, but they grew close to
the soil and fit together as if to paint the ground. The colors did
not just stem from the large variety of flowers budding in harmonic
unison, but individual flowers themselves could possess up to eight
colors.</p>
<p>Countless butterflies and bees danced in the air around them,
yet no person ever went there to hunt.</p>
<p>Han Sen ventured into the flowery meadows and brought the silver
fox along with him. All the butterflies and bees made sure to
escape and flee for the lives in fear of the super creature
pet.</p>
<p>The little fairy retreated into her scallop shell. After
recovering from her wounds, the liquid inside no longer dealt her
harm. As such, she frequently enjoyed hiding inside it.</p>
<p>After walking for some time, Han Sen was given a big surprise.
He saw a person in the field, killing creatures. Many insects
swarmed towards him, but despite that, the man looked calm and
composed. Untouched by a single creature, he gently swung his sword
to slay each that came for him.</p>
<p>“Jing Jiwu?” When Han Sen recognized the man, he became even
more surprised. He was the monster from the Alliance’s Central
Military Academy. In the Military Academy’s League Game, in
archery, Han Sen won his first championship.</p>
<p>Jing Jiwu now caught sight of Han Sen’s approach, and sped up to
finish off the creatures that pestered him. Within a single second,
he managed to slay around a thousand butterflies. The field was,
for now, empty of the fluttering fiends. Once he was done, he
walked towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I never expected a chance encounter with you here, of all
places,” Jing Jiwu said casually as he approached Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I could not have expected this, either.” Han Sen smiled.
Although they were once opponents, it was nice to meet him
there.</p>
<p>“I have heard you are in possession of a super pet,” Jing Jiwu
said.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Han Sen nodded. High-class officers had long spread this
news, so it wasn’t at all surprising for Jing Jiwu to know about
the silver fox.</p>
<p>“Walk west for one hundred miles and you’ll come across a muddy
hill. There are many gold-winged bees there, and quite possibly
super creatures, too. If you are interested, you should go and take
a look,” Jing Jiwu said.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen bid his appreciation and then took off in the
direction he was told to go.</p>
<p>They didn’t speak much with one-another, but they were
cooperative and adherent to the other’s needs. Han Sen did not
doubt the information he was given.</p>
<p>“I was hoping we would one day meet again, and when we did, I’d
be strong enough to re-challenge you. I am short of that goal.”
Seeing Han Sen walk off, Jing Jiwu watched him go. He continued to
think to himself, “Yes, become stronger. Go further. Give me the
motivation to catch up with you. That will assuredly stoke a fire
in the hearts of humanity.”</p>
<p>Then he threw himself into the midst of another legion of
butterflies.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued traveling in the direction Jing Jiwu had
indicated, and after walking one hundred miles, he came across a
forty meter high hill that was shaped like a mushroom. There were
many small burrows underneath, from which golden-bees came in and
out of. They were each around the size of a fist.</p>
<p>“These really aren’t your average bees. I am afraid there might
indeed be a super creature in this place.” Han Sen was standing one
hundred meters away from the hill, yet the silver fox’s presence
did nothing to alarm the golden bees.</p>
<p>There had to be a super creature burrowed deep inside. If there
wasn’t, then the bees would have assuredly paid heed to the silver
fox’s approach. They’d have been long gone by now.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about how he might flush the bee king out
and see what manner of super creature he’d be dealing with. But as
he thought, he caught sight of a lone pretty flower atop the
hill.</p>
<p>The flower had no roots or leaves; it just stood there atop the
hill. It was a few meters wide and the petals looked like those of
a chinese rose.</p>
<p>The flower was mostly yellow, but it was colored with a few
streaks of red. It was very pretty. It also emitted a pleasant
smell. It was strong but not overwhelming, and just smelling that
fragrance compelled you to come closer and sniff it at a closer
distance.</p>
<p>The flower was beautiful. And it looked as if honey was oozing
from inside the bud. But despite the large number of golden-bees
that populated the area, not a single one ventured close to it.</p>
<p>“Strange. That is really strange. Why is there a lone flower
atop a beehive, remaining untouched by the bees that live below?
And the rest of the flowers in this place are no larger than my
finger, so why is this one so large? There must be something wrong
with this thing.” Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to scan the
flower.</p>
<p>Because it was quite far from him, he couldn’t scan it with much
detail. Still, he was able to grasp some sort of horrific lifeforce
where it lay.</p>
<p>“Is that flower producing creatures, or is it perhaps something
that strengthens your body?” Han Sen looked at the flower with a
strange look on his face, wanting to be as careful as possible.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen this sort of thing many times. Treasures like
this frequently had frightening monsters nearby, and such creatures
were never in short supply. Whenever such flowers matured, other
creatures were bound to show up.</p>
