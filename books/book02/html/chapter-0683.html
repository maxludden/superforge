<h2>The Evolved Angel</h2>
<h3>Chapter 683</h3>

<p>A few days passed and the angel had already evolved. When it
wasn’t in battle mode, it didn’t look different; it was still the
black-haired loli. But when her battle mode was engaged, she was
totally different.</p>
<p>She had blonde wavy hair, and she wore armor that looked like
jade. Even her wings looked jade. The adiraid looked really holy,
and it was difficult to look her in the eye.</p>
<p>The strange thing was that the adiraid wielded a transparent
greatsword. It was similar to the one that Han Sen first saw her
use when they met on the Mystery Island. The only difference was
that this looked far stronger.</p>
<p>“A pet beast soul can end up looking like this?” Han Sen
wondered, in awe. This was the first time he had ever seen
something like this.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon realized, however, that the greatsword was not
simple like a gear item. A piece of gear could not be put inside
the Sea of Soul, and the greatsword disappeared when the adiraid
exited her battle mode. It was not some ordinary gear.</p>
<p>Seeing the adiraid in her battle mode, like some glorious
valkyrie, Han Sen was ecstatic. The mere presence of the adiraid
was intimidating enough for others. Its strength could not be any
less than a super creature’s, either, that was for sure.</p>
<p>“You are finally here,” Han Sen said, with tears in his eyes. He
wanted to kiss the adiraid.</p>
<p>With the adiraid by his side, he no longer had to fear super
creatures. He could enter battle with them, guns-a-blazing, without
a care in the world.</p>
<p>But now, Han Sen’s focus was not on killing super creatures. He
wanted to quickly finish the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra and
see if he could absorb the bone elephant’s Life Geno essence.</p>
<p>If things were how he had guessed, Han Sen would have to be
selective of the super creatures he chose to do battle with in the
future; otherwise, there’d be no point in fighting them.</p>
<p>On the next red morning, Han Sen was sitting on a hill while he
practiced the Dongxuan Sutra. He had practiced half a cycle when
his eyebrows jumped up with the sudden sensation of approaching
danger.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not panic, so he maintained his practice of the
Dongxuan Sutra, even as twelve people encircled him.</p>
<p>Huang Yunlong and Cheng Yulang had exerted a lot of effort in
the formulation and execution of their plan of assassination. They
thought they’d need to commit to a big fight if they were going to
surround Han Sen. But they were able to walk right up to him, all
while he remained sitting and basking in the red morning light.</p>
<p>Huang Yunlong and Cheng Yulang were almost unable to believe how
smoothly their operation seemed to be going. They thought an elite
like Han Sen would detect them from a hundred meters away. And the
fact that he did not run away surprised them even more.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, we meet at last.” With everything going so smoothly,
Huang Yunlong was pleased.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored him. He was finishing his big cycle of the
Dongxuan Sutra. When it was done, he opened his eyes to see a dozen
people surrounding him, one of which was Huang Yunlong.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen observed everyone and ended up on Huang
Yunlong. He asked the question as he stood up.</p>
<p>“I am from the Cloud-Dragon Shelter in the north; I am Huang
Yunlong,” Huang Yunlong proudly introduced himself.</p>
<p>“What do the northern folks want from me, then?” Han Sen asked
calmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing big. I am just requesting that I purchase your Life
Geno essence,” Huang Yunlong said, smiling.</p>
<p>“How much are you willing to pay?” Han Sen responded.</p>
<p>“How much?” Cheng Yulang almost burst out laughing. He thought
Han Sen must have been retarded, to ask such a question in the
situation he was in.</p>
<p>“That much.” Cheng Yulang pulled out his wallet and threw a
small ten thousand note at Han Sen’s face, laughing.</p>
<p>He would have liked to throw out an even smaller note, but as
wealthy as he was, that was the smallest he had.</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s worth more than that,” Han Sen calmly replied, with
no deviation in his emotion. He was not mad, at all.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare announce he had gotten super geno points before,
because he knew others would come after him. Now that the cat was
out of the bag, it hadn’t been long before someone sought to bring
him harm, all for retrieving the Life Geno essence he owned.</p>
<p>The formation was fairly big. There were a dozen people, each
with an imposing, intimidating presence. They weren’t ordinary
evolvers. If he was able to bring that many strong fighters to
battle Han Sen, he had to be a man that possessed a lot of power.
He also had to be a man that was cruel, the sort who struck with
absolutes and assurances of death.</p>
<p>“The worth of the item is not up to you to decide. If I want to
buy it off you, you will have to sell it, and accept the price that
I propose.” Huang Yunlong looked callous. He didn’t say much else.
He then simply gestured with his hand, signaling for a dozen
fighters to unlock their gene locks and run towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Clearly, they wanted to kill Han Sen. And that was all they
needed to do, if they desired to own the Life Geno essence. The
Life Geno essence could not be placed in the Sea of Soul, and
neither could Han Sen consume it. It was up for grabs.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen knew they were strong, he hadn’t expected they
had all unlocked their gene locks. With power like this, the man
was doing pretty well for himself in the Second God’s
Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Without aid from the big families and prominent Alliance
organizations, it was difficult to gather a dozen elites with
unlocked gene locks.</p>
<p>In the past, Han Sen would have believed it difficult to fight
these assaulters. After all, he only had two fists. Being
surrounded by a dozen elites with unlocked gene locks, getting out
alive would be difficult.</p>
<p>But now things were different. Now, he had his battle adiraid.
Super pets had the potential to be as strong as super
creatures.</p>
<p>No matter how strong these elites were, if they could not kill a
super creature, they could not kill an adiraid.</p>
<p>Seeing that these cruel people wanted to murder him, Han Sen did
not respond any further. All he did was summon his adiraid.</p>
<p>The adiraid wielded a greatsword as she flapped her wings. It
was like a holy goddess, appearing in front of Han Sen. She coldly
looked at Huang Yunlong and his people.</p>
<p>Huang Yunlong saw the adiraid and was shocked. They thought Han
Sen was only summoning a spirit, as humanoid pets were very rare.
They never expected this.</p>
<p>But they did not understand why Han Sen was summoning a spirit.
If it was a royal spirit, it was nothing to them. Even spirits
could not fight that many talented fighters. It wouldn’t last a
second.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was using a spirit to buy himself time to escape, he
was too naïve.</p>
