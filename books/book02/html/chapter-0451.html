<p>When Han Sen started to practice Jadeskin, he was too old in
age. Since the foundation was not laid when he was a boy and he had
practiced the hyper geno art for a short time, Han Sen was not able
to make a big progress with it. Without the help of geno solutions,
until this day, he still was not able to make the first
breakthrough with Jadeskin.</p>
<p>Han Sen was stuck in a bottleneck and failed to make the
breakthrough. However, when he drank the geno solutions to practice
Micro Crystal, Jadeskin was activated unexpectedly and was pushed
to the first breakthrough.</p>
<p>Han Sen only had one feeling at this point.</p>
<p>Cold! Piercing and thrilling cold!</p>
<p>The cold did not come from the outside but seemed to come from
within. It was as if every single inch of his body was giving off
the coldness, making Han Sen feel like he was going to turn into an
ice statute.</p>
<p>He wanted to stop activation of Jadeskin, otherwise, wondered if
he would be frozen to death. However, Jadeskin was like a wild
horse that did not follow his control at all. The cold got worse
and worse, making Han Sen become unconscious.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep. If I fall asleep, I’m afraid I will not wake up
ever.” Han Sen knew very well what would happen to someone who fell
asleep in the snow, so he was striving to be lucid.</p>
<p>However, it did not help a lot. At this point, he could not even
move his fingers. His entire body was incredibly cold and even the
temperature in the room fell.</p>
<p>The thermostats did not seem to sense the drop in the room
temperature, so it was not working.</p>
<p>“Dammit! How come the thermostats is broken at this point. Is
God trying to kill me?” Han Sen wanted to smash the damned machine
but unfortunately, he could not even move.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an idea crossed Han Sen’s mind, which made him widen
his eyes. No way. There is no such a coincidence. The reason the
thermostats did not change only meant the room temperature did not
actually drop. The cold I am feeling is very likely just a
hallucination rather than a reality.</p>
<p>Thinking of that, Han Sen quickly gritted his teeth and told
himself, “I’m not cold… I’m not cold… everything is fake… It’s just
my hallucination…”</p>
<p>“Dammit, it’s really cold…” Han Sen felt like the psychological
suggestion did not really work, because he was actually frozen to
death. It felt like his heart was frozen and blood had stopped
flowing and became ice. The coldness went to his heart.</p>
<p>Gradually, the cold left him, and Han Sen started to feel warm.
It was like sunshine in winter, making his trembling body feel
better. Although it was not hot, it made him feel so comfortable
that he almost moaned.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen did not feel happy about it. He became even
more worried. He knew that the cold did not go away. The warmth
meant he was not far from death. As soon he was fooled by the heat
and fell asleep, he would never wake up. When he was discovered by
others, he would be a dead body.</p>
<p>He tried his best not to fall asleep, but he felt more and more
fuzzy. In the end, he could not help but fall asleep.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how long he had been sleeping. When he woke
up again, he felt so comfortable as if he had just stepped out of a
hot spring.</p>
<p>“What? I did not die?” Han Sen raised his hands incredulously
and pinched his cheeks. Feeling the pain, he yelped.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I did not die. This is not a dream!” Han Sen was
overjoyed. Before he fell asleep, he thought he was doomed.
However, nothing had really happened. It was as if he had just gone
to bed.</p>
<p>However, Han Sen felt his body was somewhat different. Although
he could not tell what was different, the feeling could not be
mistaken.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not wait to run Jadeskin in his body, trying to
figure out what had happened. The moment he started, he saw his two
hands had become transparent like ice or Jade.</p>
<p>These hands reminded Han Sen of Xue Longyan’s hands the only
time he met Xue Longyan. However, Han Sen’s hands were even more
fine than Xue Longyan’s. It was hard to believe they were human
hands.</p>
<p>“First breakthrough… I made the first breakthrough in Jadeskin…”
Han Sen practiced Jadeskin in excitement, turning his entire body
into Jade.</p>
<p>“Jadeskin… This is what Jadeskin truly meant… I made it!” Han
Sen could not resist his excitement. Watching his translucent body,
he almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>After insisting on practicing Jadeskin for so long, Han Sen
eventually made the first breakthrough, which laid the most
important foundation.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was still a bit too old to start, the fact that
he had made the first breakthrough with the hyper geno art made his
progress fall into the normal range.</p>
<p>Feeling endless power inside his body, Han Sen squeezed his
fists. Although the muscles and bones looked translucent, they were
as flexible as beef tendons. He did not feel hard to move around
but felt his senses were heightened.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped the running of Jadeskin and turned his body back
to normal. Looking at himself in the mirror, he saw his skin became
more tender and smooth. However, there was not much of a difference
between now and then. His eyes were more watery like gemstones,
which made him look quite charming.</p>
<p>“If I continue this way, I will be more and more like a gigolo.”
Feeding upset, Han Sen hoped he could look more masculine.</p>
<p>However, that was no big deal. There was no need to care about
the appearance. Han Sen ran Micro Crystal again, wanting to make
sure that he was still able to practice this hyper geno art.</p>
<p>Very soon, Han Sen opened his mouth wide. After practicing Micro
Crystal, he found that Micro Crystal was just a small part of
Jadeskin.</p>
<p>When he used Micro Crystal, Han Sen felt his body was toughened
because the body cells were crystallized, making him look like a
statue carved out of crystal.</p>
<p>“Micro Crystal, I achieved it…” Although Han Sen felt
incredulous, the fact was the fact. He indeed succeeded in
practicing Micro Crystal. Hew Han Sen looked was exactly what was
described in the Micro Crystal tutorial.</p>
<p>The hyper geno art that took others 2 to 3 decades to practice
was easily achieved by Han Sen. Even Han Sen himself could not
believe that was happening.</p>
<p>Shortly, Han Sen found that it was not really a fact worth
celebrating. The effect of Micro Crystal was far worse than
Jadeskin after he made the first breakthrough. The only good thing
about Micro Crystal was that now he had an excuse to cover the fact
that he had been practicing Jadeskin.</p>
