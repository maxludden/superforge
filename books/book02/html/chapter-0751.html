<p>Han Sen thought his brain had fried, or that something must have
possessed him to make him say what he had.</p>
<p>He had prepared a very touching speech, but somehow, his head
just said those words for no reason.</p>
<p>“I blame that beautiful night,” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was fuming mad, and she shouted at him with a
blistering rage. Still, she was yet to give her answer. She had not
said yes or no. Fortunately for him, when he saw her the next day,
the ring was still on her finger.</p>
<p>“Yanran, you said our grandfather wants to meet with me. When
should I go and see him?” Han Sen said, as he inched closer to her
with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“You have no shame. It’s still my grandfather,” Ji Yanran said,
with a touch of shyness coating her words.</p>
<p>“It’s all the same. Anyway, when should we go?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll go and see him in a couple of days, when I’m free. But
whatever you do, don’t talk your average bullshit nonsense when
you’re with him. He’s a traditional, serious man. He respects
others who are serious, just like him. Therefore, don’t be
yourself.” Ji Yanran accompanied her words with a threatening
face.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face turned red. He promised and said, “Don’t worry. I
must have been sick last night. I don’t usually say things like
that.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, you still owe me a true proposal,” Ji Yanran said on
the doorstep. Then, she spun around and took her leave.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. In his heart, he thought, “I was sincere
yesterday.”</p>
<p>He wouldn’t say that to Ji Yanran, but as she left, he shouted,
“Then give me back the ring; how else can I repeat it!?”</p>
<p>“Get another one.” Ji Yanran did not turn around but lifted her
arm for a backward wave. The ring fitted her finger perfectly.</p>
<p>Although it was expensive, it was extremely pretty.</p>
<p>“It was made by Ekado. It’s shiny jewelry and was worth a
hundred million.” Han Sen’s heart went under. It wasn’t the money
he was sad about, but whether or not he could find a ring that
looked as good.</p>
<p>“Can I actually get two engagement rings?” Han Sen
questioned.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could find another ring, Ji Yanran brought Han
Sen to the Ji family house.</p>
<p>It was a planet full of azure seas and still lakes. Forestry was
in abundance, and mountain ranges coursed the continents like white
threads. The air was clean and the environment was unspoiled. It
was more than suitable for humans to live in.</p>
<p>On this planet, there existed only one building, however. This
building was made of wood, constructed so that it would blend in
with the natural environment.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no architectural knowledge, but Ji Yanran said the
entire planet belonged to the Ji family. This house was where her
grandfather lived. It was like an entire, exclusive planet had been
reserved for her grandfather. Without permission, even other
members of the Ji family would not dare to visit.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew how rich the Ji family was. Without the wealth they
had, it would’ve been impossible for Ji Ruozhen to become
president.</p>
<p>As he stood in the middle of a pavilion, he breathed in the raw,
virgin air that passed through the pines up high and the grass down
low. It was incredibly refreshing, and the nature-scented
atmosphere could not compete with any man-made air.</p>
<p>“Miss Yanran, the master has requested that he meet with Han Sen
alone.” Outside the yard, Ji Yanran was stopped.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you must be polite to grandfather,” Ji Yanran
nervously reminded Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.” Han Sen comforted Ji Yanran and followed the
butler into the yard.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he’d see the house upon entering the yard, but
instead he saw a lake. Its surface was like a mirror, with a
pavilion at its center. They looked like one.</p>
<p>The only way to go to the pavilion was across a bridge, and as
he trod across it, he felt as if he was walking into a sublime
painting.</p>
<p>“It looks like this grandfather is an elegant man; quite unlike
me, it would seem.” Although he thought the place was beautiful,
Han Sen would not desire to live there. Technology and metropolitan
locales suited him far more.</p>
<p>“Sir, Mister Han is here.” The butler led Han Sen to the
pavilion and politely spoke.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Grandpa.” Han Sen walked up and bowed, speaking with
a soft tone of politeness. As he did so, he checked out the demigod
legend.</p>
<p>Ji Yanwu was the center of the Ji family. He was a demigod
elite, and quite famous in the Alliance. The Ji family’s reputation
in today’s age was owed to this man.</p>
<p>He was so well-respected, even Ji Ruozhen would not speak of him
in vain. He was a remarkable and important figure in the Ji
family.</p>
<p>He did look different than what Han Sen had envisioned, however.
He was a down-to-earth old man. His beard was white, but it was
well-kept and clearly groomed. He didn’t use technology to dye his
hair black, and you could even see the wrinkles on his skin.</p>
<p>He looked very serious, though. His eyes stopped on Han Sen, but
his emotions and thoughts were impossible to guess. That being
said, there was nothing snobbish to feel, when being in his
presence. All that you felt while being in his presence, was the
need to revere him. You would feel compelled to listen to
everything he said.</p>
<p>“Sit down.” Grandfather Ji pointed at the cushion in front of
him. He spoke with a calm voice.</p>
<p>Han Sen was awash with relief, not hearing him comment on his
calling him “grandpa.” Han Sen was feeling more confident about
things, and so he sat where he was bid to.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to marry Yanran?”</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just sat down, but such a question had already
been asked. It came as quite the shock. Grandfather Ji looked at
Han Sen, and his clear eyes looked as if they could read a person’s
mind. It made Han Sen feel as if he was naked in public, which made
him a little nervous.</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandpa. I am going to marry her, and I have come here to
request your permission to do so,” Han Sen said, all without
hesitation.</p>
<p>Grandfather Ji looked at Han Sen, and then put away his
scanner-like gaze. Then he said shortly, “That is good. You are
both still in service of the army. There is no rush to get married.
Pick a date and bring your mother to Ruozhen so you may discuss the
event.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he’d have to say and do a lot more than that,
but already, the talk had come to an end. He hardly spoke at all
and already, Grandfather Ji had bid that he return and make the
appropriate preparations at once. He felt as if he had wasted his
time earlier, thinking of all the ways he might approach and
explain stuff to the man.</p>
<p>After Han Sen was led out by the butler, a man and woman
approached from behind. It was Ji Ruozhen and his wife.</p>
<p>“Father, what do you think about this kid?” Ji Ruozhen
asked.</p>
<p>Although Ji Yanran was their daughter, they would still listen
to the opinion of Grandfather Ji.</p>
<p>“He is powerful. He is composed. In time, he can indeed become
something,” Grandfather Ji said.</p>
<p>Missus Ji sighed and said, “It is a shame he does not hail from
a bigger family.”</p>
<p>Although Han Sen could get everything he wanted in the Second
God’s Sanctuary, amidst the the rich families in the Alliance, his
influence was limited. He was just a young, smart guy—one without
prior wealth.</p>
<p>“It is fine to be without a remarkable background. He will be
given one, following his joining of our family,” Grandfather Ji
said.</p>
